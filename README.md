| **[MoEMba: A Mamba-based Mixture of Experts for High-Density EMG-based Hand Gesture Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17457v2)** | 2026-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-Density surface Electromyography (HDsEMG) has emerged as a pivotal resource for Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), offering direct insights into muscle activities and motion intentions. However, a significant challenge in practical implementations of HD-sEMG-based models is the low accuracy of inter-session and inter-subject classification. Variability between sessions can reach up to 40% due to the inherent temporal variability of HD-sEMG signals. Targeting this challenge, the paper introduces the MoEMba framework, a novel approach leveraging Selective StateSpace Models (SSMs) to enhance HD-sEMG-based gesture recognition. The MoEMba framework captures temporal dependencies and cross-channel interactions through channel attention techniques. Furthermore, wavelet feature modulation is integrated to capture multi-scale temporal and spatial relations, improving signal representation. Experimental results on the CapgMyo HD-sEMG dataset demonstrate that MoEMba achieves a balanced accuracy of 56.9%, outperforming its state-of-the-art counterparts. The proposed framework's robustness to session-to-session variability and its efficient handling of high-dimensional multivariate time series data highlight its potential for advancing HD-sEMG-powered HCI systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[PhysE-Inv: A Physics-Encoded Inverse Modeling approach for Arctic Snow Depth Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17074v3)** | 2026-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The accurate estimation of Arctic snow depth remains a critical time-varying inverse problem due to the scarcity in associated sea ice parameters. Existing process-based and data-driven models are either highly sensitive to sparse data or lack the physical interpretability required for climate-critical applications. To address this gap, we introduce PhysE-Inv, a novel framework that integrates a sophisticated sequential architecture, namely an LSTM Encoder-Decoder with Multi-head Attention and contrastive learning, with physics-guided inference. Our core innovation lies in a physics-constrained inversion methodology. This methodology first leverages the hydrostatic balance forward model as a target-formulation proxy, enabling effective learning in the absence of direct ground truth; second, it uses reconstruction physics regularization over a latent space to dynamically discover hidden physical parameters from noisy, incomplete time-series input. Evaluated against state-of-the-art baselines, PhysE-Inv significantly improves prediction performance, reducing error by 20% while demonstrating superior physical consistency and resilience to data sparsity compared to empirical methods. Beyond Arctic snow depth, PhysE-Inv can be applied broadly to other noisy, data-scarce problems in Earth and climate science.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adjacency Spectral Embeddings of Correlation Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21055v1)** | 2026-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In many applications, weighted networks are constructed based on time series data: each time series is associated to a vertex and edge weights are given by pairwise correlations. The result is a network whose edge dependency structure violates the assumptions of most common network models. Nonetheless, it is common to analyze these "correlation networks" using embedding methods derived from edge-independent network models, based on a belief that the edges are approximately independent. In this work, we put this modeling choice on firm theoretical ground. We show that when the time series are expressible in terms of a small number of Fourier basis elements (or in some other suitably-chosen basis), correlation networks correspond to latent space networks with dependent edge noise in which the vertex-level latent variables encode the basis coefficients. Further, we show that when time series are observed subject to noise, spectral embedding of the resulting noisy correlation network still recovers these true vertex-level latent representations under suitable assumptions. This characterization of embeddings as learning Fourier coefficients appears to be folklore in the signal processing community in the context of principal component analysis, but is, to the best of our knowledge, new to the statistical network analysis literature.</p></details> |  |
| **[Uncertainty Propagation Networks for Neural Ordinary Differential Equations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16815v2)** | 2026-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces Uncertainty Propagation Network (UPN), a novel family of neural differential equations that naturally incorporate uncertainty quantification into continuous-time modeling. Unlike existing neural ODEs that predict only state trajectories, UPN simultaneously model both state evolution and its associated uncertainty by parameterizing coupled differential equations for mean and covariance dynamics. The architecture efficiently propagates uncertainty through nonlinear dynamics without discretization artifacts by solving coupled ODEs for state and covariance evolution while enabling state-dependent, learnable process noise. The continuous-depth formulation adapts its evaluation strategy to each input's complexity, provides principled uncertainty quantification, and handles irregularly-sampled observations naturally. Experimental results demonstrate UPN's effectiveness across multiple domains: continuous normalizing flows (CNFs) with uncertainty quantification, time-series forecasting with well-calibrated confidence intervals, and robust trajectory prediction in both stable and chaotic dynamical systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[T1: One-to-One Channel-Head Binding for Multivariate Time-Series Imputation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21043v1)** | 2026-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Imputing missing values in multivariate time series remains challenging, especially under diverse missing patterns and heavy missingness. Existing methods suffer from suboptimal performance as corrupted temporal features hinder effective cross-variable information transfer, amplifying reconstruction errors. Robust imputation requires both extracting temporal patterns from sparse observations within each variable and selectively transferring information across variables--yet current approaches excel at one while compromising the other. We introduce T1 (Time series imputation with 1-to-1 channel-head binding), a CNN-Transformer hybrid architecture that achieves robust imputation through Channel-Head Binding--a mechanism creating one-to-one correspondence between CNN channels and attention heads. This design enables selective information transfer: when missingness corrupts certain temporal patterns, their corresponding attention pathways adaptively down-weight based on remaining observable patterns while preserving reliable cross-variable connections through unaffected channels. Experiments on 11 benchmark datasets demonstrate that T1 achieves state-of-the-art performance, reducing MSE by 46% on average compared to the second-best baseline, with particularly strong gains under extreme sparsity (70% missing ratio). The model generalizes to unseen missing patterns without retraining and uses a consistent hyperparameter configuration across all datasets. The code is available at https://github.com/Oppenheimerdinger/T1.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICLR 2026</p></details> |
| **[Towards Robust Real-World Multivariate Time Series Forecasting: A Unified Framework for Dependency, Asynchrony, and Missingness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08660v3)** | 2026-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-world time series data are inherently multivariate, often exhibiting complex inter-channel dependencies. Each channel is typically sampled at its own period and is prone to missing values due to various practical and operational constraints. These characteristics pose three fundamental challenges involving channel dependency, sampling asynchrony, and missingness, all of which must be addressed simultaneously to enable robust and reliable forecasting in practical settings. However, existing architectures typically address only parts of these challenges in isolation and still rely on simplifying assumptions, leaving unresolved the combined challenges of asynchronous channel sampling, test-time missing blocks, and intricate inter-channel dependencies. To bridge this gap, we propose ChannelTokenFormer, a Transformer-based forecasting framework with a flexible architecture designed to explicitly capture cross-channel interactions, accommodate channel-wise asynchronous sampling, and effectively handle missing values. Extensive experiments on public benchmark datasets reflecting practical settings, along with one private real-world industrial dataset, demonstrate the superior robustness and accuracy of ChannelTokenFormer under challenging real-world conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the 14th International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR 2026)</p></details> |
| **[Functional Continuous Decomposition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20857v1)** | 2026-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The analysis of non-stationary time-series data requires insight into its local and global patterns with physical interpretability. However, traditional smoothing algorithms, such as B-splines, Savitzky-Golay filtering, and Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD), lack the ability to perform parametric optimization with guaranteed continuity. In this paper, we propose Functional Continuous Decomposition (FCD), a JAX-accelerated framework that performs parametric, continuous optimization on a wide range of mathematical functions. By using Levenberg-Marquardt optimization to achieve up to $C^1$ continuous fitting, FCD transforms raw time-series data into $M$ modes that capture different temporal patterns from short-term to long-term trends. Applications of FCD include physics, medicine, financial analysis, and machine learning, where it is commonly used for the analysis of signal temporal patterns, optimized parameters, derivatives, and integrals of decomposition. Furthermore, FCD can be applied for physical analysis and feature extraction with an average SRMSE of 0.735 per segment and a speed of 0.47s on full decomposition of 1,000 points. Finally, we demonstrate that a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) enhanced with FCD features, such as optimized function values, parameters, and derivatives, achieved 16.8% faster convergence and 2.5% higher accuracy over a standard CNN.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 9 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |
| **[From Samples to Scenarios: A New Paradigm for Probabilistic Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19975v2)** | 2026-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most state-of-the-art probabilistic time series forecasting models rely on sampling to represent future uncertainty. However, this paradigm suffers from inherent limitations, such as lacking explicit probabilities, inadequate coverage, and high computational costs. In this work, we introduce \textbf{Probabilistic Scenarios}, an alternative paradigm designed to address the limitations of sampling. It operates by directly producing a finite set of \{Scenario, Probability\} pairs, thus avoiding Monte Carlo-like approximation. To validate this paradigm, we propose \textbf{TimePrism}, a simple model composed of only three parallel linear layers. Surprisingly, TimePrism achieves 9 out of 10 state-of-the-art results across five benchmark datasets on two metrics. The effectiveness of our paradigm comes from a fundamental reframing of the learning objective. Instead of modeling an entire continuous probability space, the model learns to represent a set of plausible scenarios and corresponding probabilities. Our work demonstrates the potential of the Probabilistic Scenarios paradigm, opening a promising research direction in forecasting beyond sampling.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICLR 2026</p></details> |
| **[Tree crop mapping of South America reveals links to deforestation and conservation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17372v2)** | 2026-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Monitoring tree crop expansion is vital for zero-deforestation policies like the European Union's Regulation on Deforestation-free Products (EUDR). However, these efforts are hindered by a lack of highresolution data distinguishing diverse agricultural systems from forests. Here, we present the first 10m-resolution tree crop map for South America, generated using a multi-modal, spatio-temporal deep learning model trained on Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 satellite imagery time series. The map identifies approximately 11 million hectares of tree crops, 23% of which is linked to 2000-2020 forest cover loss. Critically, our analysis reveals that existing regulatory maps supporting the EUDR often classify established agriculture, particularly smallholder agroforestry, as "forest". This discrepancy risks false deforestation alerts and unfair penalties for small-scale farmers. Our work mitigates this risk by providing a high-resolution baseline, supporting conservation policies that are effective, inclusive, and equitable.</p></details> |  |
| **[On Electric Vehicle Energy Demand Forecasting and the Effect of Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20782v1)** | 2026-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The wide spread of new energy resources, smart devices, and demand side management strategies has motivated several analytics operations, from infrastructure load modeling to user behavior profiling. Energy Demand Forecasting (EDF) of Electric Vehicle Supply Equipments (EVSEs) is one of the most critical operations for ensuring efficient energy management and sustainability, since it enables utility providers to anticipate energy/power demand, optimize resource allocation, and implement proactive measures to improve grid reliability. However, accurate EDF is a challenging problem due to external factors, such as the varying user routines, weather conditions, driving behaviors, unknown state of charge, etc. Furthermore, as concerns and restrictions about privacy and sustainability have grown, training data has become increasingly fragmented, resulting in distributed datasets scattered across different data silos and/or edge devices, calling for federated learning solutions. In this paper, we investigate different well-established time series forecasting methodologies to address the EDF problem, from statistical methods (the ARIMA family) to traditional machine learning models (such as XGBoost) and deep neural networks (GRU and LSTM). We provide an overview of these methods through a performance comparison over four real-world EVSE datasets, evaluated under both centralized and federated learning paradigms, focusing on the trade-offs between forecasting fidelity, privacy preservation, and energy overheads. Our experimental results demonstrate, on the one hand, the superiority of gradient boosted trees (XGBoost) over statistical and NN-based models in both prediction accuracy and energy efficiency and, on the other hand, an insight that Federated Learning-enabled models balance these factors, offering a promising direction for decentralized energy demand forecasting.</p></details> |  |
| **[TimeOmni-1: Incentivizing Complex Reasoning with Time Series in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24803v3)** | 2026-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in multimodal time series learning underscore a paradigm shift from analytics centered on basic patterns toward advanced time series understanding and reasoning. However, existing multimodal time series datasets mostly remain at the level of surface alignment and question answering, without reaching the depth of genuine reasoning. The absence of well-defined tasks that genuinely require time series reasoning, along with the scarcity of high-quality data, has limited progress in building practical time series reasoning models (TSRMs). To this end, we introduce Time Series Reasoning Suite (TSR-Suite), which formalizes four atomic tasks that span three fundamental capabilities for reasoning with time series: (1) perception, acquired through scenario understanding and causality discovery; (2) extrapolation, realized via event-aware forecasting; and (3) decision-making, developed through deliberation over perception and extrapolation. TSR-Suite is the first comprehensive time series reasoning suite that supports not only thorough evaluation but also the data pipeline and training of TSRMs. It contains more than 23K samples, of which 2.3K are carefully curated through a human-guided hierarchical annotation process. Building on this foundation, we introduce TimeOmni-1, the first unified reasoning model designed to address diverse real-world problems demanding time series reasoning. The model is trained in multiple stages, integrating a mixture of task scenarios, novel reward functions, and tailored optimizations. Experiments show that TimeOmni-1 delivers strong out-of-distribution generalization across all tasks and achieves a high rate of valid responses. It significantly improves causality discovery accuracy (64.0% vs. 35.9% with GPT-4.1) and raises the valid response rate by over 6% compared to GPT-4.1 on the event-aware forecasting task.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the 14th International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR 2026)</p></details> |
| **[FREQuency ATTribution: benchmarking frequency-based occlusion for time series data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18481v2)** | 2026-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep neural networks are among the most successful algorithms in terms of performance and scalability across different domains. However, since these networks are black boxes, their usability is severely restricted due to a lack of interpretability. Existing interpretability methods do not address the analysis of time-series-based networks specifically enough. This paper shows that an analysis in the frequency domain can not only highlight relevant areas in the input signal better than existing methods but is also more robust to fluctuations in the signal. In this paper, FreqAtt is presented - a framework that enables post-hoc interpretation of time-series analysis. To achieve this, the relevant frequencies are evaluated, and the signal is either filtered or the relevant input data is marked. FreqAtt is evaluated using a wide range of statistical metrics to provide a broad overview of its performance. The results show that using frequency-based attribution, especially in combination with traditional attribution on top of the frequency-optimized signal, provides strong performance across different metrics.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages, 16 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |
| **[Bikelution: Federated Gradient-Boosting for Scalable Shared Micro-Mobility Demand Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20671v1)** | 2026-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid growth of dockless bike-sharing systems has generated massive spatio-temporal datasets useful for fleet allocation, congestion reduction, and sustainable mobility. Bike demand, however, depends on several external factors, making traditional time-series models insufficient. Centralized Machine Learning (CML) yields high-accuracy forecasts but raises privacy and bandwidth issues when data are distributed across edge devices. To overcome these limitations, we propose Bikelution, an efficient Federated Learning (FL) solution based on gradient-boosted trees that preserves privacy while delivering accurate mid-term demand forecasts up to six hours ahead. Experiments on three real-world BSS datasets show that Bikelution is comparable to its CML-based variant and outperforms the current state-of-the-art. The results highlight the feasibility of privacy-aware demand forecasting and outline the trade-offs between FL and CML approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[Physics-based phenomenological characterization of cross-modal bias in multimodal models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20624v1)** | 2026-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The term 'algorithmic fairness' is used to evaluate whether AI models operate fairly in both comparative (where fairness is understood as formal equality, such as "treat like cases as like") and non-comparative (where unfairness arises from the model's inaccuracy, arbitrariness, or inscrutability) contexts. Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are breaking new ground in multimodal understanding, reasoning, and generation; however, we argue that inconspicuous distortions arising from complex multimodal interaction dynamics can lead to systematic bias. The purpose of this position paper is twofold: first, it is intended to acquaint AI researchers with phenomenological explainable approaches that rely on the physical entities that the machine experiences during training/inference, as opposed to the traditional cognitivist symbolic account or metaphysical approaches; second, it is to state that this phenomenological doctrine will be practically useful for tackling algorithmic fairness issues in MLLMs. We develop a surrogate physics-based model that describes transformer dynamics (i.e., semantic network structure and self-/cross-attention) to analyze the dynamics of cross-modal bias in MLLM, which are not fully captured by conventional embedding- or representation-level analyses. We support this position through multi-input diagnostic experiments: 1) perturbation-based analyses of emotion classification using Qwen2.5-Omni and Gemma 3n, and 2) dynamical analysis of Lorenz chaotic time-series prediction through the physical surrogate. Across two architecturally distinct MLLMs, we show that multimodal inputs can reinforce modality dominance rather than mitigate it, as revealed by structured error-attractor patterns under systematic label perturbation, complemented by dynamical analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>Best ...</summary><p>Best Paper Award at BiasinAI track in AAAI2026</p></details> |
| **[L2T-Hyena: Enhancing State-Space Models with an Adaptive Learn-to-Teach Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05926v3)** | 2026-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>State-space models (SSMs) have recently emerged as efficient alternatives to computationally intensive architectures such as Transformers for sequence modeling. However, their training typically relies on static loss functions, which may be suboptimal at different stages of learning. In this work, we introduce a hybrid model that integrates the Hyena architecture with a Dynamic Loss Network (DLN) under a Learning-to-Teach (L2T) paradigm, referred to as L2T-DLN. In this framework, the Hyena model serves as a student whose loss function is adapted online, while a teacher model, equipped with a memory of the student's past performance, guides the DLN to dynamically trade off the primary cross-entropy objective and a regularization term. We evaluate the proposed L2T-Hyena model on the Penn Treebank (PTB) and WikiText-103 language modeling benchmarks and compare it against both a vanilla Hyena SSM and a Transformer baseline. On PTB, our model achieves a validation perplexity of 102.6, representing a substantial improvement over the 110.5 obtained by the vanilla Hyena trained with a static loss function and 121.28 achieved by the Transformer baseline. Similar gains are observed on WikiText-103, where L2T-Hyena reaches a validation perplexity of 68.3, outperforming vanilla Hyena (73.7) and Transformer (89.8). These results indicate that coupling SSMs with adaptive loss functions can significantly enhance both the quality and efficiency of deep learning models for sequential data and hold strong promise for applications in natural language processing, time-series analysis, and biological signal processing.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 8 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |
| **[KairosVL: Orchestrating Time Series and Semantics for Unified Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20494v1)** | 2026-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Driven by the increasingly complex and decision-oriented demands of time series analysis, we introduce the Semantic-Conditional Time Series Reasoning task, which extends conventional time series analysis beyond purely numerical modeling to incorporate contextual and semantic understanding. To further enhance the mode's reasoning capabilities on complex time series problems, we propose a two-round reinforcement learning framework: the first round strengthens the mode's perception of fundamental temporal primitives, while the second focuses on semantic-conditioned reasoning. The resulting model, KairosVL, achieves competitive performance across both synthetic and real-world tasks. Extensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrate that our framework not only boosts performance but also preserves intrinsic reasoning ability and significantly improves generalization to unseen scenarios. To summarize, our work highlights the potential of combining semantic reasoning with temporal modeling and provides a practical framework for real-world time series intelligence, which is in urgent demand.</p></details> |  |
| **[CGSTA: Cross-Scale Graph Contrast with Stability-Aware Alignment for Multivariate Time-Series Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20468v1)** | 2026-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multivariate time-series anomaly detection is essential for reliable industrial control, telemetry, and service monitoring. However, the evolving inter-variable dependencies and inevitable noise render it challenging. Existing methods often use single-scale graphs or instance-level contrast. Moreover, learned dynamic graphs can overfit noise without a stable anchor, causing false alarms or misses. To address these challenges, we propose the CGSTA framework with two key innovations. First, Dynamic Layered Graph Construction (DLGC) forms local, regional, and global views of variable relations for each sliding window; rather than contrasting whole windows, Contrastive Discrimination across Scales (CDS) contrasts graph representations within each view and aligns the same window across views to make learning structure-aware. Second, Stability-Aware Alignment (SAA) maintains a per-scale stable reference learned from normal data and guides the current window's fast-changing graphs toward it to suppress noise. We fuse the multi-scale and temporal features and use a conditional density estimator to produce per-time-step anomaly scores. Across four benchmarks, CGSTA delivers optimal performance on PSM and WADI, and is comparable to the baseline methods on SWaT and SMAP.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by DASFAA'26</p></details> |
| **[Pre-training Epidemic Time Series Forecasters with Compartmental Prototypes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03393v6)** | 2026-02-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate epidemic forecasting is crucial for outbreak preparedness, but existing data-driven models are often brittle. Typically trained on a single pathogen, they struggle with data scarcity during new outbreaks and fail under distribution shifts caused by viral evolution or interventions. However, decades of surveillance data and the design of various compartmental models from diverse diseases offer an untapped source of transferable knowledge. To leverage the collective lessons from history, we propose CAPE, the first open-source pre-trained model for epidemic forecasting. Unlike existing time series foundation models that overlook epidemiological challenges, CAPE models epidemic dynamics as mixtures of latent compartmental population states, termed \textit{compartmental prototypes}. It models a flexible dictionary of compartment prototypes directly from a large collection of simulation data, enabling each outbreak to be expressed as a time-varying mixture that links observed infections to latent population states. To promote robust generalization, CAPE adopts the next-token-prediction paradigm during pre-training with lightweight epidemic-aware regularization that aligns the learned prototypes with epidemiological semantics. On a comprehensive benchmark spanning 17 diseases, CAPE significantly outperforms strong baselines with zero-shot forecasting. This work represents a principled step toward pre-trained epidemic models that are both transferable and epidemiologically grounded. We provide our code in: https://github.com/nuuuh/CAPE.</p></details> | version 3.0 |
| **[Stochastic Quantum Spiking Neural Networks with Quantum Memory and Local Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21324v2)** | 2026-02-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neuromorphic and quantum computing have recently emerged as promising paradigms for advancing artificial intelligence, each offering complementary strengths. Neuromorphic systems built on spiking neurons excel at processing time series data efficiently through sparse, event-driven computation, consuming energy only upon input events. Quantum computing, on the other hand, operates on state spaces that grow exponentially in dimension with the number of qubits -- as a consequence of tensor-product composition -- with quantum states admitting superposition across basis states and entanglement between subsystems. Hybrid approaches combining these paradigms have begun to show potential, but existing quantum spiking models have important limitations. Notably, they implement classical memory mechanisms on single qubits, requiring repeated measurements to estimate firing probabilities, while relying on conventional backpropagation for training. In this paper, we propose a novel stochastic quantum spiking (SQS) neuron model that addresses these challenges. The SQS neuron uses multi-qubit quantum circuits to realize a spiking unit with internal quantum memory, enabling event-driven probabilistic spike generation in a single shot during inference. Furthermore, we study networks of SQS neurons, dubbed SQS neural networks (SQSNN), and demonstrate that they can be trained via a hardware-friendly local learning rule, eliminating the need for global classical backpropagation. The proposed SQSNN model is shown via experiments with both conventional and neuromorphic datasets to improve over previous quantum spiking neural networks, as well as over classical counterparts, when fixing the overall number of trainable parameters.</p></details> |  |
| **[In-context Pre-trained Time-Series Foundation Models adapt to Unseen Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20307v1)** | 2026-02-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time-series foundation models (TSFMs) have demonstrated strong generalization capabilities across diverse datasets and tasks. However, existing foundation models are typically pre-trained to enhance performance on specific tasks and often struggle to generalize to unseen tasks without fine-tuning. To address this limitation, we propose augmenting TSFMs with In-Context Learning (ICL) capabilities, enabling them to perform test-time inference by dynamically adapting to input-output relationships provided within the context. Our framework, In-Context Time-series Pre-training (ICTP), restructures the original pre-training data to equip the backbone TSFM with ICL capabilities, enabling adaptation to unseen tasks. Experiments demonstrate that ICT improves the performance of state-of-the-art TSFMs by approximately 11.4% on unseen tasks without requiring fine-tuning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Training-Free Generative Modeling via Kernelized Stochastic Interpolants](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20070v1)** | 2026-02-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We develop a kernel method for generative modeling within the stochastic interpolant framework, replacing neural network training with linear systems. The drift of the generative SDE is $\hat b_t(x) = \nablaφ(x)^\topη_t$, where $η_t\in\R^P$ solves a $P\times P$ system computable from data, with $P$ independent of the data dimension $d$. Since estimates are inexact, the diffusion coefficient $D_t$ affects sample quality; the optimal $D_t^*$ from Girsanov diverges at $t=0$, but this poses no difficulty and we develop an integrator that handles it seamlessly. The framework accommodates diverse feature maps -- scattering transforms, pretrained generative models etc. -- enabling training-free generation and model combination. We demonstrate the approach on financial time series, turbulence, and image generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generalized dynamic functional principal component analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16024v2)** | 2026-02-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we explore dimension reduction for functional time series. We propose a generalized dynamic functional principal component analysis (GDFPCA) which does not rely on spectral density estimation and demonstrates strong empirical performance for both stationary and nonstationary functional time series. We define the generalized dynamic functional principal components (GDFPCs) as static factor time series in a functional dynamic factor model and obtain their multivariate representation from a truncation of the functional dynamic factor model. Estimation is based on a least-squares reconstruction criterion and implemented via a two-step procedure for the coefficient vectors of the loading curves under a basis expansion. We establish mean-square consistency of the reconstructed functional time series under weak stationarity. Simulation studies show that GDFPCA performs comparably to dynamic functional principal component analysis (DFPCA) for stationary data, while providing improved reconstruction accuracy in nonstationary settings, where both DFPCA and functional principal component analysis (FPCA) deteriorate. Applications to real datasets support the empirical advantages observed in the simulations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Change point analysis of high-dimensional data using random projections](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19988v1)** | 2026-02-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper develops a novel change point identification method for high-dimensional data using random projections. By projecting high-dimensional time series into a one-dimensional space, we are able to leverage the rich literature for univariate time series. We propose applying random projections multiple times and then combining the univariate test results using existing multiple comparison methods. Simulation results suggest that the proposed method tends to have better size and power, with more accurate location estimation. At the same time, random projections may introduce variability in the estimated locations. To enhance stability in practice, we recommend repeating the procedure, and using the mode of the estimated locations as a guide for the final change point estimate. An application to an Australian temperature dataset is presented. This study, though limited to the single change point setting, demonstrates the usefulness of random projections in change point analysis.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multivariate time-series forecasting of ASTRI-Horn monitoring data: A Normal Behavior Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19984v1)** | 2026-02-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study presents a Normal Behavior Model (NBM) developed to forecast monitoring time-series data from the ASTRI-Horn Cherenkov telescope under normal operating conditions. The analysis focused on 15 physical variables acquired by the Telescope Control Unit between September 2022 and July 2024, representing sensor measurements from the Azimuth and Elevation motors. After data cleaning, resampling, feature selection, and correlation analysis, the dataset was segmented into fixed-length intervals, in which the first I samples represented the input sequence provided to the model, while the forecast length, T, indicated the number of future time steps to be predicted. A sliding-window technique was then applied to increase the number of intervals. A Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) was trained to perform multivariate forecasting across all features simultaneously. Model performance was evaluated using the Mean Squared Error (MSE) and the Normalized Median Absolute Deviation (NMAD), and it was also benchmarked against a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network. The MLP model demonstrated consistent results across different features and I-T configurations, and matched the performance of the LSTM while converging faster. It achieved an MSE of 0.019+/-0.003 and an NMAD of 0.032+/-0.009 on the test set under its best configuration (4 hidden layers, 720 units per layer, and I-T lengths of 300 samples each, corresponding to 5 hours at 1-minute resolution). Extending the forecast horizon up to 6.5 hours-the maximum allowed by this configuration-did not degrade performance, confirming the model's effectiveness in providing reliable hour-scale predictions. The proposed NBM provides a powerful tool for enabling early anomaly detection in online ASTRI-Horn monitoring time series, offering a basis for the future development of a prognostics and health management system that supports predictive maintenance.</p></details> | 15 pages, 12 figures |
| **[A Two-Step Spatio-Temporal Framework for Turbine-Height Wind Estimation at Unmonitored Sites from Sparse Meteorological Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19954v1)** | 2026-02-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate estimates of wind speeds at wind turbine hub heights are crucial for both wind resource assessment and day-to-day management of electricity grids with high renewable penetration. In the absence of direct measurements, parametric models are commonly used to extrapolate wind speeds from observed heights to turbine heights. Recent literature has proposed extensions to allow for spatially or temporally varying vertical wind gradients, that is, the rate at which wind speed changes with height. However, these approaches typically assume that reference height and hub height measurements are available at the same locations, which limits their applicability in operational settings where meteorological stations and wind farms are spatially separated. In this paper, we develop a two-step spatio-temporal framework to estimate turbine height wind speeds using only open-access observations from sparse meteorological stations. First, a non-parametric generalized additive model is trained on reanalysis data to perform vertical height extrapolation. Second, a spatial Gaussian process model interpolates these hub-height estimates to wind farm locations while explicitly propagating uncertainty from the height extrapolation stage. The proposed framework enables the construction of high-resolution, sub-hourly turbine-height wind speed time series and spatial wind maps using data available in real time, capabilities not provided by existing reanalysis products. We further provide calibrated uncertainty estimates that account for both vertical extrapolation and spatial interpolation errors. The approach is validated using hub-height measurements from seven operational wind farms in Ireland, demonstrating improved accuracy relative to ERA5 reanalysis while relying solely on real-time, open-access data.</p></details> |  |

Anomaly detection (AD) can identify deviations from expected patterns in data, which can be used to trigger failsafe behaviors and recovery strategies. Prior work has applied data-driven AD on time series data for specific robotic tasks, however the transferability of an AD approach between different robot control strategies and task types has not been shown. Leveraging time series data, such as force/torque signals, allows to directly capture robot-environment interactions, crucial for manipulation and online failure detection. As robotic tasks can have widely signal characteristics and requirements, AD methods which can be applied in the same way to a wide range of tasks is needed, ideally with good data efficiency. We examine three industrial robotic tasks, robotic cabling, screwing, and sanding, each with multi-modal time series data and several anomalies. Several autoencoderbased methods are compared, and we evaluate the generalization across different robotic tasks and control methods (diffusion policy-, position-, and impedance-controlled). This allows us to validate the integration of AD in complex tasks involving tighter tolerances and variation from both the robot and its environment. Additionally, we evaluate data efficiency, detection latency, and task characteristics which support robust detection. The results indicate reliable detection with AUROC exceeding 0.96 in failures in the cabling and screwing task, such as incorrect or misaligned parts and obstructed targets. In the polishing task, only severe failures were reliably detected, while more subtle failure types remained undetected.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures, 4 tables, the paper has been accepted for publication in the IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters</p></details> |
| **[Aurora: Towards Universal Generative Multimodal Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22295v5)** | 2026-02-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cross-domain generalization is very important in Time Series Forecasting because similar historical information may lead to distinct future trends due to the domain-specific characteristics. Recent works focus on building unimodal time series foundation models and end-to-end multimodal supervised models. Since domain-specific knowledge is often contained in modalities like texts, the former lacks the explicit utilization of them, thus hindering the performance. The latter is tailored for end-to-end scenarios and does not support zero-shot inference for cross-domain scenarios. In this work, we introduce Aurora, a Multimodal Time Series Foundation Model, which supports multimodal inputs and zero-shot inference. Pretrained on Cross-domain Multimodal Time Series Corpus, Aurora can adaptively extract and focus on key domain knowledge contained in corresponding text or image modalities, thus possessing strong cross-domain generalization capability. Through tokenization, encoding, and distillation, Aurora can extract multimodal domain knowledge as guidance and then utilizes a Modality-Guided Multi-head Self-Attention to inject them into the modeling of temporal representations. In the decoding phase, the multimodal representations are used to generate the conditions and prototypes of future tokens, contributing to a novel Prototype-Guided Flow Matching for generative probabilistic forecasting. Comprehensive experiments on 5 well-recognized benchmarks, including TimeMMD, TSFM-Bench, ProbTS, TFB, and EPF, demonstrate the consistent state-of-the-art performance of Aurora on both unimodal and multimodal scenarios.</p></details> |  |

We show how intensive, large and accurate time series allow us to see through time. Our Discrete Chi-square Method (DCM) can detect arbitrary trend and signal(-s) combinations. It can forecast complex time series. The widely-used Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) and other frequency-domain parametric time series analysis methods have many application limitations. None of those limitations constrains the DCM. Our simulated time series analyses ascertain the revolutionary Window Dimension Effect (WDE): "For any sample window $ΔT$, DCM inevitably detects the correct $p(t)$ trend and $h(t)$ signal(-s) when the sample size $n$ and/or data accuracy $σ$ increase." The simulations also expose the DFT's weaknesses and the DCM's efficiency. The DCM's backbone is the Gauß-Markov theorem that the Least Squares (LS) is the best unbiased estimator for linear regression models. DCM can not fail because this simple method is based on the computation of a massive number of linear model LS fits. The Fisher-test gives the signal significance estimates and identifies the best DCM model from all alternative tested DCM models. The analytical solution for the non-linear DCM model is an ill-posed problem. We present a computational well-posed solution. The best DCM model must be correct if it passes our Forecast-test.Our DCM is ideal for forecasting because its WDE spearhead is robust against short sample windows and complex time series. In our appendix, we show that the DCM can model and forecast El Nino data between 1870 and 2024. An immediate, independent and objective validity check of our analysis may save some money.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Statistical Approach for Modeling Irregular Multivariate Time Series with Missing Observations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19531v1)** | 2026-02-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Irregular multivariate time series with missing values present significant challenges for predictive modeling in domains such as healthcare. While deep learning approaches often focus on temporal interpolation or complex architectures to handle irregularities, we propose a simpler yet effective alternative: extracting time-agnostic summary statistics to eliminate the temporal axis. Our method computes four key features per variable-mean and standard deviation of observed values, as well as the mean and variability of changes between consecutive observations to create a fixed-dimensional representation. These features are then utilized with standard classifiers, such as logistic regression and XGBoost. Evaluated on four biomedical datasets (PhysioNet Challenge 2012, 2019, PAMAP2, and MIMIC-III), our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing recent transformer and graph-based models by 0.5-1.7% in AUROC/AUPRC and 1.1-1.7% in accuracy/F1-score, while reducing computational complexity. Ablation studies demonstrate that feature extraction-not classifier choice-drives performance gains, and our summary statistics outperform raw/imputed input in most benchmarks. In particular, we identify scenarios where missing patterns themselves encode predictive signals, as in sepsis prediction (PhysioNet, 2019), where missing indicators alone can achieve 94.2% AUROC with XGBoost, only 1.6% lower than using original raw data as input. Our results challenge the necessity of complex temporal modeling when task objectives permit time-agnostic representations, providing an efficient and interpretable solution for irregular time series classification.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in APSIPA Transactions on Signal and Information Processing</p></details> |
| **[Real-time Win Probability and Latent Player Ability via STATS X in Team Sports](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19513v1)** | 2026-02-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study proposes a statistically grounded framework for real-time win probability evaluation and player assessment in score-based team sports, based on minute-by-minute cumulative box-score data. We introduce a continuous dominance indicator (T-score) that maps final scores to real values consistent with win/lose outcomes, and formulate it as a time-evolving stochastic representation (T-process) driven by standardized cumulative statistics. This structure captures temporal game dynamics and enables sequential, analytically tractable updates of in-game win probability. Through this stochastic formulation, competitive advantage is decomposed into interpretable statistical components. Furthermore, we define a latent contribution index, STATS X, which quantifies a player's involvement in favorable dominance intervals identified by the T-process. This allows us to separate a team's baseline strength from game-specific performance fluctuations and provides a coherent, structural evaluation framework for both teams and players. While we do not implement AI methods in this paper, our framework is positioned as a foundational step toward hybrid integration with AI. By providing a structured time-series representation of dominance with an explicit probabilistic interpretation, the framework enables flexible learning mechanisms and incorporation of high-dimensional data, while preserving statistical coherence and interpretability. This work provides a basis for advancing AI-driven sports analytics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Human-Guided Agentic AI for Multimodal Clinical Prediction: Lessons from the AgentDS Healthcare Benchmark](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19502v1)** | 2026-02-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Agentic AI systems are increasingly capable of autonomous data science workflows, yet clinical prediction tasks demand domain expertise that purely automated approaches struggle to provide. We investigate how human guidance of agentic AI can improve multimodal clinical prediction, presenting our approach to all three AgentDS Healthcare benchmark challenges: 30-day hospital readmission prediction (Macro-F1 = 0.8986), emergency department cost forecasting (MAE = $465.13), and discharge readiness assessment (Macro-F1 = 0.7939). Across these tasks, human analysts directed the agentic workflow at key decision points, multimodal feature engineering from clinical notes, scanned PDF billing receipts, and time-series vital signs; task-appropriate model selection; and clinically informed validation strategies. Our approach ranked 5th overall in the healthcare domain, with a 3rd-place finish on the discharge readiness task. Ablation studies reveal that human-guided decisions compounded to a cumulative gain of +0.065 F1 over automated baselines, with multimodal feature extraction contributing the largest single improvement (+0.041 F1). We distill three generalizable lessons: (1) domain-informed feature engineering at each pipeline stage yields compounding gains that outperform extensive automated search; (2) multimodal data integration requires task-specific human judgment that no single extraction strategy generalizes across clinical text, PDFs, and time-series; and (3) deliberate ensemble diversity with clinically motivated model configurations outperforms random hyperparameter search. These findings offer practical guidance for teams deploying agentic AI in healthcare settings where interpretability, reproducibility, and clinical validity are essential.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to the Data Challenge track at the 14th IEEE International Conference on Healthcare Informatics (ICHI) 2026</p></details> |

Conversely, fine-tuned time-series LLMs (TSLMs) understand these patterns but lack the capacity to generalize reasoning for more complicated questions. To bridge this gap, we propose a hybrid knowledge-injection framework that injects TSLM-generated insights directly into GRLM's reasoning trace, thereby achieving strong time-series reasoning with in-domain knowledge. As collecting data for knowledge injection fine-tuning is costly, we further leverage a reinforcement learning-based approach with verifiable rewards (RLVR) to elicit knowledge-rich traces without human supervision, then transfer such an in-domain thinking trace into GRLM for efficient knowledge injection. We further release SenTSR-Bench, a multivariate time-series-based diagnostic reasoning benchmark collected from real-world industrial operations. Across SenTSR-Bench and other public datasets, our method consistently surpasses TSLMs by 9.1%-26.1% and GRLMs by 7.9%-22.4%, delivering robust, context-aware time-series diagnostic insights.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the 29th International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Statistics (AISTATS 2026)</p></details> |

However, this hypothesis has largely been examined in vision and language, and it remains unclear whether time series participate in such convergence. We first examine this in a trimodal setting and find that independently pretrained time series, vision, and language encoders exhibit near-orthogonal geometry in the absence of explicit coupling. We then apply post-hoc alignment by training projection heads over frozen encoders using contrastive learning, and analyze the resulting representations with respect to geometry, scaling behavior, and dependence on information density and input modality characteristics. Our investigation reveals that overall alignment in contrastive representation spaces improves with model size, but this alignment is asymmetric: time series align more strongly with visual representations than with text, and images can act as effective intermediaries between time series and language. We further see that richer textual descriptions improve alignment only up to a threshold; training on denser captions does not lead to further improvement. Analogous effects are observed for visual representations. Our findings shed light on considerations for building multimodal systems involving non-conventional data modalities beyond vision and language.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 Fi...</summary><p>24 Figures, 12 Tables</p></details> |

Whether global warming will continue even in the future, is a question that is most important to investigate. In this regard, the so-called general circulation models (GCMs) have attempted to project the future climate, and nearly all of them exhibit alarming rates of global temperature rise in the future. Although global warming in the current time frame is undeniable, it is important to assess the validity of the future predictions of the GCMs. In this article, we attempt such a study using our recently-developed Bayesian multiple testing paradigm for model selection in inverse regression problems. The model we assume for the global temperature time series is based on Gaussian process emulation of the black box scenario, realistically treating the dynamic evolution of the time series as unknown. We apply our ideas to datasets available from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) website. The best GCM models selected by our method under different assumptions on future climate change scenarios do not convincingly support the present global warming pattern when only the future predictions are considered known. Using our Gaussian process idea, we also forecast the future temperature time series given the current one. Interestingly, our results do not support drastic future global warming predicted by almost all the GCM models.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This updated version will appear in Sankhya B's special issue paying tribute to Professor C.

| **[TimeRadar: A Domain-Rotatable Foundation Model for Time Series Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19068v1)** | 2026-02-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current time series foundation models (TSFMs) primarily focus on learning prevalent and regular patterns within a predefined time or frequency domain to enable supervised downstream tasks (e.g., forecasting). Consequently, they are often ineffective for inherently unsupervised downstream tasks-such as time series anomaly detection (TSAD), which aims to identify rare, irregular patterns. This limitation arises because such abnormal patterns can closely resemble the regular patterns when presented in the same time/frequency domain. To address this issue, we introduce TimeRadar, an innovative TSFM built in a fractional time-frequency domain to support generalist TSAD across diverse unseen datasets. Our key insight is that rotating a time series into a data-dependent fractional time-frequency representation can adaptively differentiate the normal and abnormal signals across different datasets. To this end, a novel component, namely Fractionally modulated Time-Frequency Reconstruction (FTFRecon), is proposed in TimeRadar to leverage a learnable fractional order to rotate the time series to the most pronounced angle between a continuous time and frequency domain for accurate data reconstruction. This provides adaptive data reconstruction in an optimal time-frequency domain for each data input, enabling effective differentiation of the unbounded abnormal patterns from the regular ones across datasets, including unseen datasets. To allow TimeRadar to model local abnormality that is not captured by the global data reconstruction, we further introduce a Contextual Deviation Learning (CDL) component to model the local deviation of the input relative to its contextual time series data in the rotatable domain.</p></details> |  |
| **[Early Multimodal Prediction of Cross-Lingual Meme Virality on Reddit: A Time-Window Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05761v2)** | 2026-02-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Memes are a central part of online culture, yet their virality remains difficult to predict, especially in cross-lingual settings. We present a large-scale, time-series dataset of 46,578 Reddit memes collected from 25 meme-centric subreddits across eight language groups, with more than one million engagement tracking points. We propose a data-driven definition of virality based on a Hybrid Score that normalises engagement by community size and integrates dynamic features such as velocity and acceleration. This approach directly addresses the field's reliance on static, simple volume-based thresholds with arbitrary cut-offs. Building on this target, we construct a multimodal feature set that combines Visual, Textual, Contextual, Network, and Temporal signals, including structured annotations from a multimodal LLM to scale cross-lingual content labelling in a consistent way. We benchmark interpretable baselines (XGBoost, MLP) against end-to-end deep models (BERT, InceptionV3, CLIP) across early observation windows from 30 to 420 minutes. Our best model, a multimodal XGBoost classifier, achieves a PR AUC of 0.43 at 30 minutes and 0.80 at 420 minutes, indicating that early prediction of meme virality is feasible even under strong class imbalance. The results reveal a clear Content Ceiling, where content-only and deep multimodal baselines plateau at low PR AUC, while structural Network and Temporal features are necessary to surpass this limit. A SHAP-based temporal analysis further uncovers an evidentiary transition, where early predictions are dominated by network priors (author and community context), and later predictions increasingly rely on temporal dynamics (velocity, acceleration) as engagement accumulates. Overall, we reframe meme virality as a dynamic, path-dependent process governed by exposure and early interaction patterns rather than by intrinsic content alone.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACM WebSci 2026. 10 pages, 9 fiures and 8 tables</p></details> |

This phenomenon, in-context learning, challenges conventional understanding of learning and adaptation in physical systems. Here, we study in-context learning of dynamical systems in a minimal setting: we train a small two-layer, single-head transformer to forecast one dynamical system, and then evaluate its ability to forecast a different dynamical system without retraining. We discover an early tradeoff in training between in-distribution and out-of-distribution performance, which manifests as a secondary double descent phenomenon. We discover that attention-based models apply a transfer-operator forecasting strategy in-context. They (1) lift low-dimensional time series using delay embedding, to detect the system's higher-dimensional dynamical manifold, and (2) identify and forecast long-lived invariant sets that characterize the global flow on this manifold. Our results clarify the mechanism enabling large pretrained models to forecast unseen physical systems at test without retraining, and they illustrate the unique ability of attention-based models to leverage global attractor information in service of short-term forecasts.</p></details> | 6 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Large Causal Models for Temporal Causal Discovery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18662v1)** | 2026-02-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Causal discovery for both cross-sectional and temporal data has traditionally followed a dataset-specific paradigm, where a new model is fitted for each individual dataset. Such an approach limits the potential of multi-dataset pretraining. The concept of large causal models (LCMs) envisions a class of pre-trained neural architectures specifically designed for temporal causal discovery. Prior approaches are constrained to small variable counts, degrade with larger inputs, and rely heavily on synthetic data, limiting generalization. We propose a principled framework for LCMs, combining diverse synthetic generators with realistic time-series datasets, allowing learning at scale. Extensive experiments on synthetic, semi-synthetic and realistic benchmarks show that LCMs scale effectively to higher variable counts and deeper architectures while maintaining strong performance. Trained models achieve competitive or superior accuracy compared to classical and neural baselines, particularly in out-of-distribution settings, while enabling fast, single-pass inference. Results demonstrate LCMs as a promising foundation-model paradigm for temporal causal discovery.

| **[Adaptive Time Series Reasoning via Segment Selection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18645v1)** | 2026-02-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series reasoning tasks often start with a natural language question and require targeted analysis of a time series. Evidence may span the full series or appear in a few short intervals, so the model must decide what to inspect. Most existing approaches encode the entire time series into a fixed representation before inference, regardless of whether or not the entire sequence is relevant. We introduce ARTIST, which formulates time-series reasoning as a sequential decision problem. ARTIST interleaves reasoning with adaptive temporal segment selection. It adopts a controller-reasoner architecture and uses reinforcement learning to train the controller role to select informative segments and the reasoner role to generate segment-conditioned reasoning traces and final answers. During inference, the model actively acquires task-relevant information instead of relying on a static summary of the full sequence. We use a novel hierarchical policy optimization approach for post-training that allows the model to excel in both segment selection and question-answering behavior. We evaluate ARTIST on six time-series reasoning benchmarks and compare it with large language models, vision-language models, and prior time-series reasoning systems. ARTIST improves average accuracy by 6.46 absolute percentage points over the strongest baseline. The largest gains appear on rare event localization and multi-segment reasoning tasks. Supervised fine-tuning improves performance, and reinforcement learning provides additional gains by optimizing question-adaptive segment selection. These results show that selective data use drives effective time-series reasoning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Robust Time Series Causal Discovery for Agent-Based Model Validation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19412v3)** | 2026-02-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Agent-Based Model (ABM) validation is crucial as it helps ensuring the reliability of simulations, and causal discovery has become a powerful tool in this context. However, current causal discovery methods often face accuracy and robustness challenges when applied to complex and noisy time series data, which is typical in ABM scenarios. This study addresses these issues by proposing a Robust Cross-Validation (RCV) approach to enhance causal structure learning for ABM validation. We develop RCV-VarLiNGAM and RCV-PCMCI, novel extensions of two prominent causal discovery algorithms. These aim to reduce the impact of noise better and give more reliable causal relation results, even with high-dimensional, time-dependent data. The proposed approach is then integrated into an enhanced ABM validation framework, which is designed to handle diverse data and model structures. The approach is evaluated using synthetic datasets and a complex simulated fMRI dataset. The results demonstrate greater reliability in causal structure identification. The study examines how various characteristics of datasets affect the performance of established causal discovery methods. These characteristics include linearity, noise distribution, stationarity, and causal structure density. This analysis is then extended to the RCV method to see how it compares in these different situations. This examination helps confirm whether the results are consistent with existing literature and also reveals the strengths and weaknesses of the novel approaches. By tackling key methodological challenges, the study aims to enhance ABM validation with a more resilient valuation framework presented. These improvements increase the reliability of model-driven decision making processes in complex systems analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>A pee...</summary><p>A peer-reviewed version titled "VCDF: A Validated Consensus-Driven Framework for Time Series Causal Discovery" is accepted to Pacific-Asia Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (PAKDD) 2026.

Here, we consider n-qubit quantum extreme learning machines (QELMs) with continuous-time reservoir dynamics. QELMs are memoryless QRCs capable of various ML tasks, including image classification and time series forecasting. We apply the Pauli transfer matrix (PTM) formalism to theoretically analyze the influence of encoding, reservoir dynamics, and measurement operations, including temporal multiplexing, on the QELM performance. This formalism makes explicit that the encoding determines the complete set of (nonlinear) features available to the QELM, while the quantum channels linearly transform these features before they are probed by the chosen measurement operators. Optimizing a QELM can therefore be cast as a decoding problem in which one shapes the channel-induced transformations such that task-relevant features become available to the regressor. The PTM formalism allows one to identify the classical representation of a QELM and thereby guide its design towards a given training objective. As a specific application, we focus on learning nonlinear dynamical systems and show that a QELM trained on such trajectories learns a surrogate-approximation to the underlying flow map.</p></details> | 34 pages, 12 figures |

We develop and apply Bayesian Dirichlet autoregressive moving average (BDARMA) models to forecast the compositional dynamics of guest origin market shares using proprietary Airbnb booking data spanning 2017--2024 across four major destination regions. Our analysis reveals substantial pandemic-induced structural breaks in origin composition, with heterogeneous recovery patterns across markets. The BDARMA framework achieves the lowest average forecast error across all destination regions, outperforming standard benchmarks including naïve forecasts, exponential smoothing, and SARIMA on log-ratio transformed data. For EMEA destinations, BDARMA achieves 23% lower forecast error than naive methods, with statistically significant improvements. By modeling compositions directly on the simplex with a Dirichlet likelihood and incorporating seasonal variation in both mean and precision parameters, our approach produces coherent forecasts that respect the unit-sum constraint while capturing complex temporal dependencies. The methodology provides destination stakeholders with probabilistic forecasts of source market shares, enabling more informed strategic planning for marketing resource allocation, infrastructure investment, and crisis response.</p></details> |  |

Understanding and decoding cognitive brain states from fMRI depends on how functional interactions are represented. We propose an ensemble-based graph representation in which each edge weight encodes state evidence as the difference between posterior probabilities of two states, estimated by an ensemble of edge-wise probabilistic classifiers from simple pairwise time-series features. We evaluate the method on seven task-fMRI paradigms from the Human Connectome Project, performing binary classification within each paradigm. Using compact node summaries (mean incident edge weights) and logistic regression, we obtain average accuracies of 97.07-99.74 %. We further compare ensemble graphs with conventional correlation graphs using the same graph neural network classifier; ensemble graphs consistently yield higher accuracy (88.00-99.42 % vs 61.86-97.94 % across tasks). Because edge weights have a probabilistic, state-oriented interpretation, the representation supports connection- and region-level interpretability and can be extended to multiclass decoding, regression, other neuroimaging modalities, and clinical classification.</p></details> |  |

Building on theoretical considerations and empirical stylized facts, our approach utilizes a Poisson random walk model that allows for heavy-tailed innovations or stochastic volatility dynamics, while incorporating an explicit mechanism to separate structural from sampling zeros. Posterior inference is carried out via a straightforward Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm. Applying this methodology to the Mediterranean and English Channel data, we compare alternative model specifications through a comprehensive out-of-sample density forecasting exercise. Evaluating each model using log predictive scores and empirical coverage up to the 99th percentile, we find strong evidence for stochastic volatility in the migration innovations, with these models producing well-calibrated forecasts even at extreme quantiles. Our framework can be used to develop risk indicators with direct policy implications for improving governance and preparedness for migration surges. More broadly, the methodology extends to other zero-inflated non-stationary count time series applications, including epidemiological surveillance and public safety incident monitoring.</p></details> |  |

Although early models such as Mantis have shown the promise of this approach, a substantial performance gap remained between frozen and fine-tuned encoders. In this work, we introduce methods that significantly strengthen zero-shot feature extraction for time series. First, we introduce Mantis+, a variant of Mantis pre-trained entirely on synthetic time series. Second, through controlled ablation studies, we refine the architecture and obtain MantisV2, an improved and more lightweight encoder. Third, we propose an enhanced test-time methodology that leverages intermediate-layer representations and refines output-token aggregation. In addition, we show that performance can be further improved via self-ensembling and cross-model embedding fusion. Extensive experiments on UCR, UEA, Human Activity Recognition (HAR) benchmarks, and EEG datasets show that MantisV2 and Mantis+ consistently outperform prior time series foundation models, achieving state-of-the-art zero-shot performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Financial time series augmentation using transformer based GAN architecture](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17865v1)** | 2026-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time-series forecasting is a critical task across many domains, from engineering to economics, where accurate predictions drive strategic decisions. However, applying advanced deep learning models in challenging, volatile domains like finance is difficult due to the inherent limitation and dynamic nature of financial time series data. This scarcity often results in sub-optimal model training and poor generalization. The fundamental challenge lies in determining how to reliably augment scarce financial time series data to enhance the predictive accuracy of deep learning forecasting models. Our main contribution is a demonstration of how Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) can effectively serve as a data augmentation tool to overcome data scarcity in the financial domain. Specifically, we show that training a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) forecasting model on a dataset augmented with synthetic data generated by a transformer-based GAN (TTS-GAN) significantly improves the forecasting accuracy compared to using real data alone. We confirm these results across different financial time series (Bitcoin and S\&P500 price data) and various forecasting horizons. Furthermore, we propose a novel, time series specific quality metric that combines Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and a modified Deep Dataset Dissimilarity Measure (DeD-iMs) to reliably monitor the training progress and evaluate the quality of the generated data. These findings provide compelling evidence for the benefits of GAN-based data augmentation in enhancing financial predictive capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted for the upcoming 18th International Conference on Agents and Artificial Intelligence (ICAART-2026), Marbella, Spain.

| **[Individualized and Interpretable Sleep Forecasting via a Two-Stage Adaptive Spatial-Temporal Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06974v2)** | 2026-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sleep quality impacts well-being. Therefore, healthcare providers and individuals need accessible and reliable forecasting tools for preventive interventions. This paper introduces an interpretable, individualized adaptive spatial-temporal model for predicting sleep quality. We designed a hierarchical architecture, consisting of parallel 1D convolutions with varying kernel sizes and dilated convolution, which extracts multi-resolution temporal patterns-short kernels capture rapid physiological changes, while larger kernels and dilation model slower trends. The extracted features are then refined through channel attention, which learns to emphasize the most predictive variables for each individual, followed by bidirectional LSTM and self-attention that jointly model both local sequential dynamics and global temporal dependencies. Finally, a two-stage adaptation strategy ensures the learned representations transfer effectively to new users. We conducted various experiments with five input window sizes (3, 5, 7, 9, and 11 days) and five prediction window sizes (1, 3, 5, 7, and 9 days). Our model consistently outperformed time series forecasting baseline approaches, including LSTM, Informer, PatchTST, and TimesNet. The best performance was achieved with a three-day input window and a one-day prediction window, yielding an RMSE of 0.216. Furthermore, the model demonstrated good predictive performance even for longer forecasting horizons (e.g., with a 0.257 RMSE for a three-day prediction window), highlighting its practical utility for real-world applications. We also conducted an explainability analysis to examine how different features influence sleep quality. These findings proved that the proposed framework offers a robust, adaptive, and explainable solution for personalized sleep forecasting using sparse data from commercial wearable devices.</p></details> |  |
| **[AdaptStress: Online Adaptive Learning for Interpretable and Personalized Stress Prediction Using Multivariate and Sparse Physiological Signals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18521v1)** | 2026-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Continuous stress forecasting could potentially contribute to lifestyle interventions. This paper presents a novel, explainable, and individualized approach for stress prediction using physiological data from consumer-grade smartwatches. We develop a time series forecasting model that leverages multivariate features, including heart rate variability, activity patterns, and sleep metrics, to predict stress levels across 16 temporal horizons (History window: 3, 5, 7, 9 days; forecasting window: 1, 3, 5, 7 days). Our evaluation involves 16 participants monitored for 10-15 weeks. We evaluate our approach across 16 participants, comparing against state-of-the-art time series models (Informer, TimesNet, PatchTST) and traditional baselines (CNN, LSTM, CNN-LSTM) across multiple temporal horizons. Our model achieved performance with an MSE of 0.053, MAE of 0.190, and RMSE of 0.226 in optimal settings (5-day input, 1-day prediction). A comparison with the baseline models shows that our model outperforms TimesNet, PatchTST, CNN-LSTM, LSTM, and CNN under all conditions, representing improvements of 36.9%, 25.5%, and 21.5% over the best baseline. According to the explanability analysis, sleep metrics are the most dominant and consistent stress predictors (importance: 1.1, consistency: 0.9-1.0), while activity features exhibit high inter-participant variability (0.1-0.2). Most notably, the model captures individual-specific patterns where identical features can have opposing effects across users, validating its personalization capabilities. These findings establish that consumer wearables, combined with adaptive and interpretable deep learning, can deliver relevant stress assessment adapted to individual physiological responses, providing a foundation for scalable, continuous, explainable mental health monitoring in real-world settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Causality by Abstraction: Symbolic Rule Learning in Multivariate Timeseries with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17829v1)** | 2026-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inferring causal relations in timeseries data with delayed effects is a fundamental challenge, especially when the underlying system exhibits complex dynamics that cannot be captured by simple functional mappings. Traditional approaches often fail to produce generalized and interpretable explanations, as multiple distinct input trajectories may yield nearly indistinguishable outputs. In this work, we present ruleXplain, a framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to extract formal explanations for input-output relations in simulation-driven dynamical systems. Our method introduces a constrained symbolic rule language with temporal operators and delay semantics, enabling LLMs to generate verifiable causal rules through structured prompting. ruleXplain relies on the availability of a principled model (e.g., a simulator) that maps multivariate input time series to output time series. Within ruleXplain, the simulator is used to generate diverse counterfactual input trajectories that yield similar target output, serving as candidate explanations. Such counterfactual inputs are clustered and provided as context to the LLM, which is tasked with the generation of symbolic rules encoding the joint temporal trends responsible for the patterns observable in the output times series. A closed-loop refinement process ensures rule consistency and semantic validity. We validate the framework using the PySIRTEM epidemic simulator, mapping testing rate inputs to daily infection counts; and the EnergyPlus building energy simulator, observing temperature and solar irradiance inputs to electricity needs. For validation, we perform three classes of experiments: (1) the efficacy of the ruleset through input reconstruction; (2) ablation studies evaluating the causal encoding of the ruleset; and (3) generalization tests of the extracted rules across unseen output trends with varying phase dynamics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reverso: Efficient Time Series Foundation Models for Zero-shot Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17634v1)** | 2026-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning time series foundation models has been shown to be a promising approach for zero-shot time series forecasting across diverse time series domains. Insofar as scaling has been a critical driver of performance of foundation models in other modalities such as language and vision, much recent work on time series foundation modeling has focused on scaling. This has resulted in time series foundation models with hundreds of millions of parameters that are, while performant, inefficient and expensive to use in practice. This paper describes a simple recipe for learning efficient foundation models for zero-shot time series forecasting that are orders of magnitude smaller. We show that large-scale transformers are not necessary: small hybrid models that interleave long convolution and linear RNN layers (in particular DeltaNet layers) can match the performance of larger transformer-based models while being more than a hundred times smaller. We also describe several data augmentation and inference strategies that further improve performance. This recipe results in Reverso, a family of efficient time series foundation models for zero-shot forecasting that significantly push the performance-efficiency Pareto frontier.</p></details> |  |
| **[Be Wary of Your Time Series Preprocessing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17568v1)** | 2026-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Normalization and scaling are fundamental preprocessing steps in time series modeling, yet their role in Transformer-based models remains underexplored from a theoretical perspective. In this work, we present the first formal analysis of how different normalization strategies, specifically instance-based and global scaling, impact the expressivity of Transformer-based architectures for time series representation learning. We propose a novel expressivity framework tailored to time series, which quantifies a model's ability to distinguish between similar and dissimilar inputs in the representation space. Using this framework, we derive theoretical bounds for two widely used normalization methods: Standard and Min-Max scaling. Our analysis reveals that the choice of normalization strategy can significantly influence the model's representational capacity, depending on the task and data characteristics. We complement our theory with empirical validation on classification and forecasting benchmarks using multiple Transformer-based models. Our results show that no single normalization method consistently outperforms others, and in some cases, omitting normalization entirely leads to superior performance. These findings highlight the critical role of preprocessing in time series learning and motivate the need for more principled normalization strategies tailored to specific tasks and datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the AI4TS workshop at AAAI-26</p></details> |
| **[An extension to reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo for change point problems with heterogeneous temporal dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17503v1)** | 2026-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Detecting brief changes in time-series data remains a major challenge in fields where short-lived states carry meaning. In single-molecule localisation microscopy, this problem is particularly acute as fluorescent molecules used to tag protein oligomers display heterogenous photophysical behaviour that can complicate photobleach step analysis; a key step in resolving nanoscale protein organisation. Existing methods often require extensive filtering or prior calibration, and can fail to accurately account for blinking or reversible dark states that may contaminate downstream analysis. In this paper, an extension to RJMCMC is proposed for change point detection with heterogeneous temporal dynamics. This approach is applied to the problem of estimating per-frame active fluorophore counts from one-dimensional integrated intensity traces derived from Fluorescence Localisation Imaging with Photobleaching (FLImP), where compound change point pair moves are introduced to better account for short-lived events known as blinking and dark states. The approach is validated using simulated and experimental data, demonstrating improved accuracy and robustness when compared with current photobleach step analysis methods and with the existing analysis approach for FLImP data. This Compound RJMCMC (CRJMCMC) algorithm performs reliably across a wide range of fluorophore counts and signal-to-noise conditions, with signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) down to 0.001 and counts as high as seventeen fluorophores, while also effectively estimating low counts observed when studying EGFR oligomerisation. Beyond single molecule imaging, this work has applications for a variety of time series change point detection problems with heterogeneous state persistence. For example, electrocorticography brain-state segmentation, fault detection in industrial process monitoring and realised volatility in financial time series.</p></details> |  |
| **[Self-Normalization for CUSUM-based Change Detection in Locally Stationary Time Series](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07112v2)** | 2026-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A new self-normalized CUSUM test is proposed for detecting changes in the mean of a locally stationary time series. For stationary data, self-normalization relies on the factorization of a constant long-run variance and a stochastic factor. In this case, the CUSUM statistic can be divided by another statistic proportional to the long-run variance, so that the latter cancels, avoiding estimation of the long-run variance. Under local stationarity, the partial sum process converges to $\int_0^t σ(x) d B_x$ and no such factorization is possible. To overcome this obstacle, a self-normalized test statistic is introduced, based on a bivariate partial-sum process. Weak convergence of the process is proven, and it is shown that the resulting self-normalized test attains asymptotic level $α$ under the null hypothesis of no change, while being consistent against abrupt, gradual, and multiple changes under mild assumptions. Simulation studies show that the proposed test has accurate size and substantially improved finite-sample power relative to existing approaches. Two data examples illustrate practical performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Keywo...</summary><p>Keywords: Change point analysis, gradual changes, local stationarity, self-normalization, CUSUM test</p></details> |
| **[Time-Varyingness in Auction Breaks Revenue Equivalence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12306v2)** | 2026-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Auction is applied for trade with various mechanisms. A simple but practical question is which mechanism, typically first-price or second-price auctions, is preferred from the perspective of bidders or sellers. A celebrated answer is revenue equivalence, where each bidder's equilibrium payoff is proven to be independent of auction mechanisms (and a seller's revenue, too). In reality, however, auction environments like the value distribution of items would vary over time, and such equilibrium bidding cannot always be achieved. Indeed, bidders must continue to track their equilibrium bidding by learning in first-price auctions, but they can keep their equilibrium bidding in second-price auctions. This study discusses whether and how revenue equivalence is violated in the long run by comparing the time series of non-equilibrium bidding in first-price auctions with those of equilibrium bidding in second-price auctions. We characterize the value distribution by two parameters: its basis value, which means the lowest price to bid, and its value interval, which means the width of possible values. Surprisingly, our theorems and experiments find that revenue equivalence is broken by the correlation between the basis value and the value interval, uncovering a novel phenomenon that could occur in the real world.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 4 figures (main); 6 pages, 1 figure (appendix)</p></details> |

The objective of the paper is to analyse the impact of economic policies on wealth distribution in the Bitcoin ecosystem. Different macroeconomic and microeconomic time series are used to eliminate noise in the wealth distribution time series, and the causality analysis is performed between Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (i.e., BIPs) and the cleaned wealth distribution data to reveal possible patterns in the impacts that the endogenous policies have on wealth distribution in token economies. Lastly, a structure for economic policy taxonomy in token economies is proposed where different the policy implementations are illustrated by existing BIPs. This approach highlights the actions available to the policy makers, as well as providing a technique for analysis of policy impacts in token economies and their categorization.</p></details> | <details><summary>34 pa...</summary><p>34 pages, 10 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |

To address this within standard deep learning benchmark settings, we propose the Hierarchical Patching Mixer (HPMixer), which models periodicity and residuals in a decoupled yet complementary manner. The periodic component utilizes a learnable cycle module [7] enhanced with a nonlinear channel-wise MLP for greater expressiveness. The residual component is processed through a Learnable Stationary Wavelet Transform (LSWT) to extract stable, shift-invariant frequency-domain representations. Subsequently, a channel-mixing encoder models explicit inter-channel dependencies, while a two-level non-overlapping hierarchical patching mechanism captures coarse- and fine-scale residual variations. By integrating decoupled periodicity modeling with structured, multi-scale residual learning, HPMixer provides an effective framework. Extensive experiments on standard multivariate benchmarks demonstrate that HPMixer achieves competitive or state-of-the-art performance compared to recent baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 5 figures, 5 tables, PAKDD 2026</p></details> |

The approach is inspired by recent advances in focused inference and model selection techniques. The paper generalises and extends recent work by developing a new version of the focused information criterion (FIC), directly comparing the performance of parametric time series models with a nonparametric alternative. For a pre-specified focused parameter, for which scrutiny is considered valuable, this is achieved by comparing the mean squared error of the model-based estimators of this quantity. In particular, this yields FIC formulae for covariances or correlations at specified lags, for the probability of reaching a threshold, etc. Suitable weighted average versions, the AFIC, also lead to model selection strategies for finding the best model for the purpose of estimating e.g.~a sequence of correlations.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 6 figures; Statistical Research Report (Department of Mathematics, University of Oslo), from December 2015, but arXiv'd February 2026; a later modified and extended version might then become a journal paper</p></details> |
| **[MGD: Moment Guided Diffusion for Maximum Entropy Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17211v1)** | 2026-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating samples from limited information is a fundamental problem across scientific domains. Classical maximum entropy methods provide principled uncertainty quantification from moment constraints but require sampling via MCMC or Langevin dynamics, which typically exhibit exponential slowdown in high dimensions. In contrast, generative models based on diffusion and flow matching efficiently transport noise to data but offer limited theoretical guarantees and can overfit when data is scarce. We introduce Moment Guided Diffusion (MGD), which combines elements of both approaches. Building on the stochastic interpolant framework, MGD samples maximum entropy distributions by solving a stochastic differential equation that guides moments toward prescribed values in finite time, thereby avoiding slow mixing in equilibrium-based methods. We formally obtain, in the large-volatility limit, convergence of MGD to the maximum entropy distribution and derive a tractable estimator of the resulting entropy computed directly from the dynamics. Applications to financial time series, turbulent flows, and cosmological fields using wavelet scattering moments yield estimates of negentropy for high-dimensional multiscale processes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exploring Memory Effects: Sparse Identification in Vector-Borne Diseases](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20591v2)** | 2026-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predicting the human burden of vector-borne diseases from limited surveillance data remains a major challenge, particularly in the presence of nonlinear transmission dynamics and delayed effects arising from vector ecology and human behavior. We develop a data-driven framework based on an extension of Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy) to systems with distributed memory, enabling discovery of transmission mechanisms directly from time series data. Using severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) as a case study, we show that this approach can uncover key features of tick-borne disease dynamics using only human incidence and local temperature data, without imposing predefined assumptions on human case reporting. We further demonstrate that predictive performance is substantially enhanced when the data-driven model is coupled with mechanistic representations of tick-host transmission pathways informed by empirical studies. The framework supports systematic sensitivity analysis of memory kernels and behavioral parameters, identifying those most influential for prediction accuracy. Although the approach prioritizes predictive accuracy over mechanistic transparency, it yields sparse, interpretable integral representations suitable for epidemiological forecasting. This hybrid methodology provides a scalable strategy for forecasting vector-borne disease risk and informing public health decision-making under data limitations.</p></details> |  |
| **[TimeOmni-VL: Unified Models for Time Series Understanding and Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17149v1)** | 2026-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent time series modeling faces a sharp divide between numerical generation and semantic understanding, with research showing that generation models often rely on superficial pattern matching, while understanding-oriented models struggle with high-fidelity numerical output. Although unified multimodal models (UMMs) have bridged this gap in vision, their potential for time series remains untapped. We propose TimeOmni-VL, the first vision-centric framework that unifies time series understanding and generation through two key innovations: (1) Fidelity-preserving bidirectional mapping between time series and images (Bi-TSI), which advances Time Series-to-Image (TS2I) and Image-to-Time Series (I2TS) conversions to ensure near-lossless transformations. (2) Understanding-guided generation. We introduce TSUMM-Suite, a novel dataset consists of six understanding tasks rooted in time series analytics that are coupled with two generation tasks. With a calibrated Chain-of-Thought, TimeOmni-VL is the first to leverage time series understanding as an explicit control signal for high-fidelity generation. Experiments confirm that this unified approach significantly improves both semantic understanding and numerical precision, establishing a new frontier for multimodal time series modeling.</p></details> |  |
| **[TIFO: Time-Invariant Frequency Operator for Stationarity-Aware Representation Learning in Time Series](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17122v1)** | 2026-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Nonstationary time series forecasting suffers from the distribution shift issue due to the different distributions that produce the training and test data. Existing methods attempt to alleviate the dependence by, e.g., removing low-order moments from each individual sample. These solutions fail to capture the underlying time-evolving structure across samples and do not model the complex time structure. In this paper, we aim to address the distribution shift in the frequency space by considering all possible time structures. To this end, we propose a Time-Invariant Frequency Operator (TIFO), which learns stationarity-aware weights over the frequency spectrum across the entire dataset. The weight representation highlights stationary frequency components while suppressing non-stationary ones, thereby mitigating the distribution shift issue in time series. To justify our method, we show that the Fourier transform of time series data implicitly induces eigen-decomposition in the frequency space. TIFO is a plug-and-play approach that can be seamlessly integrated into various forecasting models. Experiments demonstrate our method achieves 18 top-1 and 6 top-2 results out of 28 forecasting settings. Notably, it yields 33.3% and 55.3% improvements in average MSE on the ETTm2 dataset. In addition, TIFO reduces computational costs by 60% -70% compared to baseline methods, demonstrating strong scalability across diverse forecasting models.</p></details> |  |

Portfolio optimization is a key component that involves allocating the portfolio assets so as to maximize returns while minimizing risk taken. It is typically carried out by financial professionals who use a combination of quantitative techniques and investment expertise to make decisions about the portfolio allocation. Recent applications of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) have shown promising results when used to optimize portfolio allocation by training model-free agents on historical market data. Many of these methods compare their results against basic benchmarks or other state-of-the-art DRL agents but often fail to compare their performance against traditional methods used by financial professionals in practical settings. One of the most commonly used methods for this task is Mean-Variance Portfolio Optimization (MVO), which uses historical time series information to estimate expected asset returns and covariances, which are then used to optimize for an investment objective. Our work is a thorough comparison between model-free DRL and MVO for optimal portfolio allocation. We detail the specifics of how to make DRL for portfolio optimization work in practice, also noting the adjustments needed for MVO. Backtest results demonstrate strong performance of the DRL agent across many metrics, including Sharpe ratio, maximum drawdowns, and absolute returns.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 6 figures.

However, most existing methods are reactive: they detect anomalies only after they occur and lack the capability to provide proactive early warning signals. In this paper, we propose FATE (Forecasting Anomalies with Time-series Ensembles), a novel unsupervised framework for detecting Precursors-of-Anomaly (PoA) by quantifying predictive uncertainty from a diverse ensemble of time-series forecasting models. Unlike prior approaches that rely on reconstruction errors or require ground-truth labels, FATE anticipates future values and leverages ensemble disagreement to signal early signs of potential anomalies without access to target values at inference time. To rigorously evaluate PoA detection, we introduce Precursor Time-series Aware Precision and Recall (PTaPR), a new metric that extends the traditional Time-series Aware Precision and Recall (TaPR) by jointly assessing segment-level accuracy, within-segment coverage, and temporal promptness of early predictions. This enables a more holistic assessment of early warning capabilities that existing metrics overlook. Experiments on five real-world benchmark datasets show that FATE achieves an average improvement of 19.9 percentage points in PTaPR AUC and 20.02 percentage points in early detection F1 score, outperforming baselines while requiring no anomaly labels. These results demonstrate the effectiveness and practicality of FATE for real-time unsupervised early warning in complex time-series environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This manuscript contains 14 pages and 8 figures.

However, existing Text-to-SQL methods are not designed for continuous morphological intents such as shapes or anomalies, while time series models struggle to handle ultra-long histories. To address these challenges, we propose Sonar-TS, a neuro-symbolic framework that tackles NLQ4TSDB via a Search-Then-Verify pipeline. Analogous to active sonar, it utilizes a feature index to ping candidate windows via SQL, followed by generated Python programs to lock on and verify candidates against raw signals. To enable effective evaluation, we introduce NLQTSBench, the first large-scale benchmark designed for NLQ over TSDB-scale histories. Our experiments highlight the unique challenges within this domain and demonstrate that Sonar-TS effectively navigates complex temporal queries where traditional methods fail. This work presents the first systematic study of NLQ4TSDB, offering a general framework and evaluation standard to facilitate future research.</p></details> |  |

With a lot of hype and industrial demand in this field, it is not always clear how much progress there really is. To advance TS forecasting and analysis to the next level, here we argue that the field needs a dynamical systems (DS) perspective. TS of observations from natural or engineered systems almost always originate from some underlying DS, and arguably access to its governing equations would yield theoretically optimal forecasts. This is the promise of DS reconstruction (DSR), a class of ML/AI approaches that aim to infer surrogate models of the underlying DS from data. But models based on DS principles offer other profound advantages: Beyond short-term forecasts, they enable to predict the long-term statistics of an observed system, which in many practical scenarios may be the more relevant quantities. DS theory furthermore provides domain-independent theoretical insight into mechanisms underlying TS generation, and thereby will inform us, e.g., about upper bounds on performance of any TS model, generalization into unseen regimes as in tipping points, or potential control strategies. After reviewing some of the central concepts, methods, measures, and models in DS theory and DSR, we will discuss how insights from this field can advance TS modeling in crucial ways, enabling better forecasting with much lower computational and memory footprints. We conclude with a number of specific suggestions for translating insights from DSR into TS modeling.</p></details> |  |

The key challenge is twofold: (i) predict multiple plausible ego intentions according to context and (ii) for each intention, predict the joint responses of surrounding agents, enabling effective what-if decision-making. However, existing methods often fall short, typically treating these interdependent problems in isolation. We propose ParkDiffusion++, which jointly learns a multi-modal ego intention predictor and an ego-conditioned multi-agent joint trajectory predictor for automated parking. Our approach makes several key contributions. First, we introduce an ego intention tokenizer that predicts a small set of discrete endpoint intentions from agent histories and vectorized map polylines. Second, we perform ego-intention-conditioned joint prediction, yielding socially consistent predictions of the surrounding agents for each possible ego intention. Third, we employ a lightweight safety-guided denoiser with different constraints to refine joint scenes during training, thus improving accuracy and safety. Fourth, we propose counterfactual knowledge distillation, where an EMA teacher refined by a frozen safety-guided denoiser provides pseudo-targets that capture how agents react to alternative ego intentions.

| **[Trajectory-aware Shifted State Space Models for Online Video Super-Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10453v2)** | 2026-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Online video super-resolution (VSR) is an important technique for many real-world video processing applications, which aims to restore the current high-resolution video frame based on temporally previous frames. Most of the existing online VSR methods solely employ one neighboring previous frame to achieve temporal alignment, which limits long-range temporal modeling of videos. Recently, state space models (SSMs) have been proposed with linear computational complexity and a global receptive field, which significantly improve computational efficiency and performance. In this context, this paper presents a novel online VSR method based on Trajectory-aware Shifted SSMs (TS-Mamba), leveraging both long-term trajectory modeling and low-complexity Mamba to achieve efficient spatio-temporal information aggregation. Specifically, TS-Mamba first constructs the trajectories within a video to select the most similar tokens from the previous frames. Then, a Trajectory-aware Shifted Mamba Aggregation (TSMA) module consisting of proposed shifted SSMs blocks is employed to aggregate the selected tokens. The shifted SSMs blocks are designed based on Hilbert scannings and corresponding shift operations to compensate for scanning losses and strengthen the spatial continuity of Mamba. Additionally, we propose a trajectory-aware loss function to supervise the trajectory generation, ensuring the accuracy of token selection when training our model. Extensive experiments on three widely used VSR test datasets demonstrate that compared with six online VSR benchmark models, our TS-Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance in most cases and over 22.7% complexity reduction (in MACs).</p></details> | ICLR2026 |

This research introduces a transformative framework for generating large-scale urban mobility trajectories, employing a novel application of a transformer-based model pre-trained and fine-tuned through a two-phase process. Initially, trajectory generation is conceptualized as an offline reinforcement learning (RL) problem, with a significant reduction in vocabulary space achieved during tokenization. The integration of Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) allows for the capture of trajectory-wise reward signals, leveraging historical data to infer individual mobility preferences. Subsequently, the pre-trained model is fine-tuned using the constructed reward model, effectively addressing the challenges inherent in traditional RL-based autoregressive methods, such as long-term credit assignment and handling of sparse reward environments. Comprehensive evaluations on multiple datasets illustrate that our framework markedly surpasses existing models in terms of reliability and diversity. Our findings not only advance the field of urban mobility modeling but also provide a robust methodology for simulating urban data, with significant implications for traffic management and urban development planning. The implementation is publicly available at https://github.com/Wangjw6/TrajGPT_R.</p></details> | <details><summary>TrajG...</summary><p>TrajGPT-R is a Reinforcement Learning-Enhanced Generative Pre-trained Transformer for Mobility Trajectory Generation</p></details> |

However, current approaches focus predominantly on global image understanding, struggling to simulate human visual attention trajectories and explain associations between descriptions and specific regions. We propose TraceVision, a unified vision-language model integrating trajectory-aware spatial understanding in an end-to-end framework. TraceVision employs a Trajectory-aware Visual Perception (TVP) module for bidirectional fusion of visual features and trajectory information. We design geometric simplification to extract semantic keypoints from raw trajectories and propose a three-stage training pipeline where trajectories guide description generation and region localization. We extend TraceVision to trajectory-guided segmentation and video scene understanding, enabling cross-frame tracking and temporal attention analysis. We construct the Reasoning-based Interactive Localized Narratives (RILN) dataset to enhance logical reasoning and interpretability. Extensive experiments on trajectory-guided captioning, text-guided trajectory prediction, understanding, and segmentation demonstrate that TraceVision achieves state-of-the-art performance, establishing a foundation for intuitive spatial interaction and interpretable visual understanding.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Efficient LiDAR-Camera Fusion Network for Multi-Class 3D Dynamic Object Detection and Trajectory Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13647v2)** | 2026-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Service mobile robots are often required to avoid dynamic objects while performing their tasks, but they usually have only limited computational resources. To further advance the practical application of service robots in complex dynamic environments, we propose an efficient multi-modal framework for 3D object detection and trajectory prediction, which synergistically integrates LiDAR and camera inputs to achieve real-time perception of pedestrians, vehicles, and riders in 3D space.The framework incorporates two novel models: 1) a Unified modality detector with Mamba and Transformer (UniMT) for object detection, which achieves high-accuracy object detection with fast inference speed, and 2) a Reference Trajectory-based Multi-Class Transformer (RTMCT) for efficient and diverse trajectory prediction of multi-class objects with flexible-length trajectories. Evaluations on the CODa benchmark demonstrate that our method outperforms existing ones in both detection (+3.71\% in mAP) and trajectory prediction (-0.408m in minADE$_5$ of pedestrians) metrics. Furthermore, on the challenging nuScenes detection benchmark, our detection model achieves competitive performance among LiDAR-camera fusion methods, with a mAP of 72.7\% and NDS of 75.3\%. Remarkably, the system demonstrates exceptional generalizability and practical deployment potential. When transferred and implemented on a wheelchair robot with an entry-level NVIDIA RTX 3060 GPU, it achieves real-time inference at 13.9 frames per second (FPS) with satisfactory accuracy. To facilitate reproducibility and practical deployment, we release the related code of the method at \href{https://github.com/TossherO/3D_Perception}{https://github.com/TossherO/3D\_Perception} and its ROS inference version at \href{https://github.com/TossherO/ros_packages}{https://github.com/TossherO/ros\_packages}.</p></details> |  |
| **[Time-varying Vector Field Compression with Preserved Critical Point Trajectories](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25143v2)** | 2026-02-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scientific simulations and observations are producing vast amounts of time-varying vector field data, making it hard to store them for archival purposes and transmit them for analysis. Lossy compression is considered a promising approach to reducing these data because lossless compression yields low compression ratios that barely mitigate the problem. However, directly applying existing lossy compression methods to timevarying vector fields may introduce undesired distortions in critical-point trajectories, a crucial feature that encodes key properties of the vector field. In this work, we propose an efficient lossy compression framework that exactly preserves all critical-point trajectories in time-varying vector fields. Our contributions are threefold. First, we extend the theory for preserving critical points in space to preserving critical-point trajectories in space-time, and develop a compression framework to realize the functionality. Second, we propose a semi-Lagrange predictor to exploit the spatiotemporal correlations in advectiondominated regions, and combine it with the traditional Lorenzo predictor for improved compression efficiency. Third, we evaluate our method against state-of-the-art lossy and lossless compressors using four real-world scientific datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method delivers up to 124.48X compression ratios while effectively preserving all critical-point trajectories. This compression ratio is up to 56.07X higher than that of the best lossless compressors, and none of the existing lossy compressors can preserve all critical-point trajectories at similar compression ratios.</p></details> |  |

Recent studies demonstrate that anchor-guided generative models are effective in modeling the uncertainty of driving behaviors and improving overall performance. However, these methods rely on discrete anchor vocabularies that must sufficiently cover the trajectory distribution during testing to ensure robustness, inducing an inherent trade-off between vocabulary size and model performance. To overcome this limitation, we propose MeanFuser, an end-to-end autonomous driving method that enhances both efficiency and robustness through three key designs. (1) We introduce Gaussian Mixture Noise (GMN) to guide generative sampling, enabling a continuous representation of the trajectory space and eliminating the dependency on discrete anchor vocabularies. (2) We adapt ``MeanFlow Identity" to end-to-end planning, which models the mean velocity field between GMN and trajectory distribution instead of the instantaneous velocity field used in vanilla flow matching methods, effectively eliminating numerical errors from ODE solvers and significantly accelerating inference. (3) We design a lightweight Adaptive Reconstruction Module (ARM) that enables the model to implicitly select from all sampled proposals or reconstruct a new trajectory when none is satisfactory via attention weights. Experiments on the NAVSIM closed-loop benchmark demonstrate that MeanFuser achieves outstanding performance without the supervision of the PDM Score. and exceptional inference efficiency, offering a robust and efficient solution for end-to-end autonomous driving. Our code and model are available at https://github.com/wjl2244/MeanFuser.</p></details> |  |
| **[FACTO: Function-space Adaptive Constrained Trajectory Optimization for Robotic Manipulators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20225v1)** | 2026-02-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces Function-space Adaptive Constrained Trajectory Optimization (FACTO), a new trajectory optimization algorithm for both single- and multi-arm manipulators. Trajectory representations are parameterized as linear combinations of orthogonal basis functions, and optimization is performed directly in the coefficient space. The constrained problem formulation consists of both an objective functional and a finite-dimensional objective defined over truncated coefficients. To address nonlinearity, FACTO uses a Gauss-Newton approximation with exponential moving averaging, yielding a smoothed quadratic subproblem. Trajectory-wide constraints are addressed using coefficient-space mappings, and an adaptive constrained update using the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm is performed in the null space of active constraints. Comparisons with optimization-based planners (CHOMP, TrajOpt, GPMP2) and sampling-based planners (RRT-Connect, RRT*, PRM) show the improved solution quality and feasibility, especially in constrained single- and multi-arm scenarios. The experimental evaluation of FACTO on Franka robots verifies the feasibility of deployment.</p></details> |  |
| **[CACTO-BIC: Scalable Actor-Critic Learning via Biased Sampling and GPU-Accelerated Trajectory Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19699v1)** | 2026-02-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory Optimization (TO) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) offer complementary strengths for solving optimal control problems. TO efficiently computes locally optimal solutions but can struggle with non-convexity, while RL is more robust to non-convexity at the cost of significantly higher computational demands. CACTO (Continuous Actor-Critic with Trajectory Optimization) was introduced to combine these advantages by learning a warm-start policy that guides the TO solver towards low-cost trajectories. However, scalability remains a key limitation, as increasing system complexity significantly raises the computational cost of TO. This work introduces CACTO-BIC to address these challenges. CACTO-BIC improves data efficiency by biasing initial-state sampling leveraging a property of the value function associated with locally optimal policies; moreover, it reduces computation time by exploiting GPU acceleration. Empirical evaluations show improved sample efficiency and faster computation compared to CACTO. Comparisons with PPO demonstrate that our approach can achieve similar solutions in less time. Finally, experiments on the AlienGO quadruped robot demonstrate that CACTO-BIC can scale to high-dimensional systems and is suitable for real-time applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Variational Trajectory Optimization of Anisotropic Diffusion Schedules](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19512v1)** | 2026-02-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a variational framework for diffusion models with anisotropic noise schedules parameterized by a matrix-valued path $M_t(θ)$ that allocates noise across subspaces. Central to our framework is a trajectory-level objective that jointly trains the score network and learns $M_t(θ)$, which encompasses general parameterization classes of matrix-valued noise schedules. We further derive an estimator for the derivative with respect to $θ$ of the score that enables efficient optimization of the $M_t(θ)$ schedule. For inference, we develop an efficiently-implementable reverse-ODE solver that is an anisotropic generalization of the second-order Heun discretization algorithm. Across CIFAR-10, AFHQv2, FFHQ, and ImageNet-64, our method consistently improves upon the baseline EDM model in all NFE regimes.

| **[PIS: A Physics-Informed System for Accurate State Partitioning of $Aβ_{42}$ Protein Trajectories](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19444v1)** | 2026-02-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding the conformational evolution of $β$-amyloid ($Aβ$), particularly the $Aβ_{42}$ isoform, is fundamental to elucidating the pathogenic mechanisms underlying Alzheimer's disease. However, existing end-to-end deep learning models often struggle to capture subtle state transitions in protein trajectories due to a lack of explicit physical constraints. In this work, we introduce PIS, a Physics-Informed System designed for robust metastable state partitioning. By integrating pre-computed physical priors, such as the radius of gyration and solvent-accessible surface area, into the extraction of topological features, our model achieves superior performance on the $Aβ_{42}$ dataset. Furthermore, PIS provides an interactive platform that features dynamic monitoring of physical characteristics and multi-dimensional result validation. This system offers biological researchers a powerful set of analytical tools with physically grounded interpretability.

| **[The Mean of Multi-Object Trajectories](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20391v3)** | 2026-02-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces the concept of a mean for trajectories and multi-object trajectories (defined as sets or multi-sets of trajectories) along with algorithms for computing them. Specifically, we use the Fréchet mean, and metrics based on the optimal sub-pattern assignment (OSPA) construct, to extend the notion of average from vectors to trajectories and multi-object trajectories. Further, we develop efficient algorithms to compute these means using greedy search and Gibbs sampling. Using distributed multi-object tracking as an application, we demonstrate that the Fréchet mean approach to multi-object trajectory consensus significantly outperforms state-of-the-art distributed multi-object tracking methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[TSR: Trajectory-Search Rollouts for Multi-Turn RL of LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11767v2)** | 2026-02-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advances in large language models (LLMs) are driving a shift toward using reinforcement learning (RL) to train agents from iterative, multi-turn interactions across tasks. However, multi-turn RL remains challenging as rewards are often sparse or delayed, and environments can be stochastic. In this regime, naive trajectory sampling can hinder exploitation and induce mode collapse. We propose TSR (Trajectory-Search Rollouts), a training-time approach that repurposes test-time scaling ideas for improved per-turn rollout generation. TSR performs lightweight tree-style search to construct high-quality trajectories by selecting high-scoring actions at each turn using task-specific feedback. This improves rollout quality and stabilizes learning while leaving the underlying optimization objective unchanged, making TSR optimizer-agnostic. We instantiate TSR with best-of-N, beam, and shallow lookahead search, and pair it with PPO and GRPO, achieving up to 15% performance gains and more stable learning on Sokoban, FrozenLake, and WebShop tasks at a one-time increase in training compute. By moving search from inference time to the rollout stage of training, TSR provides a simple and general mechanism for stronger multi-turn agent learning, complementary to existing frameworks and rejection-sampling-style selection methods.</p></details> |  |

Although data acquisition using drones is efficient, existing datasets still have limitations in scene representativeness, information richness, and data fidelity. This study introduces FLUID, comprising a fine-grained trajectory dataset that captures dense conflicts at typical urban signalized intersections, and a lightweight, full-pipeline framework for drone-based trajectory processing. FLUID covers three distinct intersection types, with approximately 5 hours of recording time and featuring over 20,000 TPs across 8 categories. Notably, the dataset records an average of 2.8 vehicle conflicts per minute across all scenes, with roughly 15% of all recorded motor vehicles directly involved in these conflicts. FLUID provides comprehensive data, including trajectories, traffic signals, maps, and raw videos. Comparison with the DataFromSky platform and ground-truth measurements validates its high spatio-temporal accuracy. Through a detailed classification of motor vehicle conflicts and violations, FLUID reveals a diversity of interactive behaviors, demonstrating its value for human preference mining, traffic behavior modeling, and autonomous driving research.</p></details> | 30 pages, 16 figures |

Instead of predicting actions tied to specific robots, we predict the image-space coordinates of the reference trajectory as they would appear in the robot's current view. This creates robot-agnostic visual guidance that easily integrates with local planning. Consequently, our model's predictions provide guidance zero-shot across diverse embodiments. By decoupling perception from action and learning to localize trajectory points rather than imitate behavioral priors, we enable a cross-trajectory training strategy for robustness to viewpoint and camera changes. We outperform state-of-the-art methods by 20-50 percentage points in success rate on conventional forward navigation, achieving 94-98% success rate across diverse sim and real environments. Furthermore, we achieve over 5x improvements on challenging tasks where baselines fail, such as backward traversal. The system is straightforward to use: we show how even a video from a phone camera directly enables different robots to navigate to any point on the trajectory. Videos, demo, and code are available at https://finnbusch.com/lotis.</p></details> |  |

The framework jointly optimizes vehicle-level eco-driving behaviors and intersection-level traffic signal control to enhance overall network efficiency and decrease energy consumption. A decentralized Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) approach by Value Decomposition Network (VDN) manages cycle-based traffic signal control (TSC) at intersections, while an innovative Signal Phase and Timing (SPaT) prediction method integrates a Machine Learning-based Trajectory Planning Algorithm (MLTPA) to guide CAVs in executing Eco-Approach and Departure (EAD) maneuvers. The framework is evaluated across varying CAV proportions and powertrain types to assess its effects on mobility and energy performance. Experimental results conducted in a 4*4 real-world network demonstrate that the MARL-based TSC method outperforms the baseline model (i.e., Webster method) in speed, fuel consumption, and idling time. In addition, with MLTPA, HONEST-CAV benefits the traffic system further in energy consumption and idling time. With a 60% CAV proportion, vehicle average speed, fuel consumption, and idling time can be improved/saved by 7.67%, 10.23%, and 45.83% compared with the baseline. Furthermore, discussions on CAV proportions and powertrain types are conducted to quantify the performance of the proposed method with the impact of automation and electrification.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 6 figures.

When performing such structural edits, these methods either fail to achieve the intended shape change or inadvertently alter non-target regions, resulting in degraded background quality. We propose Follow-Your-Shape, a training-free and mask-free framework that supports precise and controllable editing of object shapes while strictly preserving non-target content. Motivated by the divergence between inversion and editing trajectories, we compute a Trajectory Divergence Map (TDM) by comparing token-wise velocity differences between the inversion and denoising paths. The TDM enables precise localization of editable regions and guides a Scheduled KV Injection mechanism that ensures stable and faithful editing. To facilitate a rigorous evaluation, we introduce ReShapeBench, a new benchmark comprising 120 new images and enriched prompt pairs specifically curated for shape-aware editing. Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior editability and visual fidelity, particularly in tasks requiring large-scale shape replacement.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR 2026.

| **[Watermarking LLM Agent Trajectories](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18700v1)** | 2026-02-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLM agents rely heavily on high-quality trajectory data to guide their problem-solving behaviors, yet producing such data requires substantial task design, high-capacity model generation, and manual filtering. Despite the high cost of creating these datasets, existing literature has overlooked copyright protection for LLM agent trajectories. This gap leaves creators vulnerable to data theft and makes it difficult to trace misuse or enforce ownership rights. This paper introduces ActHook, the first watermarking method tailored for agent trajectory datasets. Inspired by hook mechanisms in software engineering, ActHook embeds hook actions that are activated by a secret input key and do not alter the original task outcome. Like software execution, LLM agents operate sequentially, allowing hook actions to be inserted at decision points without disrupting task flow. When the activation key is present, an LLM agent trained on watermarked trajectories can produce these hook actions at a significantly higher rate, enabling reliable black-box detection. Experiments on mathematical reasoning, web searching, and software engineering agents show that ActHook achieves an average detection AUC of 94.3 on Qwen-2.5-Coder-7B while incurring negligible performance degradation.</p></details> | 20 pages, 9 figures |

However, existing approaches to studying multimorbidity trajectories are largely descriptive or rely on discrete-time models, which struggle to handle irregular observation intervals and right-censoring. We developed a continuous-time hidden multistate modeling framework to capture transitions among latent multimorbidity patterns while accounting for interval censoring and misclassification. A simulation study compared alternative model specifications under varying sample sizes and follow-up schemes, and the best-performing specification was applied to longitudinal data from the Swedish National study on Aging and Care-Kungsholmen (SNAC-K), including 2,716 multimorbid participants followed for up to 18 years. Simulation results showed that hidden multistate models substantially reduced bias in transition hazard estimates compared to non-hidden models, with fully time-inhomogeneous models outperforming piecewise approximations. Application to SNAC-K confirmed the feasibility and practical utility of this framework, enabling identification of risk factors for accelerated progression toward complex multimorbidity and revealing a gradient of mortality risk across patterns. Continuous-time hidden multistate models provide a robust alternative to traditional approaches, supporting individualized predictions and informing targeted interventions and secondary prevention strategies for multimorbidity in aging populations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sensor Query Schedule and Sensor Noise Covariances for Accuracy-constrained Trajectory Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16598v2)** | 2026-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory estimation involves determining the trajectory of a mobile robot by combining prior knowledge about its dynamic model with noisy observations of its state obtained using sensors. The accuracy of such a procedure is dictated by the system model fidelity and the sensor parameters, such as the accuracy of the sensor (as represented by its noise covariance) and the rate at which it can generate observations, referred to as the sensor query schedule. Intuitively, high-rate measurements from accurate sensors lead to accurate trajectory estimation. However, cost and resource constraints limit the sensor accuracy and its measurement rate. Our work's novel contribution is the estimation of sensor schedules and sensor covariances necessary to achieve a specific estimation accuracy. Concretely, we focus on estimating: (i) the rate or schedule with which a sensor of known covariance must generate measurements to achieve specific estimation accuracy, and alternatively, (ii) the sensor covariance necessary to achieve specific estimation accuracy for a given sensor update rate. We formulate the problem of estimating these sensor parameters as semidefinite programs, which can be solved by off-the-shelf solvers. We validate our approach in simulation and real experiments by showing that the sensor schedules and the sensor covariances calculated using our proposed method achieve the desired trajectory estimation accuracy. Our method also identifies scenarios where certain estimation accuracy is unachievable with the given system and sensor characteristics.</p></details> |  |

This paper investigates the generation of human-like trajectories using a receding horizon approach applied to the TickTacking interface in a target-tracking task. By analyzing user-generated trajectories, we identify key human behavioral features and incorporate them in a controller that mimics these behaviors. The performance of this human-inspired controller is evaluated against a baseline optimal-control-based agent, demonstrating the importance of specific control features for achieving human-like interaction.

This study characterized trajectories of wearable-measured physical activity during the year preceding incident MDD diagnosis. We conducted a retrospective nested case-control study using linked electronic health record and Fitbit data from the All of Us Research Program. Adults with at least 6 months of valid wearable data in the year before diagnosis were eligible. Incident MDD cases were matched to controls on age, sex, body mass index, and index time (up to four controls per case). Daily step counts and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) were aggregated into monthly averages. Linear mixed-effects models compared trajectories from 12 months before diagnosis to diagnosis. Within cases, contrasts identified when activity first significantly deviated from levels 12 months prior. The cohort included 4,104 participants (829 cases and 3,275 controls; 81.7% women; median age 48.4 years). Compared with controls, cases showed consistently lower activity and significant downward trajectories in both step counts and MVPA during the year before diagnosis (P < 0.001). Significant declines appeared about 4 months before diagnosis for step counts and 5 months for MVPA. Exploratory analyses suggested subgroup differences, including steeper declines in men, greater intensity reductions at older ages, and persistently low activity among individuals with obesity. Sustained within-person declines in physical activity emerged months before incident MDD diagnosis. Longitudinal wearable monitoring may provide early signals to support risk stratification and earlier intervention.</p></details> |  |
| **[IMPACT: Behavioral Intention-aware Multimodal Trajectory Prediction with Adaptive Context Trimming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09103v4)** | 2026-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While most prior research has focused on improving the precision of multimodal trajectory predictions, the explicit modeling of multimodal behavioral intentions (e.g., yielding, overtaking) remains relatively underexplored. This paper proposes a unified framework that jointly predicts both behavioral intentions and trajectories to enhance prediction accuracy, interpretability, and efficiency. Specifically, we employ a shared context encoder for both intention and trajectory predictions, thereby reducing structural redundancy and information loss. Moreover, we address the lack of ground-truth behavioral intention labels in mainstream datasets (Waymo, Argoverse) by auto-labeling these datasets, thus advancing the community's efforts in this direction. We further introduce a vectorized occupancy prediction module that infers the probability of each map polyline being occupied by the target vehicle's future trajectory. By leveraging these intention and occupancy prediction priors, our method conducts dynamic, modality-dependent pruning of irrelevant agents and map polylines in the decoding stage, effectively reducing computational overhead and mitigating noise from non-critical elements. Our approach ranks first among LiDAR-free methods on the Waymo Motion Dataset and achieves first place on the Waymo Interactive Prediction Dataset. Remarkably, even without model ensembling, our single-model framework improves the soft mean average precision (softmAP) by 10 percent compared to the second-best method in the Waymo Interactive Prediction Leaderboard. Furthermore, the proposed framework has been successfully deployed on real vehicles, demonstrating its practical effectiveness in real-world applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters</p></details> |

The proposed approach integrates B-spline and Quaternion interpolation techniques to manage decoupled position and orientation data points. The synchronization of orientation and arc-length-parameterized position data is achieved through the fitting of smooth piece-wise Bezier curves, which describe the non-linear relationship between path length and tool orientation, solved via sequential quadratic programming. By leveraging the convex hull properties of Bezier curves, the method ensures spatial and temporal separation constraints for multi-agent trajectory generation. Unit quaternions are employed for orientation interpolation, providing a robust and efficient representation that avoids gimbal lock and facilitates smooth, continuous rotation. Modifier polynomials are used for position interpolation.

| **[SEISMO: Increasing Sample Efficiency in Molecular Optimization with a Trajectory-Aware LLM Agent](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00663v2)** | 2026-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Optimizing the structure of molecules to achieve desired properties is a central bottleneck across the chemical sciences, particularly in the pharmaceutical industry where it underlies the discovery of new drugs. Since molecular property evaluation often relies on costly and rate-limited oracles, such as experimental assays, molecular optimization must be highly sample-efficient. To address this, we introduce SEISMO, an LLM agent that performs strictly online, inference-time molecular optimization, updating after every oracle call without the need for population-based or batched learning. SEISMO conditions each proposal on the full optimization trajectory, combining natural-language task descriptions with scalar scores and, when available, structured explanatory feedback. Across the Practical Molecular Optimization benchmark of 23 tasks, SEISMO achieves a 2-3 times higher area under the optimisation curve than prior methods, often reaching near-maximal task scores within 50 oracle calls. Our additional medicinal-chemistry tasks show that providing explanatory feedback further improves efficiency, demonstrating that leveraging domain knowledge and structured information is key to sample-efficient molecular optimization.</p></details> | <details><summary>Fabia...</summary><p>Fabian P.

| **[Multi-Agent Meta-Advisor for UAV Fleet Trajectory Design in Vehicular Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16345v1)** | 2026-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Future vehicular networks require continuous connectivity to serve highly mobile users in urban environments. To mitigate the coverage limitations of fixed terrestrial macro base stations (MBS) under non line-of-sight (NLoS) conditions, fleets of unmanned aerial base stations (UABSs) can be deployed as aerial base stations, dynamically repositioning to track vehicular users and traffic hotspots in coordination with the terrestrial network. This paper addresses cooperative multi-agent trajectory design under different service areas and takeoff configurations, where rapid and safe adaptation across scenarios is essential. We formulate the problem as a multi-task decentralized partially observable Markov decision process and solve it using centralized training and decentralized execution with double dueling deep Q-network (3DQN), enabling online training for real-world deployments. However, efficient exploration remains a bottleneck, with conventional strategies like $ε$-greedy requiring careful tuning. To overcome this, we propose the multi-agent meta-advisor with advisor override (MAMO). This framework guides agent exploration through a meta-policy learned jointly across tasks. It uses a dynamic override mechanism that allows agents to reject misaligned guidance when the advisor fails to generalize to a specific scenario. Simulation results across three realistic urban scenarios and multiple takeoff configurations show that MAMO achieves faster convergence and higher returns than tuned $ε$-greedy baselines, outperforming both an advisor-only ablation and a single generalized policy. Finally, we demonstrate that the learned UABS fleet significantly improves network performance compared to deployments without aerial support.</p></details> |  |
| **[PETS: A Principled Framework Towards Optimal Trajectory Allocation for Efficient Test-Time Self-Consistency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16745v1)** | 2026-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Test-time scaling can improve model performance by aggregating stochastic reasoning trajectories. However, achieving sample-efficient test-time self-consistency under a limited budget remains an open challenge. We introduce PETS (Principled and Efficient Test-TimeSelf-Consistency), which initiates a principled study of trajectory allocation through an optimization framework. Central to our approach is the self-consistency rate, a new measure defined as agreement with the infinite-budget majority vote. This formulation makes sample-efficient test-time allocation theoretically grounded and amenable to rigorous analysis. We study both offline and online settings. In the offline regime, where all questions are known in advance, we connect trajectory allocation to crowdsourcing, a classic and well-developed area, by modeling reasoning traces as workers. This perspective allows us to leverage rich existing theory, yielding theoretical guarantees and an efficient majority-voting-based allocation algorithm. In the online streaming regime, where questions arrive sequentially and allocations must be made on the fly, we propose a novel method inspired by the offline framework. Our approach adapts budgets to question difficulty while preserving strong theoretical guarantees and computational efficiency. Experiments show that PETS consistently outperforms uniform allocation. On GPQA, PETS achieves perfect self-consistency in both settings while reducing the sampling budget by up to 75% (offline) and 55% (online) relative to uniform allocation.

Instead of treating tracking errors as transient disturbances, our method exploits them as informative signals of local track characteristics via a Kalman-inspired spatial update. This enables the construction of an adaptive, acceleration-based constraint map that iteratively refines trajectories toward near-optimal performance under spatially varying track and vehicle behavior. In simulation, our approach achieves a 17.38% lap time reduction compared to a controller parametrized with maximum static acceleration. On real hardware, tested with different tire compounds ranging from high to low friction, we obtain a 7.60% lap time improvement without explicitly parametrizing friction. This demonstrates robustness to changing grip conditions in real-world scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICRA 2026</p></details> |

Common maneuvers dominate datasets, while dangerous or rare scenarios are sparse. This imbalance can bias models toward the frequent cases and degrade performance on critical scenarios. To tackle this problem, we compare balancing strategies for sampling training data and find reweighting by trajectory pattern an effective approach. We then present FlowDrive, a flow-matching trajectory planner that learns a conditional rectified flow to map noise directly to trajectory distributions with few flow-matching steps. We further introduce moderated, in-the-loop guidance that injects small perturbation between flow steps to systematically increase trajectory diversity while remaining scene-consistent. On nuPlan and the interaction-focused interPlan benchmarks, FlowDrive achieves state-of-the-art results among learning-based planners and approaches methods with rule-based refinements. After adding moderated guidance and light post-processing (FlowDrive*), it achieves overall state-of-the-art performance across nearly all benchmark splits.

| **[Constraining Streaming Flow Models for Adapting Learned Robot Trajectory Distributions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15567v1)** | 2026-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robot motion distributions often exhibit multi-modality and require flexible generative models for accurate representation. Streaming Flow Policies (SFPs) have recently emerged as a powerful paradigm for generating robot trajectories by integrating learned velocity fields directly in action space, enabling smooth and reactive control. However, existing formulations lack mechanisms for adapting trajectories post-training to enforce safety and task-specific constraints. We propose Constraint-Aware Streaming Flow (CASF), a framework that augments streaming flow policies with constraint-dependent metrics that reshape the learned velocity field during execution. CASF models each constraint, defined in either the robot's workspace or configuration space, as a differentiable distance function that is converted into a local metric and pulled back into the robot's control space. Far from restricted regions, the resulting metric reduces to the identity; near constraint boundaries, it smoothly attenuates or redirects motion, effectively deforming the underlying flow to maintain safety. This allows trajectories to be adapted in real time, ensuring that robot actions respect joint limits, avoid collisions, and remain within feasible workspaces, while preserving the multi-modal and reactive properties of streaming flow policies. We demonstrate CASF in simulated and real-world manipulation tasks, showing that it produces constraint-satisfying trajectories that remain smooth, feasible, and dynamically consistent, outperforming standard post-hoc projection baselines.</p></details> | 8 pages, 8 figure |
| **[SafeFlowMPC: Predictive and Safe Trajectory Planning for Robot Manipulators with Learning-based Policies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12794v2)** | 2026-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The emerging integration of robots into everyday life brings several major challenges. Compared to classical industrial applications, more flexibility is needed in combination with real-time reactivity. Learning-based methods can train powerful policies based on demonstrated trajectories, such that the robot generalizes a task to similar situations. However, these black-box models lack interpretability and rigorous safety guarantees. Optimization-based methods provide these guarantees but lack the required flexibility and generalization capabilities. This work proposes SafeFlowMPC, a combination of flow matching and online optimization to combine the strengths of learning and optimization. This method guarantees safety at all times and is designed to meet the demands of real-time execution by using a suboptimal model-predictive control formulation. SafeFlowMPC achieves strong performance in three real-world experiments on a KUKA 7-DoF manipulator, namely two grasping experiment and a dynamic human-robot object handover experiment.

| **[Directional Reasoning Trajectory Change (DRTC): Identifying Critical Trace Segments in Reasoning Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15332v1)** | 2026-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding how language models carry out long-horizon reasoning remains an open challenge. Existing interpretability methods often highlight tokens or spans correlated with an answer, but they rarely reveal where the model makes consequential reasoning turns, which earlier context causally triggers those turns, or whether the highlighted text actually steers the reasoning process. We introduce Directional Reasoning Trajectory Change (DRTC), a process-causal framework for interpreting long-form reasoning from a single on-policy rollout. DRTC detects pivot decision points using uncertainty and distribution-shift signals, then applies receiver-side interventions that preserve the realized rollout without resampling the continuation while blocking information flow from selected earlier chunks only at a pivot. It measures whether each intervention redirects the direction of the model's log-probability trajectory relative to the realized rollout direction, producing a signed per-chunk attribution score. We also compute turning-angle curvature changes on raw logits as a complementary diagnostic and introduce curvature signatures to summarize shared intervention-response geometry. Empirically, directional influence is sharply concentrated across four reasoning models (per-example |DRTC| shares yield Gini 0.50 to 0.58 and top-5 percent mass 0.23 to 0.28), and learned pivots induce stronger intervention magnitudes than matched random spans. In a scaling study on 500 MATH problems with R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, learned spans outperform matched random spans (median delta = 0.409, 355 of 500 positive; sign test p = 2.3e-21). Overall, DRTC provides a causally grounded, trajectory-level view of how specific context elements steer reasoning under on-policy dynamics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Synthesizing Trajectory Queries from Examples](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15164v1)** | 2026-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data scientists often need to write programs to process predictions of machine learning models, such as object detections and trajectories in video data. However, writing such queries can be challenging due to the fuzzy nature of real-world data; in particular, they often include real-valued parameters that must be tuned by hand. We propose a novel framework called Quivr that synthesizes trajectory queries matching a given set of examples. To efficiently synthesize parameters, we introduce a novel technique for pruning the parameter space and a novel quantitative semantics that makes this more efficient. We evaluate Quivr on a benchmark of 17 tasks, including several from prior work, and show both that it can synthesize accurate queries for each task and that our optimizations substantially reduce synthesis time.</p></details> |  |
| **[Loss Knows Best: Detecting Annotation Errors in Videos via Loss Trajectories](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15154v1)** | 2026-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-quality video datasets are foundational for training robust models in tasks like action recognition, phase detection, and event segmentation. However, many real-world video datasets suffer from annotation errors such as *mislabeling*, where segments are assigned incorrect class labels, and *disordering*, where the temporal sequence does not follow the correct progression. These errors are particularly harmful in phase-annotated tasks, where temporal consistency is critical. We propose a novel, model-agnostic method for detecting annotation errors by analyzing the Cumulative Sample Loss (CSL)--defined as the average loss a frame incurs when passing through model checkpoints saved across training epochs. This per-frame loss trajectory acts as a dynamic fingerprint of frame-level learnability. Mislabeled or disordered frames tend to show consistently high or irregular loss patterns, as they remain difficult for the model to learn throughout training, while correctly labeled frames typically converge to low loss early. To compute CSL, we train a video segmentation model and store its weights at each epoch. These checkpoints are then used to evaluate the loss of each frame in a test video. Frames with persistently high CSL are flagged as likely candidates for annotation errors, including mislabeling or temporal misalignment. Our method does not require ground truth on annotation errors and is generalizable across datasets. Experiments on EgoPER and Cholec80 demonstrate strong detection performance, effectively identifying subtle inconsistencies such as mislabeling and frame disordering. The proposed approach provides a powerful tool for dataset auditing and improving training reliability in video-based machine learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |

Using a Transformer-based model, ROSA jointly predicts the future trajectories of vehicles and Vulnerable Road Users (VRUs) at roundabouts. Trained for single-step prediction and deployed autoregressively, it generates deterministic outputs, enabling actionable speed advisories. Incorporating motion dynamics, the model achieves high accuracy (ADE: 1.29m, FDE: 2.99m at a five-second prediction horizon), surpassing prior work. Adding route intention further improves performance (ADE: 1.10m, FDE: 2.36m), demonstrating the value of connected vehicle data. Based on predicted conflicts with VRUs and circulating vehicles, ROSA provides real-time, proactive speed advisories for approaching and entering the roundabout. Despite prediction uncertainty, ROSA significantly improves vehicle efficiency and safety, with positive effects even on perceived safety from a VRU perspective.

| **[BoundPlanner: A convex-set-based approach to bounded manipulator trajectory planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13286v2)** | 2026-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Online trajectory planning enables robot manipulators to react quickly to changing environments or tasks. Many robot trajectory planners exist for known environments but are often too slow for online computations. Current methods in online trajectory planning do not find suitable trajectories in challenging scenarios that respect the limits of the robot and account for collisions. This work proposes a trajectory planning framework consisting of the novel Cartesian path planner based on convex sets, called BoundPlanner, and the online trajectory planner BoundMPC. BoundPlanner explores and maps the collision-free space using convex sets to compute a reference path with bounds. BoundMPC is extended in this work to handle convex sets for path deviations, which allows the robot to optimally follow the path within the bounds while accounting for the robot's kinematics. Collisions of the robot's kinematic chain are considered by a novel convex-set-based collision avoidance formulation independent on the number of obstacles. Simulations and experiments with a 7-DoF manipulator show the performance of the proposed planner compared to state-of-the-art methods. The source code is available at github.com/TU-Wien-ACIN-CDS/BoundPlanner and videos of the experiments can be found at www.acin.tuwien.ac.at/42d4.</p></details> | Published at RA-L |
| **[A representational framework for learning and encoding structurally enriched trajectories in complex agent environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13194v3)** | 2026-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The ability of artificial intelligence agents to make optimal decisions and generalise them to different domains and tasks is compromised in complex scenarios. One way to address this issue has focused on learning efficient representations of the world and on how the actions of agents affect them in state-action transitions. Whereas such representations are procedurally efficient, they lack structural richness. To address this problem, we propose to enhance the agent's ontology and extend the traditional conceptualisation of trajectories to provide a more nuanced view of task execution. Structurally Enriched Trajectories (SETs) extend the encoding of sequences of states and their transitions by incorporating hierarchical relations between objects, interactions, and affordances. SETs are built as multi-level graphs, providing a detailed representation of the agent dynamics and a transferable functional abstraction of the task. SETs are integrated into an architecture, Structurally Enriched Trajectory Learning and Encoding (SETLE), that employs a heterogeneous graph-based memory structure of multi-level relational dependencies essential for generalisation. We demonstrate that SETLE can support downstream tasks, enabling agents to recognise task relevant structural patterns across CREATE and MiniGrid environments. Finally, we integrate SETLE with reinforcement learning and show measurable improvements in downstream performance, including breakthrough success rates in complex, sparse-reward tasks.</p></details> |  |

We present a trajectory-centric evaluation of Clawdbot across six risk dimensions. Our test suite samples and lightly adapts scenarios from prior agent-safety benchmarks (including ATBench and LPS-Bench) and supplements them with hand-designed cases tailored to Clawdbot's tool surface. We log complete interaction trajectories (messages, actions, tool-call arguments/outputs) and assess safety using both an automated trajectory judge (AgentDoG-Qwen3-4B) and human review. Across 34 canonical cases, we find a non-uniform safety profile: performance is generally consistent on reliability-focused tasks, while most failures arise under underspecified intent, open-ended goals, or benign-seeming jailbreak prompts, where minor misinterpretations can escalate into higher-impact tool actions. We supplemented the overall results with representative case studies and summarized the commonalities of these cases, analyzing the security vulnerabilities and typical failure modes that Clawdbot is prone to trigger in practice.</p></details> |  |

Current benchmarks, however, are largely restricted to idealized simulations, failing to address the practical demands of specialized domains like advertising and marketing analytics. In these fields, tasks are inherently more complex, often requiring multi-round interaction with professional marketing tools. To address this gap, we propose AD-Bench, a benchmark designed based on real-world business requirements of advertising and marketing platforms. AD-Bench is constructed from real user marketing analysis requests, with domain experts providing verifiable reference answers and corresponding reference tool-call trajectories. The benchmark categorizes requests into three difficulty levels (L1-L3) to evaluate agents' capabilities under multi-round, multi-tool collaboration. Experiments show that on AD-Bench, Gemini-3-Pro achieves Pass@1 = 68.0% and Pass@3 = 83.0%, but performance drops significantly on L3 to Pass@1 = 49.4% and Pass@3 = 62.1%, with a trajectory coverage of 70.1%, indicating that even state-of-the-art models still exhibit substantial capability gaps in complex advertising and marketing analysis scenarios.

While ARC has inspired extensive research on abstract reasoning, most existing approaches rely on static input-output supervision, which limits insight into how reasoning unfolds over time. ARCTraj addresses this gap by recording temporally ordered, object-level actions that capture how humans iteratively transform inputs into outputs, revealing intermediate reasoning steps that conventional datasets overlook. Collected via the O2ARC web interface, it contains around 10,000 trajectories annotated with task identifiers, timestamps, and success labels across 400 training tasks from the ARC-AGI-1 benchmark. It further defines a unified reasoning pipeline encompassing data collection, action abstraction, Markov decision process (MDP) formulation, and downstream learning, enabling integration with reinforcement learning, generative modeling, and sequence modeling methods such as PPO, World Models, GFlowNets, Diffusion agents, and Decision Transformers. Analyses of spatial selection, color attribution, and strategic convergence highlight the structure and diversity of human reasoning. Together, these contributions position ARCTraj as a structured and interpretable foundation for studying human-like reasoning, advancing explainability, alignment, and generalizable intelligence.</p></details> | <details><summary>KDD 2...</summary><p>KDD 2026 (Datasets and Benchmarks) accepted</p></details> |

However, achieving effective zero-shot generalization in previously unseen domains remains a significant challenge. Motivated by the consistent nature of kinematics across diverse domains, we aim to incorporate domain-invariant knowledge to enhance zero-shot trajectory prediction capabilities. The key challenges include: 1) effectively extracting domain-invariant scene representations, and 2) integrating invariant features with kinematic models to enable generalized predictions. To address these challenges, we propose a novel generalizable Physics-guided Causal Model (PCM), which comprises two core components: a Disentangled Scene Encoder, which adopts intervention-based disentanglement to extract domain-invariant features from scenes, and a CausalODE Decoder, which employs a causal attention mechanism to effectively integrate kinematic models with meaningful contextual information. Extensive experiments on real-world autonomous driving datasets demonstrate our method's superior zero-shot generalization performance in unseen cities, significantly outperforming competitive baselines.

While recent methods often rely on high-definition (HD) maps to provide structured environmental priors, such maps are costly to maintain, geographically limited, and unreliable in dynamic or unmapped scenarios. Directly leveraging raw sensor data in Bird's-Eye View (BEV) space offers greater flexibility, but BEV features are dense and unstructured, making agent-centric spatial reasoning challenging and computationally inefficient. To address this, we propose Bird's-Eye View Trajectory Prediction (BEVTraj), a map-free framework that employs deformable attention to adaptively aggregate task-relevant context from sparse locations in dense BEV features. We further introduce a Sparse Goal Candidate Proposal (SGCP) module that predicts a small set of realistic goals, enabling fully end-to-end multimodal forecasting without heuristic post-processing. Extensive experiments show that BEVTraj achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art HD map-based methods while providing greater robustness and flexibility without relying on pre-built maps.

Each sacrificial agent follows a straight-line trajectory toward an adversary and reports whether it was intercepted or survived. These binary outcomes are related to the pursuer's parameters through a geometric reachable-region (RR) model. Two formulations are introduced: a boundary-interception case, where capture occurs at the RR boundary, and an interior-interception case, which allows capture anywhere within it. The pursuer's parameters are inferred using a gradient-based multi-start optimization with custom loss functions tailored to each case. Two trajectory-selection strategies are proposed for the sacrificial agents: a geometric heuristic that maximizes the spread of expected interception points, and a Bayesian experimental-design method that maximizes the D-score of the expected Gauss-Newton information matrix, thereby selecting trajectories that yield maximal information gain. Monte Carlo experiments demonstrate accurate parameter recovery with five to twelve sacrificial agents. The learned engagement models are then used to generate safe, time-optimal paths for high-value agents that avoid all feasible pursuer engagement regions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to the Journal of Aerospace Information Systems</p></details> |

However, such data are often difficult to obtain. Meanwhile, most existing trajectory generation methods implicitly assume that at least a subset of real mobility data from target city is available, which limits their applicability in data-inaccessible scenarios. In this work, we propose a new problem setting, called bus-conditioned zero-shot trajectory generation, where no mobility trajectories from a target city are accessible. The generation process relies solely on source city mobility data and publicly available bus timetables from both cities. Under this setting, we propose MobTA, the first approach to introduce task arithmetic into trajectory generation. MobTA models the parameter shift from bus-timetable-based trajectory generation to mobility trajectory generation in source city, and applies this shift to target city through arithmetic operations on task vectors. This enables trajectory generation that reflects target-city mobility patterns without requiring any real mobility data from it. Furthermore, we theoretically analyze MobTA's stability across base and instruction-tuned LLMs. Extensive experiments show that MobTA significantly outperforms existing methods, and achieves performance close to models finetuned using target city mobility trajectories.</p></details> |  |

Recent research aims to develop end-to-end models that jointly address perception and prediction; however, they often fail to fully exploit the synergy between appearance and motion cues, relying mainly on short-term visual features. We follow the idea of "looking backward to look forward", and propose MASAR, a novel fully differentiable framework for joint 3D detection and trajectory forecasting compatible with any transformer-based 3D detector. MASAR employs an object-centric spatio-temporal mechanism that jointly encodes appearance and motion features. By predicting past trajectories and refining them using guidance from appearance cues, MASAR captures long-term temporal dependencies that enhance future trajectory forecasting. Experiments conducted on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate MASAR's effectiveness, showing improvements of over 20% in minADE and minFDE while maintaining robust detection performance.

Tracking how vortices move, weaken, and dissipate over time from LiDAR measurements is still difficult because scans are sparse, vortex signatures fade as the flow breaks down under atmospheric turbulence and instabilities, and point-wise annotation is prohibitively expensive. Existing approaches largely treat each scan as an independent, fully supervised segmentation problem, which overlooks temporal structure and does not scale to the vast unlabeled archives collected in practice. We present X-VORTEX, a spatio-temporal contrastive learning framework grounded in Augmentation Overlap Theory that learns physics-aware representations from unlabeled LiDAR point cloud sequences. X-VORTEX addresses two core challenges: sensor sparsity and time-varying vortex dynamics. It constructs paired inputs from the same underlying flight event by combining a weakly perturbed sequence with a strongly augmented counterpart produced via temporal subsampling and spatial masking, encouraging the model to align representations across missing frames and partial observations. Architecturally, a time-distributed geometric encoder extracts per-scan features and a sequential aggregator models the evolving vortex state across variable-length sequences. We evaluate on a real-world dataset of over one million LiDAR scans. X-VORTEX achieves superior vortex center localization while using only 1% of the labeled data required by supervised baselines, and the learned representations support accurate trajectory forecasting.</p></details> |  |
| **[WebClipper: Efficient Evolution of Web Agents with Graph-based Trajectory Pruning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12852v1)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep Research systems based on web agents have shown strong potential in solving complex information-seeking tasks, yet their search efficiency remains underexplored. We observe that many state-of-the-art open-source web agents rely on long tool-call trajectories with cyclic reasoning loops and exploration of unproductive branches. To address this, we propose WebClipper, a framework that compresses web agent trajectories via graph-based pruning. Concretely, we model the agent's search process as a state graph and cast trajectory optimization as a minimum-necessary Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) mining problem, yielding pruned trajectories that preserve essential reasoning while eliminating redundant steps. Continued training on these refined trajectories enables the agent to evolve toward more efficient search patterns and reduces tool-call rounds by about 20% while improving accuracy. Furthermore, we introduce a new metric called F-AE Score to measure the model's overall performance in balancing accuracy and efficiency. Experiments demonstrate that WebClipper compresses tool-call rounds under excellent performance, providing practical insight into balancing effectiveness and efficiency in web agent design.</p></details> | Work in Progress |
| **[T3D: Few-Step Diffusion Language Models via Trajectory Self-Distillation with Direct Discriminative Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12262v2)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion large language models (DLLMs) have the potential to enable fast text generation by decoding multiple tokens in parallel. However, in practice, their inference efficiency is constrained by the need for many refinement steps, while aggressively reducing the number of steps leads to a substantial degradation in generation quality. To alleviate this, we propose a trajectory self-distillation framework that improves few-step decoding by distilling the model's own generative trajectories. We incorporate Direct Discriminative Optimization (DDO), a reverse-KL objective that promotes mode-seeking distillation and encourages the student to concentrate on high-probability teacher modes. Across benchmarks, our approach consistently outperforms strong few-step baselines and standard training under tight step budgets. Although full-step decoding remains superior, we substantially narrow the gap, establishing a strong foundation towards practical few-step DLLMs. The source code is available at https://github.com/Tyrion58/T3D.</p></details> |  |
| **[Which Reasoning Trajectories Teach Students to Reason Better? A Simple Metric of Informative Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14249v3)** | 2026-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Long chain-of-thought (CoT) trajectories provide rich supervision signals for distilling reasoning from teacher to student LLMs. However, both prior work and our experiments show that trajectories from stronger teachers do not necessarily yield better students, highlighting the importance of data-student suitability in distillation. Existing methods assess suitability primarily through student likelihood, favoring trajectories that align closely with the student model's current behavior but overlooking more informative ones. Addressing this, we propose Rank-Surprisal Ratio (RSR), a simple metric that captures both alignment and informativeness to assess the suitability of a reasoning trajectory. RSR is motivated by the observation that effective trajectories typically balance learning signal strength and behavioral alignment by combining low absolute probability with relatively high-ranked tokens under the student model. Concretely, RSR is defined as the ratio of a trajectory's average token-wise rank to its average negative log-likelihood, and is straightforward to compute and interpret. Across five student models and reasoning trajectories from 11 diverse teachers, RSR strongly correlates with post-training reasoning performance (average Spearman 0.86), consistently outperforming existing metrics. We further demonstrate its practical utility in both trajectory selection and teacher selection.</p></details> | <details><summary>29 pa...</summary><p>29 pages.

This paper presents CORTEX (Convex Optimization for Rendezvous Trajectory Execution), an autonomous, perception-enabled, real-time trajectory design and guidance framework for close-range rendezvous. CORTEX integrates a deep-learning perception pipeline with convex-optimisation-based trajectory design and guidance, including reference regeneration and abort-to-safe-orbit logic to recover from large deviations caused by sensor faults and engine failures. CORTEX is validated in high-fidelity software simulation and hardware-in-the-loop experiments. The software pipeline (Basilisk) models high-fidelity relative dynamics, realistic thruster execution, perception, and attitude control. Hardware testing uses (i) an optical navigation testbed to assess perception-to-estimation performance and (ii) a planar air-bearing testbed to evaluate the end-to-end guidance loop under representative actuation and subsystem effects. A Monte-Carlo campaign in simulation includes initial-state uncertainty, thrust-magnitude errors, and missed-thrust events; under the strongest case investigated, CORTEX achieves terminal docking errors of $36.85 \pm 44.46$ mm in relative position and $1.25 \pm 2.26$ mm/s in relative velocity. On the planar air-bearing testbed, 18 cases are executed (10 nominal; 8 off-nominal requiring recomputation and/or abort due to simulated engine failure and sensor malfunctions), yielding terminal errors of $8.09 \pm 5.29$ mm in position and $2.23 \pm 1.72$ mm/s in velocity.</p></details> |  |
| **[PathCRF: Ball-Free Soccer Event Detection via Possession Path Inference from Player Trajectories](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12080v1)** | 2026-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite recent advances in AI, event data collection in soccer still relies heavily on labor-intensive manual annotation. Although prior work has explored automatic event detection using player and ball trajectories, ball tracking also remains difficult to scale due to high infrastructural and operational costs. As a result, comprehensive data collection in soccer is largely confined to top-tier competitions, limiting the broader adoption of data-driven analysis in this domain. To address this challenge, this paper proposes PathCRF, a framework for detecting on-ball soccer events using only player tracking data. We model player trajectories as a fully connected dynamic graph and formulate event detection as the problem of selecting exactly one edge corresponding to the current possession state at each time step. To ensure logical consistency of the resulting edge sequence, we employ a Conditional Random Field (CRF) that forbids impossible transitions between consecutive edges. Both emission and transition scores dynamically computed from edge embeddings produced by a Set Attention-based backbone architecture. During inference, the most probable edge sequence is obtained via Viterbi decoding, and events such as ball controls or passes are detected whenever the selected edge changes between adjacent time steps. Experiments show that PathCRF produces accurate, logically consistent possession paths, enabling reliable downstream analyses while substantially reducing the need for manual event annotation.

| **[Data-Driven Trajectory Imputation for Vessel Mobility Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11890v1)** | 2026-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modeling vessel activity at sea is critical for a wide range of applications, including route planning, transportation logistics, maritime safety, and environmental monitoring. Over the past two decades, the Automatic Identification System (AIS) has enabled real-time monitoring of hundreds of thousands of vessels, generating huge amounts of data daily. One major challenge in using AIS data is the presence of large gaps in vessel trajectories, often caused by coverage limitations or intentional transmission interruptions. These gaps can significantly degrade data quality, resulting in inaccurate or incomplete analysis. State-of-the-art imputation approaches have mainly been devised to tackle gaps in vehicle trajectories, even when the underlying road network is not considered. But the motion patterns of sailing vessels differ substantially, e.g., smooth turns, maneuvering near ports, or navigating in adverse weather conditions. In this application paper, we propose HABIT, a lightweight, configurable H3 Aggregation-Based Imputation framework for vessel Trajectories. This data-driven framework provides a valuable means to impute missing trajectory segments by extracting, analyzing, and indexing motion patterns from historical AIS data. Our empirical study over AIS data across various timeframes, densities, and vessel types reveals that HABIT produces maritime trajectory imputations performing comparably to baseline methods in terms of accuracy, while performing better in terms of latency while accounting for vessel characteristics and their motion patterns.</p></details> | <details><summary>Inter...</summary><p>International Conference on Extending Database Technology (EDBT 2026)</p></details> |

However, attempts to further improve LoopLM reasoning with reinforcement learning have failed - standard objectives such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) only assign credit to the final latent state, creating a fundamental mismatch with the model's internal computation. To resolve this, we introduce RLTT (Reward Latent Thought Trajectories), a reinforcement learning framework which distributes reward across the full latent reasoning trajectory. RLTT provides dense, trajectory-level credit assignment without relying on external verifiers and can directly replace GRPO with negligible overhead. Across extensive experiments with Ouro-2.6B-Thinking under identical training and inference conditions, RLTT yields substantial improvements over GRPO on challenging mathematical reasoning benchmarks, improving accuracy by +14.4% on MATH-500, +16.6% on AIME24, and +10.0% on BeyondAIME. Despite being trained exclusively on mathematics, RLTT also transfers effectively to non-mathematical reasoning benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of trajectory-level credit assignment for reinforcement learning in LoopLMs.</p></details> |  |

Existing approaches largely rely on human teleoperation with wearable devices or specialized sensing equipment to capture hand-object interactions, which limits scalability. In this work, we propose VIDEOMANIP, a device-free framework that learns dexterous manipulation directly from RGB human videos. Leveraging recent advances in computer vision, VIDEOMANIP reconstructs explicit 3D robot-object trajectories from monocular videos by estimating human hand poses, object meshes, and retargets the reconstructed human motions to robotic hands for manipulation learning. To make the reconstructed robot data suitable for dexterous manipulation training, we introduce hand-object contact optimization with interaction-centric grasp modeling, as well as a demonstration synthesis strategy that generates diverse training trajectories from a single video, enabling generalizable policy learning without additional robot demonstrations. In simulation, the learned grasping model achieves a 70.25% success rate across 20 diverse objects using the Inspire Hand. In the real world, manipulation policies trained from RGB videos achieve an average 62.86% success rate across seven tasks using the LEAP Hand, outperforming retargeting-based methods by 15.87%.

| **[TRACER: Trajectory Risk Aggregation for Critical Episodes in Agentic Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11409v1)** | 2026-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Estimating uncertainty for AI agents in real-world multi-turn tool-using interaction with humans is difficult because failures are often triggered by sparse critical episodes (e.g., looping, incoherent tool use, or user-agent miscoordination) even when local generation appears confident. Existing uncertainty proxies focus on single-shot text generation and therefore miss these trajectory-level breakdown signals. We introduce TRACER, a trajectory-level uncertainty metric for dual-control Tool-Agent-User interaction. TRACER combines content-aware surprisal with situational-awareness signals, semantic and lexical repetition, and tool-grounded coherence gaps, and aggregates them using a tail-focused risk functional with a MAX-composite step risk to surface decisive anomalies. We evaluate TRACER on $τ^2$-bench by predicting task failure and selective task execution. To this end, TRACER improves AUROC by up to 37.1% and AUARC by up to 55% over baselines, enabling earlier and more accurate detection of uncertainty in complex conversational tool-use settings. Our code and benchmark are available at https://github.com/sinatayebati/agent-tracer.</p></details> |  |

They discard information during image encoding, require a separately trained decoder, and model an auxiliary distribution to the raw data. In this paper, we propose Latent Forcing, a simple modification to existing architectures that achieves the efficiency of latent diffusion while operating on raw natural images. Our approach orders the denoising trajectory by jointly processing latents and pixels with separately tuned noise schedules. This allows the latents to act as a scratchpad for intermediate computation before high-frequency pixel features are generated. We find that the order of conditioning signals is critical, and we analyze this to explain differences between REPA distillation in the tokenizer and the diffusion model, conditional versus unconditional generation, and how tokenizer reconstruction quality relates to diffusability. Applied to ImageNet, Latent Forcing achieves a new state-of-the-art for diffusion transformer-based pixel generation at our compute scale.</p></details> | 8 pages, 6 figures |

UAVs equipped with gimballed electro-optical sensors are typically used to localize targets, however, reliance on these sensors increases mechanical complexity, cost, and susceptibility to single-point failures, limiting scalability and robustness in multi-UAV operations. This work presents a new trajectory optimization framework that enables cooperative target localization using UAVs with fixed, non-gimballed cameras operating in coordination with a surface vessel. This estimation-aware optimization generates dynamically feasible trajectories that explicitly account for mission constraints, platform dynamics, and out-of-frame events. Estimation-aware trajectories outperform heuristic paths by reducing localization error by more than a factor of two, motivating their use in cooperative operations. Results further demonstrate that coordinated UAVs with fixed, non-gimballed cameras achieve localization accuracy that meets or exceeds that of single gimballed systems, while substantially lowering system complexity and cost, enabling scalability, and enhancing mission resilience.</p></details> | <details><summary>38 pa...</summary><p>38 pages, 7 figure, and 6 tables</p></details> |

In many real-world domains, online learning in the environment can be risky, and specifying accurate safety costs can be difficult. However, it is often feasible to collect trajectories that reflect undesirable or unsafe behavior, implicitly conveying what the agent should avoid. We refer to these as non-preferred trajectories. We propose a novel offline safe IL algorithm, OSIL, that infers safety from non-preferred demonstrations. We formulate safe policy learning as a Constrained Markov Decision Process (CMDP). Instead of relying on explicit safety cost and reward annotations, OSIL reformulates the CMDP problem by deriving a lower bound on reward maximizing objective and learning a cost model that estimates the likelihood of non-preferred behavior. Our approach allows agents to learn safe and reward-maximizing behavior entirely from offline demonstrations. We empirically demonstrate that our approach can learn safer policies that satisfy cost constraints without degrading the reward performance, thus outperforming several baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, Accepted at AAMAS 2026</p></details> |

While prior work has focused on accuracy, social interaction modeling, and diversity, little attention has been paid to uncertainty modeling, calibration, and forecasts from short observation periods, which are crucial for downstream tasks such as path planning and collision avoidance. We propose DD-MDN, an end-to-end probabilistic HTF model that combines high positional accuracy, calibrated uncertainty, and robustness to short observations. Using a few-shot denoising diffusion backbone and a dual mixture density network, our method learns self-calibrated residence areas and probability-ranked anchor paths, from which diverse trajectory hypotheses are derived, without predefined anchors or endpoints. Experiments on the ETH/UCY, SDD, inD, and IMPTC datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art accuracy, robustness at short observation intervals, and reliable uncertainty modeling.

| **[Self-Augmented Robot Trajectory: Efficient Imitation Learning via Safe Self-augmentation with Demonstrator-annotated Precision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09893v2)** | 2026-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Imitation learning is a promising paradigm for training robot agents; however, standard approaches typically require substantial data acquisition -- via numerous demonstrations or random exploration -- to ensure reliable performance. Although exploration reduces human effort, it lacks safety guarantees and often results in frequent collisions -- particularly in clearance-limited tasks (e.g., peg-in-hole) -- thereby, necessitating manual environmental resets and imposing additional human burden. This study proposes Self-Augmented Robot Trajectory (SART), a framework that enables policy learning from a single human demonstration, while safely expanding the dataset through autonomous augmentation. SART consists of two stages: (1) human teaching only once, where a single demonstration is provided and precision boundaries -- represented as spheres around key waypoints -- are annotated, followed by one environment reset; (2) robot self-augmentation, where the robot generates diverse, collision-free trajectories within these boundaries and reconnects to the original demonstration. This design improves the data collection efficiency by minimizing human effort while ensuring safety. Extensive evaluations in simulation and real-world manipulation tasks show that SART achieves substantially higher success rates than policies trained solely on human-collected demonstrations.

One promising recent approach addresses graph transfer by discretizing the adaptation process, typically through the construction of intermediate graphs or stepwise alignment procedures. However, such discrete strategies often fail in real-world scenarios, where graph structures evolve continuously and nonlinearly, making it difficult for fixed-step alignment to approximate the actual transformation process. To address these limitations, we propose \textbf{DiffGDA}, a \textbf{Diff}usion-based \textbf{GDA} method that models the domain adaptation process as a continuous-time generative process. We formulate the evolution from source to target graphs using stochastic differential equations (SDEs), enabling the joint modeling of structural and semantic transitions. To guide this evolution, a domain-aware network is introduced to steer the generative process toward the target domain, encouraging the diffusion trajectory to follow an optimal adaptation path. We theoretically show that the diffusion process converges to the optimal solution bridging the source and target domains in the latent space. Extensive experiments on 14 graph transfer tasks across 8 real-world datasets demonstrate DiffGDA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by ICLR 2026, 21 pages</p></details> |
| **[Driving Reaction Trajectories via Latent Flow Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10476v1)** | 2026-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in reaction prediction have achieved near-saturated accuracy on standard benchmarks (e.g., USPTO), yet most state-of-the-art models formulate the task as a one-shot mapping from reactants to products, offering limited insight into the underlying reaction process. Procedural alternatives introduce stepwise generation but often rely on mechanism-specific supervision, discrete symbolic edits, and computationally expensive inference. In this work, we propose LatentRxnFlow, a new reaction prediction paradigm that models reactions as continuous latent trajectories anchored at the thermodynamic product state. Built on Conditional Flow Matching, our approach learns time-dependent latent dynamics directly from standard reactant-product pairs, without requiring mechanistic annotations or curated intermediate labels. While LatentRxnFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance on USPTO benchmarks, more importantly, the continuous formulation exposes the full generative trajectory, enabling trajectory-level diagnostics that are difficult to realize with discrete or one-shot models. We show that latent trajectory analysis allows us to localize and characterize failure modes and to mitigate certain errors via gated inference. Furthermore, geometric properties of the learned trajectories provide an intrinsic signal of epistemic uncertainty, helping prioritize reliably predictable reaction outcomes and flag ambiguous cases for additional validation. Overall, LatentRxnFlow combines strong predictive accuracy with improved transparency, diagnosability, and uncertainty awareness, moving reaction prediction toward more trustworthy deployment in high-throughput discovery workflows.</p></details> |  |
| **[TABES: Trajectory-Aware Backward-on-Entropy Steering for Masked Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00250v2)** | 2026-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Masked Diffusion Models (MDMs) have emerged as a promising non-autoregressive paradigm for generative tasks, offering parallel decoding and bidirectional context utilization. However, current sampling methods rely on simple confidence-based heuristics that ignore the long-term impact of local decisions, leading to trajectory lock-in where early hallucinations cascade into global incoherence. While search-based methods mitigate this, they incur prohibitive computational costs ($O(K)$ forward passes per step). In this work, we propose Backward-on-Entropy (BoE) Steering, a gradient-guided inference framework that approximates infinite-horizon lookahead via a single backward pass. We formally derive the Token Influence Score (TIS) from a first-order expansion of the trajectory cost functional, proving that the gradient of future entropy with respect to input embeddings serves as an optimal control signal for minimizing uncertainty. To ensure scalability, we introduce \texttt{ActiveQueryAttention}, a sparse adjoint primitive that exploits the structure of the masking objective to reduce backward pass complexity. BoE achieves a superior Pareto frontier for inference-time scaling compared to existing unmasking methods, demonstrating that gradient-guided steering offers a mathematically principled and efficient path to robust non-autoregressive generation. We will release the code.</p></details> |  |
| **[Solving Geodesic Equations with Composite Bernstein Polynomials for Trajectory Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10365v1)** | 2026-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work presents a trajectory planning method based on composite Bernstein polynomials for autonomous systems navigating complex environments. The method is implemented in a symbolic optimization framework that enables continuous paths and precise control over trajectory shape. Trajectories are planned over a cost surface that encodes obstacles as continuous fields rather than discrete boundaries. Regions near obstacles are assigned higher costs, naturally encouraging the trajectory to maintain a safe distance while still allowing efficient routing through constrained spaces. The use of composite Bernstein polynomials preserves continuity while enabling fine control over local curvature to satisfy geodesic constraints. The symbolic representation supports exact derivatives, improving optimization efficiency. The method applies to both two- and three-dimensional environments and is suitable for ground, aerial, underwater, and space systems. In spacecraft trajectory planning, for example, it enables the generation of continuous, dynamically feasible trajectories with high numerical efficiency, making it well suited for orbital maneuvers, rendezvous and proximity operations, cluttered gravitational environments, and planetary exploration missions with limited onboard computational resources. Demonstrations show that the approach efficiently generates smooth, collision-free paths in scenarios with multiple obstacles, maintaining clearance without extensive sampling or post-processing. The optimization incorporates three constraint types: (1) a Gaussian surface inequality enforcing minimum obstacle clearance; (2) geodesic equations guiding the path along locally efficient directions on the cost surface; and (3) boundary constraints enforcing fixed start and end conditions. The method can serve as a standalone planner or as an initializer for more complex motion planning problems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for the 2026 IEEE Aerospace Conference</p></details> |

In this work, we formulate the trajectory tracking problem as an optimal control problem and solve it using a combination of B-spline parametrization with Bayesian optimization, allowing the treatment of high computational costs without requiring complex gradient computations. Applied to a flagellated magnetic swimmer, the proposed method reproduces a variety of target trajectories, including biologically inspired paths observed in experimental studies. We further evaluate the approach on a three-sphere swimmer model, demonstrating that it can adapt to and partially compensate for wall-induced hydrodynamic effects. The proposed optimization strategy can be applied consistently across models of different fidelity, from low-dimensional ODE-based models to high-fidelity PDE-based simulations, showing its robustness and generality. These results highlight the potential of Bayesian optimization as a versatile tool for optimal control strategies in microscale locomotion under complex fluid-structure interactions.</p></details> | 16 pages, 16 figures |

Various training-free flow matching approaches have been developed to improve image generation through flow velocity field adjustment, eliminating the need for costly retraining. However, Modifying the velocity field $v$ introduces errors that propagate through the full generation path, whereas adjustments to the latent trajectory $z$ are naturally corrected by the pretrained velocity network, reducing error accumulation. In this paper, we propose two complementary training-free latent-trajectory adjustment approaches based on future and past velocity $v$ and latent trajectory $z$ information that refine the generative path directly in latent space. We propose two training-free trajectory smoothing schemes: \emph{Look-Ahead}, which averages the current and next-step latents using a curvature-gated weight, and \emph{Look-Back}, which smoothes latents using an exponential moving average with decay. We demonstrate through extensive experiments and comprehensive evaluation metrics that the proposed training-free trajectory smoothing models substantially outperform various state-of-the-art models across multiple datasets including COCO17, CUB-200, and Flickr30K.</p></details> |  |

However, progress in this field is hindered by two key challenges: the over-reliance on older datasets from 2012-2013 and the lack of reproducible, city-level check-in datasets that reflect diverse global regions. To address these gaps, we present Massive-STEPS (Massive Semantic Trajectories for Understanding POI Check-ins), a large-scale, publicly available benchmark dataset built upon the Semantic Trails dataset and enriched with semantic POI metadata. Massive-STEPS spans 15 geographically and culturally diverse cities and features more recent (2017-2018) and longer-duration (24 months) check-in data than prior datasets. We benchmarked a wide range of POI models on Massive-STEPS using both supervised and zero-shot approaches, and evaluated their performance across multiple urban contexts. By releasing Massive-STEPS, we aim to facilitate reproducible and equitable research in human mobility and POI trajectory modeling.

| **[From Legible to Inscrutable Trajectories: (Il)legible Motion Planning Accounting for Multiple Observers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09227v1)** | 2026-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In cooperative environments, such as in factories or assistive scenarios, it is important for a robot to communicate its intentions to observers, who could be either other humans or robots. A legible trajectory allows an observer to quickly and accurately predict an agent's intention. In adversarial environments, such as in military operations or games, it is important for a robot to not communicate its intentions to observers. An illegible trajectory leads an observer to incorrectly predict the agent's intention or delays when an observer is able to make a correct prediction about the agent's intention. However, in some environments there are multiple observers, each of whom may be able to see only part of the environment, and each of whom may have different motives. In this work, we introduce the Mixed-Motive Limited-Observability Legible Motion Planning (MMLO-LMP) problem, which requires a motion planner to generate a trajectory that is legible to observers with positive motives and illegible to observers with negative motives while also considering the visibility limitations of each observer. We highlight multiple strategies an agent can take while still achieving the problem objective. We also present DUBIOUS, a trajectory optimizer that solves MMLO-LMP. Our results show that DUBIOUS can generate trajectories that balance legibility with the motives and limited visibility regions of the observers. Future work includes many variations of MMLO-LMP, including moving observers and observer teaming.</p></details> | 17 pages, 5 figures |

While most existing approaches treat human as point mass, we present a study on multi-agent trajectory prediction that leverages different human skeletal features for improved forecast accuracy. In particular, we systematically evaluate the predictive utility of 2D and 3D skeletal keypoints and derived biomechanical cues as additional inputs. Through a comprehensive study on the JRDB dataset and another new dataset for social navigation with 360-degree panoramic videos, we find that focusing on lower-body 3D keypoints yields a 13% reduction in Average Displacement Error and augmenting 3D keypoint inputs with corresponding biomechanical cues provides a further 1-4% improvement. Notably, the performance gain persists when using 2D keypoint inputs extracted from equirectangular panoramic images, indicating that monocular surround vision can capture informative cues for motion forecasting. Our finding that robots can forecast human movement efficiently by watching their legs provides actionable insights for designing sensing capabilities for social robot navigation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE ICRA 2026</p></details> |

Moreover, quantity-centric scaling exhibits an early bottleneck that underutilizes trajectory data. We propose TDScaling, a Trajectory Diversity Scaling-based data synthesis framework for code agents that scales performance through diversity rather than raw volume. Under a fixed training budget, increasing trajectory diversity yields larger gains than adding more trajectories, improving the performance-cost trade-off for agent training. TDScaling integrates four innovations: (1) a Business Cluster mechanism that captures real-service logical dependencies; (2) a blueprint-driven multi-agent paradigm that enforces trajectory coherence; (3) an adaptive evolution mechanism that steers synthesis toward long-tail scenarios using Domain Entropy, Reasoning Mode Entropy, and Cumulative Action Complexity to prevent mode collapse; and (4) a sandboxed code tool that mitigates catastrophic forgetting of intrinsic coding capabilities. Experiments on general tool-use benchmarks (BFCL, tau^2-Bench) and code agent tasks (RebenchT, CodeCI, BIRD) demonstrate a win-win outcome: TDScaling improves both tool-use generalization and inherent coding proficiency. We plan to release the full codebase and the synthesized dataset (including 30,000+ tool clusters) upon publication.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mimic Intent, Not Just Trajectories](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08602v1)** | 2026-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While imitation learning (IL) has achieved impressive success in dexterous manipulation through generative modeling and pretraining, state-of-the-art approaches like Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models still struggle with adaptation to environmental changes and skill transfer. We argue this stems from mimicking raw trajectories without understanding the underlying intent. To address this, we propose explicitly disentangling behavior intent from execution details in end-2-end IL: \textit{``Mimic Intent, Not just Trajectories'' (MINT)}. We achieve this via \textit{multi-scale frequency-space tokenization}, which enforces a spectral decomposition of action chunk representation. We learn action tokens with a multi-scale coarse-to-fine structure, and force the coarsest token to capture low-frequency global structure and finer tokens to encode high-frequency details. This yields an abstract \textit{Intent token} that facilitates planning and transfer, and multi-scale \textit{Execution tokens} that enable precise adaptation to environmental dynamics. Building on this hierarchy, our policy generates trajectories through \textit{next-scale autoregression}, performing progressive \textit{intent-to-execution reasoning}, thus boosting learning efficiency and generalization. Crucially, this disentanglement enables \textit{one-shot transfer} of skills, by simply injecting the Intent token from a demonstration into the autoregressive generation process. Experiments on several manipulation benchmarks and on a real robot demonstrate state-of-the-art success rates, superior inference efficiency, robust generalization against disturbances, and effective one-shot transfer.</p></details> | Under review |
| **[Trajectory Stitching for Solving Inverse Problems with Flow-Based Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08538v1)** | 2026-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Flow-based generative models have emerged as powerful priors for solving inverse problems. One option is to directly optimize the initial latent code (noise), such that the flow output solves the inverse problem. However, this requires backpropagating through the entire generative trajectory, incurring high memory costs and numerical instability. We propose MS-Flow, which represents the trajectory as a sequence of intermediate latent states rather than a single initial code. By enforcing the flow dynamics locally and coupling segments through trajectory-matching penalties, MS-Flow alternates between updating intermediate latent states and enforcing consistency with observed data. This reduces memory consumption while improving reconstruction quality. We demonstrate the effectiveness of MS-Flow over existing methods on image recovery and inverse problems, including inpainting, super-resolution, and computed tomography.</p></details> |  |

Yet, analysis is difficult for non-expert users due to the incompleteness and complexity of AIS data. We present CLEAR, a knowledge-centric vessel trajectory analysis platform that aims to overcome these barriers. By leveraging the reasoning and generative capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), CLEAR transforms raw AIS data into complete, interpretable, and easily explorable vessel trajectories through a Structured Data-derived Knowledge Graph (SD-KG). As part of the demo, participants can configure parameters to automatically download and process AIS data, observe how trajectories are completed and annotated, inspect both raw and imputed segments together with their SD-KG evidence, and interactively explore the SD-KG through a dedicated graph viewer, gaining an intuitive and transparent understanding of vessel movements.</p></details> | <details><summary>4 pag...</summary><p>4 pages, and 5 Figures</p></details> |

This paper proposes a structured heuristic recovery control law that jointly commands steering and tractive force for a generalized single-track Ackermann vehicle model. The formulation explicitly accounts for time-varying longitudinal velocity in the lateral-yaw dynamics and retains nonlinear steering-coupled interaction terms that are commonly simplified in the literature. Unlike approaches that assume constant longitudinal speed, the proposed design targets the transient post-impact regime where speed variations and nonlinear coupling significantly influence recovery. The method is evaluated in simulation on the proposed generalized single-track model and a standard 3DOF single-track reference model in MATLAB, demonstrating consistent post-collision restoration behaviour across representative initial post-impact conditions.</p></details> | 10 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Is Flow Matching Just Trajectory Replay for Sequential Data?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08318v1)** | 2026-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Flow matching (FM) is increasingly used for time-series generation, but it is not well understood whether it learns a general dynamical structure or simply performs an effective "trajectory replay". We study this question by deriving the velocity field targeted by the empirical FM objective on sequential data, in the limit of perfect function approximation. For the Gaussian conditional paths commonly used in practice, we show that the implied sampler is an ODE whose dynamics constitutes a nonparametric, memory-augmented continuous-time dynamical system. The optimal field admits a closed-form expression as a similarity-weighted mixture of instantaneous velocities induced by past transitions, making the dataset dependence explicit and interpretable. This perspective positions neural FM models trained by stochastic optimization as parametric surrogates of an ideal nonparametric solution. Using the structure of the optimal field, we study sampling and approximation schemes that improve the efficiency and numerical robustness of ODE-based generation. On nonlinear dynamical system benchmarks, the resulting closed-form sampler yields strong probabilistic forecasts directly from historical transitions, without training.</p></details> | 51 pages |

The optimization performance largely depends on the quality of initial trajectories. However, the selection of a high-quality initial trajectory is non-trivial and requires a considerable time budget due to the extremely large space of the solution trajectories and the lack of prior knowledge about task constraints in configuration space. To alleviate the issue, we present a learning-based initial trajectory generation method that generates high-quality initial trajectories in a short time budget by adopting example-guided reinforcement learning. In addition, we suggest a null-space projected imitation reward to consider null-space constraints by efficiently learning kinematically feasible motion captured in expert demonstrations. Our statistical evaluation in simulation shows the improved optimality, efficiency, and applicability of TO when we plug in our method's output, compared with three other baselines. We also show the performance improvement and feasibility via real-world experiments with a seven-degree-of-freedom manipulator.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICRA 2023.

However, the high collection costs and ever-increasing privacy concerns prevent us from accessing large-scale LBSN trajectory data. The recent advances in synthetic data generation provide us with a new opportunity to achieve this, which utilizes generative AI to generate synthetic data that preserves the characteristics of real data while ensuring privacy protection. However, generating synthetic LBSN check-in trajectories remains challenging due to their spatially discrete, temporally irregular nature and the complex spatio-temporal patterns caused by sparse activities and uncertain human mobility. To address this challenge, we propose GeoGen, a two-stage coarse-to-fine framework for large-scale LBSN check-in trajectory generation. In the first stage, we reconstruct spatially continuous, temporally regular latent movement sequences from the original LBSN check-in trajectories and then design a Sparsity-aware Spatio-temporal Diffusion model (S$^2$TDiff) with an efficient denosing network to learn their underlying behavioral patterns. In the second stage, we design Coarse2FineNet, a Transformer-based Seq2Seq architecture equipped with a dynamic context fusion mechanism in the encoder and a multi-task hybrid-head decoder, which generates fine-grained LBSN trajectories based on coarse-grained latent movement sequences by modeling semantic relevance and behavioral uncertainty. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets show that GeoGen excels state-of-the-art models for both fidelity and utility evaluation, e.g., it increases over 69% and 55% in distance and radius metrics on the FS-TKY dataset.</p></details> |  |
| **[R-Stitch: Dynamic Trajectory Stitching for Efficient Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17307v6)** | 2026-02-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Chain-of-thought (CoT) enhances the problem-solving ability of large language models (LLMs) but incurs substantial inference cost due to long autoregressive trajectories. Existing acceleration strategies either shorten traces via early stopping or compression, or adopt speculative decoding with a smaller model. However, speculative decoding provides limited gains when model agreement is low and rigidly enforces token-level consistency, overlooking the observation that some smaller models, when correct, produce significantly more concise reasoning traces that could reduce inference length. We introduce R-Stitch, a training-free hybrid decoding framework that leverages token-level entropy as an uncertainty proxy to delegate computation between a small language model (SLM) and an LLM. Our analysis shows that high-entropy tokens are more likely to induce errors, motivating an entropy-guided routing strategy that lets the SLM efficiently handle low-entropy tokens while delegating uncertain ones to the LLM, thereby avoiding full rollbacks and preserving answer quality. We further extend this design with R-Stitch$^{+}$, which learns an adaptive routing policy to adjust the token budget dynamically beyond fixed thresholds. By jointly reducing per-token decoding complexity and the number of generated tokens, our method achieves substantial acceleration with negligible accuracy loss. Concretely, it attains peak speedups of 3.00$\times$ on DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B, 3.85$\times$ on 14B, and 4.10$\times$ on QWQ-32B while maintaining accuracy comparable to full LLM decoding. Moreover, it naturally enables adaptive efficiency--accuracy trade-offs that can be tailored to diverse computational budgets without retraining.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trajectory-Aware Multi-RIS Activation and Configuration: A Riemannian Diffusion Method](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07937v1)** | 2026-02-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) offer a low-cost, energy-efficient means for enhancing wireless coverage. Yet, their inherently programmable reflections may unintentionally amplify interference, particularly in large-scale, multi-RIS-enabled mobile communication scenarios where dense user mobility and frequent line-of-sight overlaps can severely degrade the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR). To address this challenge, this paper presents a novel generative multi-RIS control framework that jointly optimizes the ON/OFF activation patterns of multiple RISs in the smart wireless environment and the phase configurations of the activated RISs based on predictions of multi-user trajectories and interference patterns. We specially design a long short-term memory (LSTM) artificial neural network, enriched with speed and heading features, to forecast multi-user trajectories, thereby enabling reconstruction of future channel state information. To overcome the highly nonconvex nature of the multi-RIS control problem, we develop a Riemannian diffusion model on the torus to generate geometry-consistent phase-configuration, where the reverse diffusion process is dynamically guided by reinforcement learning. We then rigorously derive the optimal ON/OFF states of the metasurfaces by comparing predicted achievable rates under RIS activation and deactivation conditions. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves up to 30\% SINR improvement over learning-based control and up to 44\% gain compared with the RIS always-on scheme, while consistently outperforming state-of-the-art baselines across different transmit powers, RIS configurations, and interference densities.</p></details> |  |

Our approach leverages a 4-dimensional spatio-temporal planner, integrated with vision-based Safe Flight Corridor (SFC) generation and trajectory optimization. Unlike prior methods that rely on map fusion, our framework is mapless, enabling collision avoidance directly from perception while reducing computational overhead. Dynamic obstacles are detected and tracked using a vision-based object segmentation and tracking pipeline, allowing robust classification of static versus dynamic elements in the scene. To further enhance robustness, we introduce a backup planning module that reactively avoids dynamic obstacles when no direct path to the goal is available, mitigating the risk of collisions during deadlock situations. We validate our method extensively in both simulation and real-world hardware experiments, and benchmark it against state-of-the-art approaches, showing significant advantages for reactive UAV navigation in dynamic, unknown environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at ICRA 2026</p></details> |

To address this, a surge of deep generative models has recently emerged to learn dynamics at coarsened timesteps for efficient trajectory generation, yet they either generalize poorly across systems or, due to limited molecular diversity of trajectory data, fail to fully exploit structural information to improve generative fidelity. Here, we present the Pretrained Variational Bridge (PVB) in an encoder-decoder fashion, which maps the initial structure into a noised latent space and transports it toward stage-specific targets through augmented bridge matching. This unifies training on both single-structure and paired trajectory data, enabling consistent use of cross-domain structural knowledge across training stages. Moreover, for protein-ligand complexes, we further introduce a reinforcement learning-based optimization via adjoint matching that speeds progression toward the holo state, which supports efficient post-optimization of docking poses. Experiments on proteins and protein-ligand complexes demonstrate that PVB faithfully reproduces thermodynamic and kinetic observables from MD while delivering stable and efficient generative dynamics.</p></details> | <details><summary>The F...</summary><p>The Fourteenth International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR 2026)</p></details> |

In this work, we present RAPiD, a deterministic policy extraction framework that distills a pretrained diffusion-based planner into an efficient policy while eliminating diffusion sampling. Using score-regularized policy optimization, we leverage the score function of a pre-trained diffusion planner as a behavior prior to regularize policy learning. To promote safety and passenger comfort, the policy is optimized using a critic trained to imitate a predictive driver controller, providing dense, safety-focused supervision beyond conventional imitation learning. Evaluations demonstrate that RAPiD achieves competitive performance on closed-loop nuPlan scenarios with an 8x speedup over diffusion baselines, while achieving state-of-the-art generalization among learning-based planners on the interPlan benchmark.

| **[Probing Graph Neural Network Activation Patterns Through Graph Topology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21092v1)** | 2026-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Curvature notions on graphs provide a theoretical description of graph topology, highlighting bottlenecks and denser connected regions. Artifacts of the message passing paradigm in Graph Neural Networks, such as oversmoothing and oversquashing, have been attributed to these regions. However, it remains unclear how the topology of a graph interacts with the learned preferences of GNNs. Through Massive Activations, which correspond to extreme edge activation values in Graph Transformers, we probe this correspondence. Our findings on synthetic graphs and molecular benchmarks reveal that MAs do not preferentially concentrate on curvature extremes, despite their theoretical link to information flow. On the Long Range Graph Benchmark, we identify a systemic \textit{curvature shift}: global attention mechanisms exacerbate topological bottlenecks, drastically increasing the prevalence of negative curvature. Our work reframes curvature as a diagnostic probe for understanding when and why graph learning fails.</p></details> |  |

Spectral convergence of sampled graphs to graphons induces convergence of the corresponding neural operators, enabling transferability analyses of graph neural networks (GNNs). This paper develops a unified spectral framework that brings together convergence results under different assumptions on the underlying graphon, including no regularity, global Lipschitz continuity, and piecewise-Lipschitz continuity. The framework places these results in a common operator setting, enabling direct comparison of their assumptions, convergence rates, and tradeoffs. We further illustrate the empirical tightness of these rates on synthetic and real-world graphs.</p></details> |  |
| **[CITED: A Decision Boundary-Aware Signature for GNNs Towards Model Extraction Defense](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20418v1)** | 2026-02-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) have demonstrated superior performance in various applications, such as recommendation systems and financial risk management. However, deploying large-scale GNN models locally is particularly challenging for users, as it requires significant computational resources and extensive property data. Consequently, Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS) has become increasingly popular, offering a convenient way to deploy and access various models, including GNNs. However, an emerging threat known as Model Extraction Attacks (MEAs) presents significant risks, as adversaries can readily obtain surrogate GNN models exhibiting similar functionality. Specifically, attackers repeatedly query the target model using subgraph inputs to collect corresponding responses. These input-output pairs are subsequently utilized to train their own surrogate models at minimal cost. Many techniques have been proposed to defend against MEAs, but most are limited to specific output levels (e.g., embedding or label) and suffer from inherent technical drawbacks. To address these limitations, we propose a novel ownership verification framework CITED which is a first-of-its-kind method to achieve ownership verification on both embedding and label levels. Moreover, CITED is a novel signature-based method that neither harms downstream performance nor introduces auxiliary models that reduce efficiency, while still outperforming all watermarking and fingerprinting approaches. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our CITED framework. Code is available at: https://github.com/LabRAI/CITED.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond Message Passing: A Symbolic Alternative for Expressive and Interpretable Graph Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16947v2)** | 2026-02-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become essential in high-stakes domains such as drug discovery, yet their black-box nature remains a significant barrier to trustworthiness. While self-explainable GNNs attempt to bridge this gap, they often rely on standard message-passing backbones that inherit fundamental limitations, including the 1-Weisfeiler-Lehman (1-WL) expressivity barrier and a lack of fine-grained interpretability. To address these challenges, we propose SymGraph, a symbolic framework designed to transcend these constraints. By replacing continuous message passing with discrete structural hashing and topological role-based aggregation, our architecture theoretically surpasses the 1-WL barrier, achieving superior expressiveness without the overhead of differentiable optimization. Extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that SymGraph achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing self-explainable GNNs. Notably, SymGraph delivers 10x to 100x speedups in training time using only CPU execution. Furthermore, SymGraph generates rules with superior semantic granularity compared to existing rule-based methods, offering great potential for scientific discovery and explainable AI.</p></details> | 23 pages, 9 pages |

A Benchmark for Long-Range Graph Propagation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17762v2)** | 2026-02-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Effectively capturing long-range interactions remains a fundamental yet unresolved challenge in graph neural network (GNN) research, critical for applications across diverse fields of science. To systematically address this, we introduce ECHO (Evaluating Communication over long HOps), a novel benchmark specifically designed to rigorously assess the capabilities of GNNs in handling very long-range graph propagation. ECHO includes three synthetic graph tasks, namely single-source shortest paths, node eccentricity, and graph diameter, each constructed over diverse and structurally challenging topologies intentionally designed to introduce significant information bottlenecks. ECHO also includes two real-world datasets, ECHO-Charge and ECHO-Energy, which define chemically grounded benchmarks for predicting atomic partial charges and molecular total energies, respectively, with reference computations obtained at the density functional theory (DFT) level. Both tasks inherently depend on capturing complex long-range molecular interactions. Our extensive benchmarking of popular GNN architectures reveals clear performance gaps, emphasizing the difficulty of true long-range propagation and highlighting design choices capable of overcoming inherent limitations. ECHO thereby sets a new standard for evaluating long-range information propagation, also providing a compelling example for its need in AI for science.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICLR 2026 ( https://openreview.net/forum?id=DgkWFPZMPp )</p></details> |
| **[A Secure and Private Distributed Bayesian Federated Learning Design](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20003v1)** | 2026-02-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Distributed Federated Learning (DFL) enables decentralized model training across large-scale systems without a central parameter server. However, DFL faces three critical challenges: privacy leakage from honest-but-curious neighbors, slow convergence due to the lack of central coordination, and vulnerability to Byzantine adversaries aiming to degrade model accuracy. To address these issues, we propose a novel DFL framework that integrates Byzantine robustness, privacy preservation, and convergence acceleration. Within this framework, each device trains a local model using a Bayesian approach and independently selects an optimal subset of neighbors for posterior exchange. We formulate this neighbor selection as an optimization problem to minimize the global loss function under security and privacy constraints. Solving this problem is challenging because devices only possess partial network information, and the complex coupling between topology, security, and convergence remains unclear. To bridge this gap, we first analytically characterize the trade-offs between dynamic connectivity, Byzantine detection, privacy levels, and convergence speed. Leveraging these insights, we develop a fully distributed Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithm. This approach enables devices to make autonomous connection decisions based on local observations. Simulation results demonstrate that our method achieves superior robustness and efficiency with significantly lower overhead compared to traditional security and privacy schemes.</p></details> | 14 pages, 9 figures |

We introduce SME-HGT, a Heterogeneous Graph Transformer framework that predicts which SBIR Phase I awardees will advance to Phase II funding using exclusively public data. We construct a heterogeneous graph with 32,268 company nodes, 124 research topic nodes, and 13 government agency nodes connected by approximately 99,000 edges across three semantic relation types. SME-HGT achieves an AUPRC of 0.621 0.003 on a temporally-split test set, outperforming an MLP baseline (0.590 0.002) and R-GCN (0.608 0.013) across five random seeds. At a screening depth of 100 companies, SME-HGT attains 89.6% precision with a 2.14 lift over random selection. Our temporal evaluation protocol prevents information leakage, and our reliance on public data ensures reproducibility. These results demonstrate that relational structure among firms, research topics, and funding agencies provides meaningful signal for SME potential assessment, with implications for policymakers and early-stage investors.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods still struggle with: 1) weak incorporation of temporal constraints in question representation, causing biased reasoning; 2) limited ability to perform explicit multi-hop reasoning; and 3) suboptimal fusion of language and graph representations. We propose a novel framework with temporal-aware question encoding, multi-hop graph reasoning, and multi-view heterogeneous information fusion. Specifically, our approach introduces: 1) a constraint-aware question representation that combines semantic cues from language models with temporal entity dynamics; 2) a temporal-aware graph neural network for explicit multi-hop reasoning via time-aware message passing; and 3) a multi-view attention mechanism for more effective fusion of question context and temporal graph knowledge. Experiments on multiple TKGQA benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements over multiple baselines.</p></details> | 6pages |

For GNNs, however, message passing is topology-dependent and sensitive to misalignment, making direct parameter-space merging unreliable. To bridge this gap, we introduce H-GRAMA (Heterogeneous Graph Routing and Message Alignment), a training-free framework that lifts merging from parameter space to operator space. We formalize Universal Message Passing Mixture (UMPM), a shared operator family that expresses heterogeneous GNN layers in a common functional language. H-GRAMA enables cross-architecture GNN merging (e.g., GCN to GAT) without retraining, retaining high specialist accuracy in most cases in compatible depth settings and achieving inference speedups of 1.2x to 1.9x over ensembles.</p></details> |  |
| **[CTS-Bench: Benchmarking Graph Coarsening Trade-offs for GNNs in Clock Tree Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19330v1)** | 2026-02-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are increasingly explored for physical design analysis in Electronic Design Automation, particularly for modeling Clock Tree Synthesis behavior such as clock skew and buffering complexity. However, practical deployment remains limited due to the prohibitive memory and runtime cost of operating on raw gate-level netlists. Graph coarsening is commonly used to improve scalability, yet its impact on CTS-critical learning objectives is not well characterized. This paper introduces CTS-Bench, a benchmark suite for systematically evaluating the trade-offs between graph coarsening, prediction accuracy, and computational efficiency in GNN-based CTS analysis. CTS-Bench consists of 4,860 converged physical design solutions spanning five architectures and provides paired raw gate-level and clustered graph representations derived from post-placement designs. Using clock skew prediction as a representative CTS task, we demonstrate a clear accuracy-efficiency trade-off. While graph coarsening reduces GPU memory usage by up to 17.2x and accelerates training by up to 3x, it also removes structural information essential for modeling clock distribution, frequently resulting in negative $R^2$ scores under zero-shot evaluation. Our findings indicate that generic graph clustering techniques can fundamentally compromise CTS learning objectives, even when global physical metrics remain unchanged. CTS-Bench enables principled evaluation of CTS-aware graph coarsening strategies, supports benchmarking of GNN architectures and accelerators under realistic physical design constraints, and provides a foundation for developing learning-assisted CTS analysis and optimization techniques.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ML Bench'26 ASPLOS</p></details> |
| **[Graph Neural Network Assisted Genetic Algorithm for Structural Dynamic Response and Parameter Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22839v3)** | 2026-02-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The optimization of structural parameters, such as mass(m), stiffness(k), and damping coefficient(c), is critical for designing efficient, resilient, and stable structures. Conventional numerical approaches, including Finite Element Method (FEM) and Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations, provide high-fidelity results but are computationally expensive for iterative optimization tasks, as each evaluation requires solving the governing equations for every parameter combination. This study proposes a hybrid data-driven framework that integrates a Graph Neural Network (GNN) surrogate model with a Genetic Algorithm (GA) optimizer to overcome these challenges. The GNN is trained to accurately learn the nonlinear mapping between structural parameters and dynamic displacement responses, enabling rapid predictions without repeatedly solving the system equations. A dataset of single-degree-of-freedom (SDOF) system responses is generated using the Newmark Beta method across diverse mass, stiffness, and damping configurations. The GA then searches for globally optimal parameter sets by minimizing predicted displacements and enhancing dynamic stability. Results demonstrate that the GNN and GA framework achieves strong convergence, robust generalization, and significantly reduced computational cost compared to conventional simulations. This approach highlights the effectiveness of combining machine learning surrogates with evolutionary optimization for automated and intelligent structural design.</p></details> | 13 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Towards A Universal Graph Structural Encoder](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10917v2)** | 2026-02-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in large-scale pre-training have shown the potential to learn generalizable representations for downstream tasks. In the graph domain, however, capturing and transferring structural information across different graph domains remains challenging, primarily due to the inherent differences in graph topological patterns across various contexts. For example, a social network's structure is fundamentally different from that of a product co-purchase graph. Additionally, most existing models struggle to capture the rich topological complexity of graph structures, leading to inadequate exploration of the graph embedding space. To address these challenges, we propose GFSE, a universal pre-trained graph encoder designed to capture transferable structural patterns across diverse domains such as the web graph, social networks, and citation networks. GFSE is the first cross-domain graph structural encoder pre-trained with multiple self-supervised learning objectives. Built on a Graph Transformer, GFSE incorporates attention mechanisms informed by graph structural information, enabling it to encode intricate multi-level and fine-grained topological features within complex graph structures. The pre-trained GFSE produces generic and theoretically expressive positional and structural encoding for graphs, which can be seamlessly integrated with various downstream graph feature encoders, including graph neural networks for vectorized features and Large Language Models (LLMs) for text-attributed graphs. Comprehensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate GFSE's capability to significantly enhance the model's performance while requiring substantially less task-specific fine-tuning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Revisiting Node Affinity Prediction in Temporal Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06940v3)** | 2026-02-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Node affinity prediction is a common task that is widely used in temporal graph learning with applications in social and financial networks, recommender systems, and more. Recent works have addressed this task by adapting state-of-the-art dynamic link property prediction models to node affinity prediction. However, simple heuristics, such as Persistent Forecast or Moving Average, outperform these models. In this work, we analyze the challenges in training current Temporal Graph Neural Networks for node affinity prediction and suggest appropriate solutions. Combining the solutions, we develop NAViS - Node Affinity prediction model using Virtual State, by exploiting the equivalence between heuristics and state space models. While promising, training NAViS is non-trivial. Therefore, we further introduce a novel loss function for node affinity prediction. We evaluate NAViS on TGB and show that it outperforms the state-of-the-art, including heuristics.

| **[Covariance Density Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11139v2)** | 2026-02-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks have re-defined how we model and predict on network data but there lacks a consensus on choosing the correct underlying graph structure on which to model signals. CoVariance Neural Networks (VNN) address this issue by using the sample covariance matrix as a Graph Shift Operator (GSO). Here, we improve on the performance of VNNs by constructing a Density Matrix where we consider the sample Covariance matrix as a quasi-Hamiltonian of the system in the space of random variables. Crucially, using this density matrix as the GSO allows components of the data to be extracted at different scales, allowing enhanced discriminability and performance. We show that this approach allows explicit control of the stability-discriminability trade-off of the network, provides enhanced robustness to noise compared to VNNs, and outperforms them in useful real-life applications where the underlying covariance matrix is informative. In particular, we show that our model can achieve strong performance in subject-independent Brain Computer Interface EEG motor imagery classification, outperforming EEGnet while being faster. This shows how covariance density neural networks provide a basis for the notoriously difficult task of transferability of BCIs when evaluated on unseen individuals.</p></details> |  |
| **[GEDAN: Learning the Edit Costs for Graph Edit Distance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03111v3)** | 2026-02-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Edit Distance (GED) is defined as the minimum cost transformation of one graph into another and is a widely adopted metric for measuring the dissimilarity between graphs. The major problem of GED is that its computation is NP-hard, which has in turn led to the development of various approximation methods, including approaches based on neural networks (NN). However, most NN methods assume a unit cost for edit operations -- a restrictive and often unrealistic simplification, since topological and functional distances rarely coincide in real-world data. In this paper, we propose a fully end-to-end Graph Neural Network framework for learning the edit costs for GED, at a fine-grained level, aligning topological and task-specific similarity. Our method combines an unsupervised self-organizing mechanism for GED approximation with a Generalized Additive Model that flexibly learns contextualized edit costs. Experiments demonstrate that our approach overcomes the limitations of non-end-to-end methods, yielding directly interpretable graph matchings, uncovering meaningful structures in complex graphs, and showing strong applicability to domains such as molecular analysis.</p></details> |  |
| **[Revisiting Graph Neural Networks for Graph-level Tasks: Taxonomy, Empirical Study, and Future Directions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00773v2)** | 2026-02-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graphs are fundamental data structures for modeling complex interactions in domains such as social networks, molecular structures, and biological systems. Graph-level tasks, which involve predicting properties or labels for entire graphs, are crucial for applications like molecular property prediction and subgraph counting. While Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown significant promise for these tasks, their evaluations are often limited by narrow datasets, task coverage, and inconsistent experimental setups, hindering their generalizability. In this paper, we present a comprehensive experimental study of GNNs on graph-level tasks, systematically categorizing them into five types: node-based, hierarchical pooling-based, subgraph-based, graph learning-based, and self-supervised learning-based GNNs. To address these challenges, we propose a unified evaluation framework OpenGLT for graph-level GNNs. OpenGLT standardizes the evaluation process across diverse datasets, multiple graph tasks (e.g., classification and regression), and real-world scenarios, including noisy, imbalanced, and few-shot graphs. Extensive experiments are conducted on 16 baseline models across five categories, evaluated on 13 graph classification and 13 graph regression datasets. These experiments provide comprehensive insights into the strengths and weaknesses of existing GNN architectures.</p></details> |  |
| **[E2E-GRec: An End-to-End Joint Training Framework for Graph Neural Networks and Recommender Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20564v2)** | 2026-02-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful tools for modeling graph-structured data and have been widely used in recommender systems, such as for capturing complex user-item and item-item relations. However, most industrial deployments adopt a two-stage pipeline: GNNs are first pre-trained offline to generate node embeddings, which are then used as static features for downstream recommender systems. This decoupled paradigm leads to two key limitations: (1) high computational overhead, since large-scale GNN inference must be repeatedly executed to refresh embeddings; and (2) lack of joint optimization, as the gradient from the recommender system cannot directly influence the GNN learning process, causing the GNN to be suboptimally informative for the recommendation task. In this paper, we propose E2E-GRec, a novel end-to-end training framework that unifies GNN training with the recommender system. Our framework is characterized by three key components: (i) efficient subgraph sampling from a large-scale cross-domain heterogeneous graph to ensure training scalability and efficiency; (ii) a Graph Feature Auto-Encoder (GFAE) serving as an auxiliary self-supervised task to guide the GNN to learn structurally meaningful embeddings; and (iii) a two-level feature fusion mechanism combined with Gradnorm-based dynamic loss balancing, which stabilizes graph-aware multi-task end-to-end training. Extensive offline evaluations, online A/B tests (e.g., a +0.133% relative improvement in stay duration, a 0.3171% reduction in the average number of videos a user skips) on large-scale production data, together with theoretical analysis, demonstrate that E2E-GRec consistently surpasses traditional approaches, yielding significant gains across multiple recommendation metrics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph Neural Networks Powered by Encoder Embedding for Improved Node Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11732v2)** | 2026-02-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as a powerful framework for a wide range of node-level graph learning tasks. However, their performance typically depends on random or minimally informed initial feature representations, where poor initialization can lead to slower convergence and increased training instability. In this paper, we address this limitation by leveraging a statistically grounded one-hot graph encoder embedding (GEE) as a high-quality, structure-aware initialization for node features. Integrating GEE into standard GNNs yields the GEE-powered GNN (GG) framework. Across extensive simulations and real-world benchmarks, GG provides consistent and substantial performance gains in both unsupervised and supervised settings. For node classification, we further introduce GG-C, which concatenates the outputs of GG and GEE and outperforms competing methods, achieving roughly 10-50% accuracy improvements across most datasets. These results demonstrate the importance of principled, structure-aware initialization for improving the efficiency, stability, and overall performance of graph neural network architecture, enabling models to better exploit graph topology from the outset.</p></details> |  |

Graph Neural Network(GNN), is proven to be an effective KG embedding technique that enables various downstream tasks like link prediction, node classification, and graph classification. The focus of research in both KG embedding and GNNs has been mostly oriented towards simple graphs with binary relations. However, real-world knowledge bases have a significant share of complex and n-ary facts that cannot be represented by binary edges. More specifically, real-world knowledge bases are often a mix of two types of n-ary facts - (i) that require hyperedges and (ii) that require hyper-relational edges. Though there are research efforts catering to these n-ary fact types, they are pursued independently for each type. We propose $H$yper$E$dge $H$yper-$R$elational edge $GNN$(HEHRGNN), a unified embedding model for n-ary relational KGs with both hyperedges and hyper-relational edges. The two main components of the model are i)HEHR unified fact representation format, and ii)HEHRGNN encoder, a GNN-based encoder with a novel message propagation model capable of capturing complex graph structures comprising both hyperedges and hyper-relational edges. The experimental results of HEHRGNN on link prediction tasks show its effectiveness as a unified embedding model, with inductive prediction capability, for link prediction across real-world datasets having different types of n-ary facts. The model also shows improved link prediction performance over baseline models for hyperedge and hyper-relational datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>38 Pa...</summary><p>38 Pages paper and 1 highlights page, 9 figures, 10 tables, Submitted to Elsevier Knowledge-Based Systems journal</p></details> |
| **[Are We Measuring Oversmoothing in Graph Neural Networks Correctly?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04591v4)** | 2026-02-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Oversmoothing is a fundamental challenge in graph neural networks (GNNs): as the number of layers increases, node embeddings become increasingly similar, and model performance drops sharply. Traditionally, oversmoothing has been quantified using metrics that measure the similarity of neighbouring node features, such as the Dirichlet energy. We argue that these metrics have critical limitations and fail to reliably capture oversmoothing in realistic scenarios. For instance, they provide meaningful insights only for very deep networks, while typical GNNs show a performance drop already with as few as 10 layers. As an alternative, we propose measuring oversmoothing by examining the numerical or effective rank of the feature representations. We provide extensive numerical evaluation across diverse graph architectures and datasets to show that rank-based metrics consistently capture oversmoothing, whereas energy-based metrics often fail. Notably, we reveal that drops in the rank align closely with performance degradation, even in scenarios where energy metrics remain unchanged. Along with the experimental evaluation, we provide theoretical support for this approach, clarifying why Dirichlet-like measures may fail to capture performance drop and proving that the numerical rank of feature representations collapses to one for a broad family of GNN architectures.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted into ICLR 2026</p></details> |
| **[L2G-Net: Local to Global Spectral Graph Neural Networks via Cauchy Factorizations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18837v1)** | 2026-02-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite their theoretical advantages, spectral methods based on the graph Fourier transform (GFT) are seldom used in graph neural networks (GNNs) due to the cost of computing the eigenbasis and the lack of vertex-domain locality in spectral representations. As a result, most GNNs rely on local approximations such as polynomial Laplacian filters or message passing, which limit their ability to model long-range dependencies. In this paper, we introduce a novel factorization of the GFT into operators acting on subgraphs, which are then combined via a sequence of Cauchy matrices. We use this factorization to propose a new class of spectral GNNs, which we term L2G-Net (Local-to-Global Net). Unlike existing spectral methods, which are either fully global (when they use the GFT) or local (when they use polynomial filters), L2G-Net operates by processing the spectral representations of subgraphs and then combining them via structured matrices. Our algorithm avoids full eigendecompositions, exploiting graph topology to construct the factorization with quadratic complexity in the number of nodes, scaled by the subgraph interface size. Experiments on benchmarks stressing non-local dependencies show that L2G-Net outperforms existing spectral techniques and is competitive with the state-of-the-art with orders of magnitude fewer learnable parameters.</p></details> |  |

Traditional approaches based on manual curation and literature review are labour-intensive and not scalable, prompting the use of machine learning on large biomedical data. In particular, graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown promise for modelling complex biological relationships. To address limitations in existing models, we propose GLaDiGAtor (Graph Learning-bAsed DIsease-Gene AssociaTiOn pRediction), a novel GNN framework with an encoder-decoder architecture for disease-gene association prediction. GLaDiGAtor constructs a heterogeneous biological graph integrating gene-gene, disease-disease, and gene-disease interactions from curated databases, and enriches each node with contextual features from well-known language models (ProtT5 for protein sequences and BioBERT for disease text). In evaluations, our model achieves superior predictive accuracy and generalisation, outperforming 14 existing methods. Literature-supported case studies confirm the biological relevance of high-confidence novel predictions, highlighting GLaDiGAtor's potential to discover candidate disease genes. These results underscore the power of graph convolutional networks in biomedical informatics and may ultimately facilitate drug discovery by revealing new gene-disease links.

In this work, we introduce several novel concepts and capabilities to address obstacles faced by machine-assisted theorem proving. We first present a set of \textbf{atomic tactics}, a small finite set of tactics capable of proving any provable statement in Lean. We then introduce a \textbf{transposing atomization} algorithm which turns arbitrary proof expressions into a series of atomic tactics. We next introduce the \textbf{ExprGraph} data structure, which provides a succinct representation for Lean expressions. Finally, we present the \textbf{Nazrin Prover}, a graph neural network-based theorem proving agent using atomic tactics and ExprGraph. Nazrin circumvents many challenges faced by existing proving agents by exclusively dispatching atomic tactics, and it is robust enough to both train and evaluate on consumer-grade hardware. We demonstrate the potential of tools like Nazrin using theorems from Lean's standard library and from Mathlib.</p></details> | 16 pages, 10 figures |

Traditional methods often require prior knowledge and are susceptible to external disturbances. Learning-driven alternatives, while promising, frequently struggle with the scarcity of training data and fall short in generalization. To address these challenges, we propose Depth-PC, a novel visual servoing framework that leverages decoupled simulation-based training from real-world inference, achieving zero-shot Sim2Real transfer for servo tasks. To exploit spatial and geometric information of depth and point cloud features, we introduce cross-modal feature fusion, a first in servo tasks, followed by a dedicated Graph Neural Network to establish keypoint correspondences. Through simulation and real-world experiments, our approach demonstrates superior convergence basin and accuracy compared to SOTA methods, fulfilling the requirements for robotic servo tasks while enabling zero-shot Sim2Real transfer. In addition to the enhancements achieved with our proposed framework, we have also demonstrated the effectiveness of cross-modality feature fusion within the realm of servo tasks.

| **[Mamba-Based Graph Convolutional Networks: Tackling Over-smoothing with Selective State Space](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15461v3)** | 2026-02-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown great success in various graph-based learning tasks. However, it often faces the issue of over-smoothing as the model depth increases, which causes all node representations to converge to a single value and become indistinguishable. This issue stems from the inherent limitations of GNNs, which struggle to distinguish the importance of information from different neighborhoods. In this paper, we introduce MbaGCN, a novel graph convolutional architecture that draws inspiration from the Mamba paradigm-originally designed for sequence modeling. MbaGCN presents a new backbone for GNNs, consisting of three key components: the Message Aggregation Layer, the Selective State Space Transition Layer, and the Node State Prediction Layer. These components work in tandem to adaptively aggregate neighborhood information, providing greater flexibility and scalability for deep GNN models. While MbaGCN may not consistently outperform all existing methods on each dataset, it provides a foundational framework that demonstrates the effective integration of the Mamba paradigm into graph representation learning. Through extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that MbaGCN paves the way for future advancements in graph neural network research.</p></details> | 11 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Stuart-Landau Oscillatory Graph Neural Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08094v2)** | 2026-02-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Oscillatory Graph Neural Networks (OGNNs) are an emerging class of physics-inspired architectures designed to mitigate oversmoothing and vanishing gradient problems in deep GNNs. In this work, we introduce the Complex-Valued Stuart-Landau Graph Neural Network (SLGNN), a novel architecture grounded in Stuart-Landau oscillator dynamics. Stuart-Landau oscillators are canonical models of limit-cycle behavior near Hopf bifurcations, which are fundamental to synchronization theory and are widely used in e.g. neuroscience for mesoscopic brain modeling. Unlike harmonic oscillators and phase-only Kuramoto models, Stuart-Landau oscillators retain both amplitude and phase dynamics, enabling rich phenomena such as amplitude regulation and multistable synchronization. The proposed SLGNN generalizes existing phase-centric Kuramoto-based OGNNs by allowing node feature amplitudes to evolve dynamically according to Stuart-Landau dynamics, with explicit tunable hyperparameters (such as the Hopf-parameter and the coupling strength) providing additional control over the interplay between feature amplitudes and network structure. We conduct extensive experiments across node classification, graph classification, and graph regression tasks, demonstrating that SLGNN outperforms existing OGNNs and establishes a novel, expressive, and theoretically grounded framework for deep oscillatory architectures on graphs.</p></details> |  |

However, such claims risk being unsolid due to a lack of standard benchmarks on truly hard instances. From a statistical physics perspective, we propose new hard benchmarks based on random problems. We provide these benchmarks, along with performance results from both classical heuristics and GNNs. Our fair comparison shows that classical algorithms still outperform GNNs.

Standard GNNs are limited to performing aggregation over immediate neighbourhoods or over global read-outs. To increase their expressivity, recent attempts have been made to incorporate substructural information (e.g. cycle counts and subgraph properties). In this paper, we formalize this architectural trend by introducing Template GNNs (T-GNNs), a generalized framework where node features are updated by aggregating over valid template embeddings from a specified set of graph templates. We propose a corresponding logic, Graded template modal logic (GML(T)), and generalized notions of template-based bisimulation and WL algorithm. We establish an equivalence between the expressive power of T-GNNs and GML(T), and provide a unifying approach for analysing GNN expressivity: we show how standard AC-GNNs and its recent variants can be interpreted as instantiations of T-GNNs.</p></details> |  |

However, current PIGNNs still need accuracy improvements at parity speed; in particular, the soft constraint on the physics loss is inoperative at inference, which can deter operational adoption. We address this with PIGNN-Attn-LS, combining an edge-aware attention mechanism that explicitly encodes line physics via per-edge biases to form a fully differentiable knownoperator layer inside the computation graph, with a backtracking line-search-based globalized correction operator that restores an operative decrease criterion at inference. Training and testing use a realistic High-/Medium-Voltage scenario generator, with NR used only to construct reference states. On held-out HV cases consisting of 4-32-bus grids, PIGNN-Attn-LS achieves a test RMSE of 0.00033 p.u. in voltage and 0.08 deg in angle, outperforming the PIGNN-MLP baseline by 99.5% and 87.1%, respectively.

However, they are often limited by scarce experimental property data and lack thermodynamic consistency. As such, thermodynamics-informed ML, i.e., incorporating thermodynamic relations into the loss function as regularization term for training, has been proposed. We herein transfer the concept of thermodynamics-informed graph neural networks (GNNs) from the Gibbs-Duhem to the Clapeyron equation, predicting several pure component properties in a multi-task manner, namely: vapor pressure, liquid molar volume, vapor molar volume and enthalpy of vaporization. We find improved prediction accuracy of the Clapeyron-GNN compared to the single-task learning setting, and improved approximation of the Clapeyron equation compared to the purely data-driven multi-task learning setting. In fact, we observe the largest improvement in prediction accuracy for the properties with the lowest availability of data, making our model promising for practical application in data scarce scenarios of chemical engineering practice.</p></details> |  |

Non-invasive, in-vivo measurement of these quantities can only be performed using a select number of modalities that are not widely available, such as 4D flow magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In this work, we create a surrogate model for hemodynamic flow field estimation, powered by machine learning. We train graph neural networks that include priors about the underlying symmetries and physics, limiting the amount of data required for training. This allows us to train the model using moderately-sized, in-vivo 4D flow MRI datasets, instead of large in-silico datasets obtained by computational fluid dynamics (CFD), as is the current standard. We create an efficient, equivariant neural network by combining the popular PointNet++ architecture with group-steerable layers. To incorporate the physics-informed priors, we derive an efficient discretisation scheme for the involved differential operators. We perform extensive experiments in carotid arteries and show that our model can accurately estimate low-noise hemodynamic flow fields in the carotid artery. Moreover, we show how the learned relation between geometry and hemodynamic quantities transfers to 3D vascular models obtained using a different imaging modality than the training data. This shows that physics-informed graph neural networks can be trained using 4D flow MRI data to estimate blood flow in unseen carotid artery geometries.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in "Medical Image Analysis"</p></details> |

High-fidelity simulations are accurate but computationally costly, and despite recent advances, machine learning methods remain challenged by long-horizon temperature and gradient prediction. We propose a deep learning framework for predicting full temperature histories directly on meshes, conditioned on geometry and process parameters, while maintaining stability over thousands of time steps and generalizing across heterogeneous geometries. The framework adopts a temporal multiscale architecture composed of two coupled models operating at complementary time scales. Both models rely on a latent recurrent graph neural network to capture spatiotemporal dynamics on meshes, while a variational graph autoencoder provides a compact latent representation that reduces memory usage and improves training stability. Experiments on simulated powder bed fusion data demonstrate accurate and temporally stable long-horizon predictions across diverse geometries, outperforming existing baseline. Although evaluated in two dimensions, the framework is general and extensible to physics-driven systems with multiscale dynamics and to three-dimensional geometries.</p></details> |  |

Existing remedies such as graph transformers or rewiring typically incur high computational cost or require altering the graph structure. We introduce a Bakry-Emery graph Laplacian that integrates diffusion and advection through a learnable node-wise potential, inducing task-dependent propagation dynamics without modifying topology. This operator has a well-behaved spectral decomposition and acts as a drop-in replacement for standard Laplacians in spectral GNNs. Building on this insight, we develop mu-ChebNet, a spectral architecture that jointly learns the potential and Chebyshev filters, effectively bridging message-passing adaptivity and spectral efficiency. Our theoretical analysis shows how the potential modulates the spectrum, enabling control of key graph properties. Empirically, mu-ChebNet delivers consistent gains on synthetic long-range reasoning tasks, as well as real-world benchmarks, while offering an interpretable routing field that reveals how information flows through the graph. This establishes the Bakry-Emery Laplacian as a principled and efficient foundation for adaptive spectral graph learning.</p></details> |  |

Understanding and decoding cognitive brain states from fMRI depends on how functional interactions are represented. We propose an ensemble-based graph representation in which each edge weight encodes state evidence as the difference between posterior probabilities of two states, estimated by an ensemble of edge-wise probabilistic classifiers from simple pairwise time-series features. We evaluate the method on seven task-fMRI paradigms from the Human Connectome Project, performing binary classification within each paradigm. Using compact node summaries (mean incident edge weights) and logistic regression, we obtain average accuracies of 97.07-99.74 %. We further compare ensemble graphs with conventional correlation graphs using the same graph neural network classifier; ensemble graphs consistently yield higher accuracy (88.00-99.42 % vs 61.86-97.94 % across tasks). Because edge weights have a probabilistic, state-oriented interpretation, the representation supports connection- and region-level interpretability and can be extended to multiclass decoding, regression, other neuroimaging modalities, and clinical classification.</p></details> |  |

Yet, existing methods are unsuitable for routing on multigraphs, which feature multiple edges with distinct attributes between node pairs, despite their strong relevance in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose two graph neural network-based methods to address multi-objective routing on multigraphs. Our first approach operates directly on the multigraph by autoregressively selecting edges until a tour is completed. The second model, which is more scalable, first simplifies the multigraph via a learned pruning strategy and then performs autoregressive routing on the resulting simple graph. We evaluate both models empirically, across a wide range of problems and graph distributions, and demonstrate their competitive performance compared to strong heuristics and neural baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICLR 2026, Final Camera-Ready Version. 34 pages, 6 Figures</p></details> |
| **[Co-Evolution-Based Metal-Binding Residue Prediction with Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16189v2)** | 2026-02-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding protein-metal interactions is central to structural biology, with metal ions being vital for catalysis, stability, and signal transduction. Predicting metal-binding residues and metal types remains challenging due to the structural and evolutionary complexity of proteins. Conventional sequence- and structure-based methods often fail to capture co-evolutionary constraints that reflect how residues evolve together to maintain metal-binding functionality. Recent co-evolution-based methods capture part of this information, but still underutilize the complete co-evolved residue network. To address this limitation, we introduce the Metal-Binding Graph Neural Network (MBGNN), which leverages the complete co-evolved residue network to better capture complex dependencies within protein structures. Experimental results show that MBGNN substantially outperforms the state-of-the-art co-evolution-based method MetalNet2, achieving F1 score improvements of 2.5% for binding residue identification and 3.3% for metal type classification on the MetalNet2 dataset. Its superiority is further demonstrated on both the MetalNet2 and MIonSite datasets, where it outperforms two co-evolution-based and two sequence-based methods, achieving the highest mean F1 scores across both prediction tasks.

We demonstrate this capability on an instance of the CANOS-PF graph neural network model, as implemented by the PF$Δ$ benchmark library, operating on a 14-bus test grid. Generated adversarial points yield errors as large as 3.4 per-unit in reactive power and 0.08 per-unit in voltage magnitude. When minimizing the perturbation from a training point necessary to satisfy adversarial constraints, we find that the constraints can be met with as little as an 0.04 per-unit perturbation in voltage magnitude on a single bus. This work motivates the development of rigorous verification and robust training methods for neural network surrogate models of AC power flow.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph-Neural Multi-Agent Coordination for Distributed Access-Point Selection in Cell-Free Massive MIMO](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17954v1)** | 2026-02-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cell-free massive MIMO (CFmMIMO) systems require scalable and reliable distributed coordination mechanisms to operate under stringent communication and latency constraints. A central challenge is the Access Point Selection (APS) problem, which seeks to determine the subset of serving Access Points (APs) for each User Equipment (UE) that can satisfy UEs' Spectral Efficiency (SE) requirements while minimizing network power consumption. We introduce APS-GNN, a scalable distributed multi-agent learning framework that decomposes APS into agents operating at the granularity of individual AP-UE connections. Agents coordinate via local observation exchange over a novel Graph Neural Network (GNN) architecture and share parameters to reuse their knowledge and experience. APS-GNN adopts a constrained reinforcement learning approach to provide agents with explicit observability of APS' conflicting objectives, treating SE satisfaction as a cost and power reduction as a reward. Both signals are defined locally, facilitating effective credit assignment and scalable coordination in large networks. To further improve training stability and exploration efficiency, the policy is initialized via supervised imitation learning from a heuristic APS baseline. We develop a realistic CFmMIMO simulator and demonstrate that APS-GNN delivers the target SE while activating 50-70% fewer APs than heuristic and centralized Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) baselines in different evaluation scenarios. Moreover, APS-GNN achieves one to two orders of magnitude lower inference latency than centralized MARL approaches due to its fully parallel and distributed execution. These results establish APS-GNN as a practical and scalable solution for APS in large-scale CFmMIMO networks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under submission to an IEEE journal</p></details> |
| **[Optimizing Graph Causal Classification Models: Estimating Causal Effects and Addressing Confounders](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17941v1)** | 2026-02-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph data is becoming increasingly prevalent due to the growing demand for relational insights in AI across various domains. Organizations regularly use graph data to solve complex problems involving relationships and connections. Causal learning is especially important in this context, since it helps to understand cause-effect relationships rather than mere associations. Since many real-world systems are inherently causal, graphs can efficiently model these systems. However, traditional graph machine learning methods including graph neural networks (GNNs), rely on correlations and are sensitive to spurious patterns and distribution changes. On the other hand, causal models enable robust predictions by isolating true causal factors, thus making them more stable under such shifts. Causal learning also helps in identifying and adjusting for confounders, ensuring that predictions reflect true causal relationships and remain accurate even under interventions. To address these challenges and build models that are robust and causally informed, we propose CCAGNN, a Confounder-Aware causal GNN framework that incorporates causal reasoning into graph learning, supporting counterfactual reasoning and providing reliable predictions in real-world settings. Comprehensive experiments on six publicly available datasets from diverse domains show that CCAGNN consistently outperforms leading state-of-the-art models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Causal Neighbourhood Learning for Invariant Graph Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17934v1)** | 2026-02-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph data often contain noisy and spurious correlations that mask the true causal relationships, which are essential for enabling graph models to make predictions based on the underlying causal structure of the data. Dependence on spurious connections makes it challenging for traditional Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to generalize effectively across different graphs. Furthermore, traditional aggregation methods tend to amplify these spurious patterns, limiting model robustness under distribution shifts. To address these issues, we propose Causal Neighbourhood Learning with Graph Neural Networks (CNL-GNN), a novel framework that performs causal interventions on graph structure. CNL-GNN effectively identifies and preserves causally relevant connections and reduces spurious influences through the generation of counterfactual neighbourhoods and adaptive edge perturbation guided by learnable importance masking and an attention-based mechanism. In addition, by combining structural-level interventions with the disentanglement of causal features from confounding factors, the model learns invariant node representations that are robust and generalize well across different graph structures. Our approach improves causal graph learning beyond traditional feature-based methods, resulting in a robust classification model. Extensive experiments on four publicly available datasets, including multiple domain variants of one dataset, demonstrate that CNL-GNN outperforms state-of-the-art GNN models.</p></details> |  |
| **[ViGText: Deepfake Image Detection with Vision-Language Model Explanations and Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18031v2)** | 2026-02-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid rise of deepfake technology, which produces realistic but fraudulent digital content, threatens the authenticity of media. Traditional deepfake detection approaches often struggle with sophisticated, customized deepfakes, especially in terms of generalization and robustness against malicious attacks. This paper introduces ViGText, a novel approach that integrates images with Vision Large Language Model (VLLM) Text explanations within a Graph-based framework to improve deepfake detection. The novelty of ViGText lies in its integration of detailed explanations with visual data, as it provides a more context-aware analysis than captions, which often lack specificity and fail to reveal subtle inconsistencies. ViGText systematically divides images into patches, constructs image and text graphs, and integrates them for analysis using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to identify deepfakes. Through the use of multi-level feature extraction across spatial and frequency domains, ViGText captures details that enhance its robustness and accuracy to detect sophisticated deepfakes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ViGText significantly enhances generalization and achieves a notable performance boost when it detects user-customized deepfakes. Specifically, average F1 scores rise from 72.45% to 98.32% under generalization evaluation, and reflects the model's superior ability to generalize to unseen, fine-tuned variations of stable diffusion models. As for robustness, ViGText achieves an increase of 11.1% in recall compared to other deepfake detection approaches. When facing targeted attacks that exploit its graph-based architecture, ViGText limits classification performance degradation to less than 4%. ViGText uses detailed visual and textual analysis to set a new standard for detecting deepfakes, helping ensure media authenticity and information integrity.</p></details> |  |
| **[COMBA: Cross Batch Aggregation for Learning Large Graphs with Context Gating State Space Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17893v1)** | 2026-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>State space models (SSMs) have recently emerged for modeling long-range dependency in sequence data, with much simplified computational costs than modern alternatives, such as transformers. Advancing SMMs to graph structured data, especially for large graphs, is a significant challenge because SSMs are sequence models and the shear graph volumes make it very expensive to convert graphs as sequences for effective learning. In this paper, we propose COMBA to tackle large graph learning using state space models, with two key innovations: graph context gating and cross batch aggregation. Graph context refers to different hops of neighborhood for each node, and graph context gating allows COMBA to use such context to learn best control of neighbor aggregation. For each graph context, COMBA samples nodes as batches, and train a graph neural network (GNN), with information being aggregated cross batches, allowing COMBA to scale to large graphs. Our theoretical study asserts that cross-batch aggregation guarantees lower error than training GNN without aggregation. Experiments on benchmark networks demonstrate significant performance gains compared to baseline approaches. Code and benchmark datasets will be released for public access.</p></details> |  |

While decentralized protocols increasingly adopt zero-knowledge proofs to obfuscate transaction graphs, centralized stablecoins remain critical "transparent choke points" for compliance. Leveraging this persistent visibility, this study analyzes an Ethereum dataset and uses behavioral features to develop a robust AML framework. Our findings demonstrate that domain-informed tree ensemble models achieve higher Macro-F1 score, significantly outperforming graph neural networks, which struggle with the increasing fragmentation of transaction networks. The model's interpretability goes beyond binary detection, successfully dissecting distinct typologies: it differentiates the complex, high-velocity dispersion of cybercrime syndicates from the constrained, static footprints left by sanctioned entities. This framework aligns with the industry shift toward deterministic verification, satisfying the auditability and compliance expectations under regulations such as the EU's MiCA and the U.S. GENIUS Act while minimizing unjustified asset freezes. By automating high-precision detection, we propose an approach that effectively raises the economic cost of financial misconduct without stifling innovation.</p></details> | 27 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Graph Neural Model Predictive Control for High-Dimensional Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17601v1)** | 2026-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The control of high-dimensional systems, such as soft robots, requires models that faithfully capture complex dynamics while remaining computationally tractable. This work presents a framework that integrates Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based dynamics models with structure-exploiting Model Predictive Control to enable real-time control of high-dimensional systems. By representing the system as a graph with localized interactions, the GNN preserves sparsity, while a tailored condensing algorithm eliminates state variables from the control problem, ensuring efficient computation. The complexity of our condensing algorithm scales linearly with the number of system nodes, and leverages Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) parallelization to achieve real-time performance. The proposed approach is validated in simulation and experimentally on a physical soft robotic trunk. Results show that our method scales to systems with up to 1,000 nodes at 100 Hz in closed-loop, and demonstrates real-time reference tracking on hardware with sub-centimeter accuracy, outperforming baselines by 63.6%. Finally, we show the capability of our method to achieve effective full-body obstacle avoidance.</p></details> |  |

While GNNs have demonstrated broad applicability, understanding their expressive power remains an important question. In this paper, we propose GNN architectures that correspond precisely to prominent fragments of first-order logic (FO), including various modal logics as well as more expressive two-variable fragments. To establish these results, we apply methods from finite model theory of first-order and modal logics to the domain of graph representation learning. Our results provide a unifying framework for understanding the logical expressiveness of GNNs within FO.</p></details> | 21 pages |
| **[From Subtle to Significant: Prompt-Driven Self-Improving Optimization in Test-Time Graph OOD Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17342v1)** | 2026-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection aims to identify whether a test graph deviates from the distribution of graphs observed during training, which is critical for ensuring the reliability of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) when deployed in open-world scenarios. Recent advances in graph OOD detection have focused on test-time training techniques that facilitate OOD detection without accessing potential supervisory information (e.g., training data). However, most of these methods employ a one-pass inference paradigm, which prevents them from progressively correcting erroneous predictions to amplify OOD signals. To this end, we propose a \textbf{S}elf-\textbf{I}mproving \textbf{G}raph \textbf{O}ut-\textbf{o}f-\textbf{D}istribution detector (SIGOOD), which is an unsupervised framework that integrates continuous self-learning with test-time training for effective graph OOD detection. Specifically, SIGOOD generates a prompt to construct a prompt-enhanced graph that amplifies potential OOD signals. To optimize prompts, SIGOOD introduces an Energy Preference Optimization (EPO) loss, which leverages energy variations between the original test graph and the prompt-enhanced graph. By iteratively optimizing the prompt by involving it into the detection model in a self-improving loop, the resulting optimal prompt-enhanced graph is ultimately used for OOD detection. Comprehensive evaluations on 21 real-world datasets confirm the effectiveness and outperformance of our SIGOOD method. The code is at https://github.com/Ee1s/SIGOOD.</p></details> | 9pages, 5 figures |

To address this gap, we study an aggregate-and-readout model that encompasses several common message passing architectures: node features are first propagated over the graph then mapped to responses via a nonlinear function. For least-squares estimation over GNNs with linear graph convolutions and a deep ReLU readout, we prove a sharp non-asymptotic risk bound that separates approximation, stochastic, and optimization errors. The bound makes explicit how performance scales with the fraction of labeled nodes and graph-induced dependence. Approximation guarantees are further derived for graph-smoothing followed by smooth nonlinear readouts, yielding convergence rates that recover classical nonparametric behavior under full supervision while characterizing performance when labels are scarce. Numerical experiments validate our theory, providing a systematic framework for understanding GNN performance and limitations.</p></details> | 57 pages, 7 figures |

However, it remains unclear when multi-hop structural reasoning is actually necessary. In this work, we introduce locality radius, a formal measure of the minimum structural neighborhood required to determine a prediction in relational schemas. We hypothesize that model performance depends critically on alignment between task locality radius and architectural aggregation depth. We conduct a controlled empirical study across foreign key prediction, join cost estimation, blast radius regression, cascade impact classification, and additional graph-derived schema tasks. Our evaluation includes multi-seed experiments, capacity-matched comparisons, statistical significance testing, scaling analysis, and synthetic radius-controlled benchmarks. Results reveal a consistent bias-radius alignment effect.</p></details> |  |

To address these systemic vulnerabilities, we present AdvSynGNN, a comprehensive architecture designed for resilient node-level representation learning. The proposed framework orchestrates multi-resolution structural synthesis alongside contrastive objectives to establish geometry-sensitive initializations. We develop a transformer backbone that adaptively accommodates heterophily by modulating attention mechanisms through learned topological signals. Central to our contribution is an integrated adversarial propagation engine, where a generative component identifies potential connectivity alterations while a discriminator enforces global coherence. Furthermore, label refinement is achieved through a residual correction scheme guided by per-node confidence metrics, which facilitates precise control over iterative stability. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that this synergistic approach effectively optimizes predictive accuracy across diverse graph distributions while maintaining computational efficiency. The study concludes with practical implementation protocols to ensure the robust deployment of the AdvSynGNN system in large-scale environments.</p></details> | 32 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Predicting The Cop Number Using Machine Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16600v1)** | 2026-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cops and Robbers is a pursuit evasion game played on a graph, first introduced independently by Quilliot \cite{quilliot1978jeux} and Nowakowski and Winkler \cite{NOWAKOWSKI1983235} over four decades ago. A main interest in recent the literature is identifying the cop number of graph families. The cop number of a graph, $c(G)$, is defined as the minimum number of cops required to guarantee capture of the robber. Determining the cop number is computationally difficult and exact algorithms for this are typically restricted to small graph families. This paper investigates whether classical machine learning methods and graph neural networks can accurately predict a graph's cop number from its structural properties and identify which properties most strongly influence this prediction. Of the classical machine learning models, tree-based models achieve high accuracy in prediction despite class imbalance, whereas graph neural networks achieve comparable results without explicit feature engineering. The interpretability analysis shows that the most predictive features are related to node connectivity, clustering, clique structure, and width parameters, which aligns with known theoretical results. Our findings suggest that machine learning approaches can be used in complement with existing cop number algorithms by offering scalable approximations where computation is infeasible.</p></details> | 8 pages |

We present an FPGA implementation of event-graph neural networks for audio processing. We utilise an artificial cochlea that converts time-series signals into sparse event data, reducing memory and computation costs. Our architecture was implemented on a SoC FPGA and evaluated on two open-source datasets. For classification task, our baseline floating-point model achieves 92.7% accuracy on SHD dataset - only 2.4% below the state of the art - while requiring over 10x and 67x fewer parameters. On SSC, our models achieve 66.9-71.0% accuracy. Compared to FPGA-based spiking neural networks, our quantised model reaches 92.3% accuracy, outperforming them by up to 19.3% while reducing resource usage and latency. For SSC, we report the first hardware-accelerated evaluation. We further demonstrate the first end-to-end FPGA implementation of event-audio keyword spotting, combining graph convolutional layers with recurrent sequence modelling. The system achieves up to 95% word-end detection accuracy, with only 10.53 microsecond latency and 1.18 W power consumption, establishing a strong benchmark for energy-efficient event-driven KWS.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under revision in TRETS Journal</p></details> |

This concept is developed within a one-dimensional framework as a foundational step. Traditional numerical methods, while effective, are computationally intensive and less scalable. By utilizing GNNs, the proposed model, termed the Collision-captured Network (CN), integrates data assimilation (DA) techniques to effectively learn and predict sea ice dynamics under various conditions. The approach was validated using synthetic data, both with and without observed data points, and it was found that the model accelerates the simulation of trajectories without compromising accuracy. This advancement offers a more efficient tool for forecasting in marginal ice zones (MIZ) and highlights the potential of combining machine learning with data assimilation for more effective and efficient modeling.</p></details> |  |
| **[Investigating GNN Convergence on Large Randomly Generated Graphs with Realistic Node Feature Correlations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16145v1)** | 2026-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>There are a number of existing studies analysing the convergence behaviour of graph neural networks on large random graphs. Unfortunately, the majority of these studies do not model correlations between node features, which would naturally exist in a variety of real-life networks. Consequently, the derived limitations of GNNs, resulting from such convergence behaviour, is not truly reflective of the expressive power of GNNs when applied to realistic graphs. In this paper, we will introduce a novel method to generate random graphs that have correlated node features. The node features will be sampled in such a manner to ensure correlation between neighbouring nodes. As motivation for our choice of sampling scheme, we will appeal to properties exhibited by real-life graphs, particularly properties that are captured by the Barabási-Albert model. A theoretical analysis will strongly indicate that convergence can be avoided in some cases, which we will empirically validate on large random graphs generated using our novel method. The observed divergent behaviour provides evidence that GNNs may be more expressive than initial studies would suggest, especially on realistic graphs.</p></details> | 8 pages, 1 figure |

Existing approaches face fundamental limitations: they cannot effectively share intelligence across borders due to privacy constraints, lack reasoning capabilities to understand complex multi-step attack patterns, and fail to capture intricate graph-structured relationships in financial networks. We introduce FedGraph-AGI, a novel federated learning framework integrating Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) reasoning with graph neural networks for privacy-preserving cross-border insider threat detection. Our approach combines: (1) federated graph neural networks preserving data sovereignty; (2) Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) aggregation for heterogeneous jurisdictions; and (3) AGI-powered reasoning via Large Action Models (LAM) performing causal inference over graph data. Through experiments on a 50,000-transaction dataset across 10 jurisdictions, FedGraph-AGI achieves 92.3% accuracy, significantly outperforming federated baselines (86.1%) and centralized approaches (84.7%). Our ablation studies reveal AGI reasoning contributes 6.8% improvement, while MoE adds 4.4%. The system maintains epsilon = 1.0 differential privacy while achieving near-optimal performance and scales efficiently to 50+ clients. This represents the first integration of AGI reasoning with federated graph learning for insider threat detection, opening new directions for privacy-preserving cross-border intelligence sharing.</p></details> | 35 Pages, 8 figures |

While generative modeling has revolutionized structure discovery for molecules, inorganic solids, and metal-organic frameworks, extending such approaches to fully periodic molecular crystals is still elusive. Here, we present MolCrystalFlow, a flow-based generative model for molecular crystal structure prediction. The framework disentangles intramolecular complexity from intermolecular packing by embedding molecules as rigid bodies and jointly learning the lattice matrix, molecular orientations, and centroid positions. Centroids and orientations are represented on their native Riemannian manifolds, allowing geodesic flow construction and graph neural network operations that respects geometric symmetries. We benchmark our model against state-of-the-art generative models for large-size periodic crystals and rule-based structure generation methods on two open-source molecular crystal datasets. We demonstrate an integration of MolCrystalFlow model with universal machine learning potential to accelerate molecular crystal structure prediction, paving the way for data-driven generative discovery of molecular crystals.</p></details> | 20 pages, 4 figures |

In this work, we introduce a fully quantum graph convolutional architecture designed explicitly for unsupervised learning in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) regime. Our approach combines a variational quantum feature extraction layer with an edge-local and qubit-efficient quantum message-passing mechanism inspired by the Quantum Alternating Operator Ansatz (QAOA) framework. Unlike prior models that rely on global operations or multi-controlled unitaries, our model decomposes message passing into pairwise interactions along graph edges using only hardware-native single- and two-qubit gates. This design reduces the qubit requirement from $O(Nn)$ to $O(n)$ for a graph with $N$ nodes and $n$-qubit feature registers, enabling implementation on current quantum devices regardless of graph size. We train the model using the Deep Graph Infomax objective to perform unsupervised node representation learning. Experiments on the Cora citation network and a large-scale genomic SNP dataset demonstrate that our model remains competitive with prior quantum and hybrid approaches.</p></details> |  |

Traditional bot mitigation techniques, including IP blacklists and CAPTCHA-based challenges, are increasingly ineffective or intrusive, as modern bots leverage proxies, botnets, and AI-assisted evasion strategies. This work proposes a non-intrusive graph-based bot detection framework for e-commerce that models user session behavior through a graph representation and applies an inductive graph neural network for classification. The approach captures both relational structure and behavioral semantics, enabling accurate identification of subtle automated activity that evades feature-based methods. Experiments on real-world e-commerce traffic demonstrate that the proposed inductive graph model outperforms a strong session-level multilayer perceptron baseline in terms of AUC and F1 score. Additional adversarial perturbation and cold-start simulations show that the model remains robust under moderate graph modifications and generalizes effectively to previously unseen sessions and URLs. The proposed framework is deployment-friendly, integrates with existing systems without client-side instrumentation, and supports real-time inference and incremental updates, making it suitable for practical e-commerce security deployments.</p></details> |  |
| **[GenDA: Generative Data Assimilation on Complex Urban Areas via Classifier-Free Diffusion Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11440v2)** | 2026-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Urban wind flow reconstruction is essential for assessing air quality, heat dispersion, and pedestrian comfort, yet remains challenging when only sparse sensor data are available. We propose GenDA, a generative data assimilation framework that reconstructs high-resolution wind fields on unstructured meshes from limited observations. The model employs a multiscale graph-based diffusion architecture trained on computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations and interprets classifier-free guidance as a learned posterior reconstruction mechanism: the unconditional branch learns a geometry-aware flow prior, while the sensor-conditioned branch injects observational constraints during sampling. This formulation enables obstacle-aware reconstruction and generalization across unseen geometries, wind directions, and mesh resolutions without retraining. We consider both sparse fixed sensors and trajectory-based observations using the same reconstruction procedure. When evaluated against supervised graph neural network (GNN) baselines and classical reduced-order data assimilation methods, GenDA reduces the relative root-mean-square error (RRMSE) by 25-57% and increases the structural similarity index (SSIM) by 23-33% across the tested meshes. Experiments are conducted on Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) simulations of a real urban neighbourhood in Bristol, United Kingdom, at a characteristic Reynolds number of $\mathrm{Re}\approx2\times10^{7}$, featuring complex building geometry and irregular terrain. The proposed framework provides a scalable path toward generative, geometry-aware data assimilation for environmental monitoring in complex domains.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Code Smell Refactoring Approach using GNNs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12069v2)** | 2026-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code smell is a great challenge in software refactoring, which indicates latent design or implementation flaws that may degrade the software maintainability and evolution. Over the past decades, a variety of refactoring approaches have been proposed, which can be broadly classified into metrics-based, rule-based, and machine learning-based approaches. Recent years, deep learning-based approaches have also attracted widespread attention. However, existing techniques exhibit various limitations. Metrics- and rule-based approaches rely heavily on manually defined heuristics and thresholds, whereas deep learning-based approaches are often constrained by dataset availability and model design. In this study, we proposed a graph-based deep learning approach for code smell refactoring. Specifically, we designed two types of input graphs (class-level and method-level) and employed both graph classification and node classification tasks to address the refactoring of three representative code smells: long method, large class, and feature envy. In our experiment, we propose a semi-automated dataset generation approach that could generate a large-scale dataset with minimal manual effort. We implemented the proposed approach with three classical GNN (graph neural network) architectures: GCN, GraphSAGE, and GAT, and evaluated its performance against both traditional and state-of-the-art deep learning approaches. The results demonstrate that proposed approach achieves superior refactoring performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond ReLU: Bifurcation, Oversmoothing, and Topological Priors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15634v1)** | 2026-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) learn node representations through iterative network-based message-passing. While powerful, deep GNNs suffer from oversmoothing, where node features converge to a homogeneous, non-informative state. We re-frame this problem of representational collapse from a \emph{bifurcation theory} perspective, characterizing oversmoothing as convergence to a stable ``homogeneous fixed point.'' Our central contribution is the theoretical discovery that this undesired stability can be broken by replacing standard monotone activations (e.g., ReLU) with a class of functions. Using Lyapunov-Schmidt reduction, we analytically prove that this substitution induces a bifurcation that destabilizes the homogeneous state and creates a new pair of stable, non-homogeneous \emph{patterns} that provably resist oversmoothing. Our theory predicts a precise, nontrivial scaling law for the amplitude of these emergent patterns, which we quantitatively validate in experiments. Finally, we demonstrate the practical utility of our theory by deriving a closed-form, bifurcation-aware initialization and showing its utility in real benchmark experiments.</p></details> |  |

In federated GNN settings, client graphs often exhibit heterogeneous structural and propagation characteristics. When standard aggregation mechanisms are applied to such heterogeneous updates, the global model may converge numerically while exhibiting degraded relational behavior.Our work identifies a geometric failure mode of global aggregation in Cross- Domain Federated GNNs. Although GNN parameters are numerically represented as vectors, they encode relational transformations that govern the direction, strength, and sensitivity of information flow across graph neighborhoods. Aggregating updates originating from incompatible propagation regimes can therefore introduce destructive interference in this transformation space.This leads to loss of coherence in global message passing. Importantly, this degradation is not necessarily reflected in conventional metrics such as loss or accuracy.To address this issue, we propose GGRS (Global Geometric Reference Structure), a server-side framework that regulates client updates prior to aggregation based on geometric admissibility criteria. GGRS preserves directional consistency of relational transformations as well as maintains diversity of admissible propagation subspaces. It also stabilizes sensitivity to neighborhood interactions, without accessing client data or graph topology. Experiments on heterogeneous GNN-native, Amazon Co-purchase datasets demonstrate that GGRS preserves global message-passing coherence across training rounds by highlighting the necessity of geometry-aware regulation in federated graph learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is a developing preprint of an 18-page journal manuscript (6 figures), currently being prepared for formal peer-review submission</p></details> |
| **[NeuroLifting: Neural Inference on Markov Random Fields at Scale](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18954v3)** | 2026-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inference in large-scale Markov Random Fields (MRFs) is a critical yet challenging task, traditionally approached through approximate methods like belief propagation and mean field, or exact methods such as the Toulbar2 solver. These strategies often fail to strike an optimal balance between efficiency and solution quality, particularly as the problem scale increases. This paper introduces NeuroLifting, a novel technique that leverages Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to reparameterize decision variables in MRFs, facilitating the use of standard gradient descent optimization. By extending traditional lifting techniques into a non-parametric neural network framework, NeuroLifting benefits from the smooth loss landscape of neural networks, enabling efficient and parallelizable optimization. Empirical results demonstrate that, on moderate scales, NeuroLifting performs very close to the exact solver Toulbar2 in terms of solution quality, significantly surpassing existing approximate methods. Notably, on large-scale MRFs, NeuroLifting delivers superior solution quality against all baselines, as well as exhibiting linear computational complexity growth. This work presents a significant advancement in MRF inference, offering a scalable and effective solution for large-scale problems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Size Transferability of Graph Transformers with Convolutional Positional Encodings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15239v1)** | 2026-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformers have achieved remarkable success across domains, motivating the rise of Graph Transformers (GTs) as attention-based architectures for graph-structured data. A key design choice in GTs is the use of Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based positional encodings to incorporate structural information. In this work, we study GTs through the lens of manifold limit models for graph sequences and establish a theoretical connection between GTs with GNN positional encodings and Manifold Neural Networks (MNNs). Building on transferability results for GNNs under manifold convergence, we show that GTs inherit transferability guarantees from their positional encodings. In particular, GTs trained on small graphs provably generalize to larger graphs under mild assumptions. We complement our theory with extensive experiments on standard graph benchmarks, demonstrating that GTs exhibit scalable behavior on par with GNNs. To further show the efficiency in a real-world scenario, we implement GTs for shortest path distance estimation over terrains to better illustrate the efficiency of the transferable GTs. Our results provide new insights into the understanding of GTs and suggest practical directions for efficient training of GTs in large-scale settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Grappa: Gradient-Only Communication for Scalable Graph Neural Network Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01872v2)** | 2026-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cross-partition edges dominate the cost of distributed GNN training: fetching remote features and activations per iteration overwhelms the network as graphs deepen and partition counts grow. Grappa is a distributed GNN training framework that enforces gradient-only communication: during each iteration, partitions train in isolation and exchange only gradients for the global update. To recover accuracy lost to isolation, Grappa (i) periodically repartitions to expose new neighborhoods and (ii) applies a lightweight coverage-corrected gradient aggregation inspired by importance sampling. We present an asymptotically unbiased estimator for gradient correction, which we use to develop a minimum-distance batch-level variant that is compatible with common deep-learning packages. We also introduce a shrinkage version that improves stability in practice. Empirical results on real and synthetic graphs show that Grappa trains GNNs 4x faster on average (up to 13x) than state-of-the-art systems, achieves better accuracy especially for deeper models, and sustains training at the trillion-edge scale on commodity hardware. Grappa is model-agnostic, supports full-graph and mini-batch training, and does not rely on high-bandwidth interconnects or caching.</p></details> |  |
| **[iQUEST: An Iterative Question-Guided Framework for Knowledge Base Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01784v6)** | 2026-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in many natural language processing tasks but often exhibit factual inconsistencies in knowledge-intensive settings. Integrating external knowledge resources, particularly knowledge graphs (KGs), provides a transparent and updatable foundation for more reliable reasoning. Knowledge Base Question Answering (KBQA), which queries and reasons over KGs, is central to this effort, especially for complex, multi-hop queries. However, multi-hop reasoning poses two key challenges: (1)~maintaining coherent reasoning paths, and (2)~avoiding prematurely discarding critical multi-hop connections. To tackle these challenges, we introduce iQUEST, a question-guided KBQA framework that iteratively decomposes complex queries into simpler sub-questions, ensuring a structured and focused reasoning trajectory. Additionally, we integrate a Graph Neural Network (GNN) to look ahead and incorporate 2-hop neighbor information at each reasoning step. This dual approach strengthens the reasoning process, enabling the model to explore viable paths more effectively. Detailed experiments demonstrate the consistent improvement delivered by iQUEST across four benchmark datasets and four LLMs. The code is publicly available at: https://github.com/Wangshuaiia/iQUEST.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the 63rd Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL 2025), Main Track</p></details> |
| **[Learning Structural Hardness for Combinatorial Auctions: Instance-Dependent Algorithm Selection via Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14772v1)** | 2026-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Winner Determination Problem (WDP) in combinatorial auctions is NP-hard, and no existing method reliably predicts which instances will defeat fast greedy heuristics. The ML-for-combinatorial-optimization community has focused on learning to \emph{replace} solvers, yet recent evidence shows that graph neural networks (GNNs) rarely outperform well-tuned classical methods on standard benchmarks. We pursue a different objective: learning to predict \emph{when} a given instance is hard for greedy allocation, enabling instance-dependent algorithm selection. We design a 20-dimensional structural feature vector and train a lightweight MLP hardness classifier that predicts the greedy optimality gap with mean absolute error 0.033, Pearson correlation 0.937, and binary classification accuracy 94.7\% across three random seeds. For instances identified as hard -- those exhibiting ``whale-fish'' trap structure where greedy provably fails -- we deploy a heterogeneous GNN specialist that achieves ${\approx}0\%$ optimality gap on all six adversarial configurations tested (vs.\ 3.75--59.24\% for greedy). A hybrid allocator combining the hardness classifier with GNN and greedy solvers achieves 0.51\% overall gap on mixed distributions. Our honest evaluation on CATS benchmarks confirms that GNNs do not outperform Gurobi (0.45--0.71 vs.\ 0.20 gap), motivating the algorithm selection framing. Learning \emph{when} to deploy expensive solvers is more tractable than learning to replace them.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bayesian Cosmic Void Finding with Graph Flows](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14630v1)** | 2026-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cosmic voids contain higher-order cosmological information and are of interest for astroparticle physics. Finding genuine matter underdensities in sparse galaxy surveys is, however, an underconstrained problem. Traditional void finding algorithms produce deterministic void catalogs, neglecting the probabilistic nature of the problem. We present a method to sample from the stochastic mapping from galaxy catalogs to arbitrary void definitions. Our algorithm uses a deep graph neural network to evolve "test particles" according to a flow-matching objective. We demonstrate the method in a simplified example setting but outline steps to generalize it towards practically usable void finders. Trained on a deterministic teacher, the model performs well but has considerable stochasticity which we interpret as regularization. Cosmological information in the predicted void catalogs outperforms the teacher. On the one hand, our method can cheaply emulate existing void finders with apparently useful regularization. More importantly, it also allows us to find the Bayes-optimal mapping between observed galaxies and any void definition. This includes definitions operating at the level of simulated matter density and velocity fields.</p></details> | <details><summary>8+3 p...</summary><p>8+3 pages, 9+2 figures.

| **[Heuristic Methods are Good Teachers to Distill MLPs for Graph Link Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06193v3)** | 2026-02-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Link prediction is a crucial graph-learning task with applications including citation prediction and product recommendation. Distilling Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) teachers into Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) students has emerged as an effective approach to achieve strong performance and reducing computational cost by removing graph dependency. However, existing distillation methods only use standard GNNs and overlook alternative teachers such as specialized model for link prediction (GNN4LP) and heuristic methods (e.g., common neighbors). This paper first explores the impact of different teachers in GNN-to-MLP distillation. Surprisingly, we find that stronger teachers do not always produce stronger students: MLPs distilled from GNN4LP can underperform those distilled from simpler GNNs, while weaker heuristic methods can teach MLPs to near-GNN performance with drastically reduced training costs. Building on these insights, we propose Ensemble Heuristic-Distilled MLPs (EHDM), which eliminates graph dependencies while effectively integrating complementary signals via a gating mechanism. Experiments on ten datasets show an average 7.93% improvement over previous GNN-to-MLP approaches with 1.95-3.32 times less training time, indicating EHDM is an efficient and effective link prediction method.

| **[Whom to Query for What: Adaptive Group Elicitation via Multi-Turn LLM Interactions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14279v1)** | 2026-02-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Eliciting information to reduce uncertainty about latent group-level properties from surveys and other collective assessments requires allocating limited questioning effort under real costs and missing data. Although large language models enable adaptive, multi-turn interactions in natural language, most existing elicitation methods optimize what to ask with a fixed respondent pool, and do not adapt respondent selection or leverage population structure when responses are partial or incomplete. To address this gap, we study adaptive group elicitation, a multi-round setting where an agent adaptively selects both questions and respondents under explicit query and participation budgets. We propose a theoretically grounded framework that combines (i) an LLM-based expected information gain objective for scoring candidate questions with (ii) heterogeneous graph neural network propagation that aggregates observed responses and participant attributes to impute missing responses and guide per-round respondent selection. This closed-loop procedure queries a small, informative subset of individuals while inferring population-level responses via structured similarity. Across three real-world opinion datasets, our method consistently improves population-level response prediction under constrained budgets, including a >12% relative gain on CES at a 10% respondent budget.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Hybrid TGN-SEAL Model for Dynamic Graph Link Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14239v1)** | 2026-02-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predicting links in sparse, continuously evolving networks is a central challenge in network science. Conventional heuristic methods and deep learning models, including Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), are typically designed for static graphs and thus struggle to capture temporal dependencies. Snapshot-based techniques partially address this issue but often encounter data sparsity and class imbalance, particularly in networks with transient interactions such as telecommunication call detail records (CDRs). Temporal Graph Networks (TGNs) model dynamic graphs by updating node embeddings over time; however, their predictive accuracy under sparse conditions remains limited. In this study, we improve the TGN framework by extracting enclosing subgraphs around candidate links, enabling the model to jointly learn structural and temporal information. Experiments on a sparse CDR dataset show that our approach increases average precision by 2.6% over standard TGNs, demonstrating the advantages of integrating local topology for robust link prediction in dynamic networks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generation of Uncertainty-Aware High-Level Spatial Concepts in Factorized 3D Scene Graphs via Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11972v3)** | 2026-02-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Enabling robots to autonomously discover high-level spatial concepts (e.g., rooms and walls) from primitive geometric observations (e.g., planar surfaces) within 3D Scene Graphs is essential for robust indoor navigation and mapping. These graphs provide a hierarchical metric-semantic representation in which such concepts are organized. To further enhance graph-SLAM performance, Factorized 3D Scene Graphs incorporate these concepts as optimization factors that constrain relative geometry and enforce global consistency. However, both stages of this process remain largely manual: concepts are typically derived using hand-crafted, concept-specific heuristics, while factors and their covariances are likewise manually designed. This reliance on manual specification limits generalization across diverse environments and scalability to new concept classes. This paper presents a novel learning-based method that infers spatial concepts online from observed vertical planes and introduces them as optimizable factors within a SLAM backend, eliminating the need to handcraft concept generation, factor design, and covariance specification. We evaluate our approach in simulated environments with complex layouts, improving room detection by 20.7% and trajectory estimation by 19.2%, and further validate it on real construction sites, where room detection improves by 5.3% and map matching accuracy by 3.8%. Results confirm that learned factors can improve their handcrafted counterparts in SLAM systems and serve as a foundation for extending this approach to new spatial concepts.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (RA-L)</p></details> |

Standard Large Language Modles (LLMs) are often unsuitable for this task due to context window limitations that prevent them from processing entire code repositories. As a result, various retrieval methods are commonly used, including keyword matching, text similarity, and simple graph-based heuristics such as Breadth-First Search. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) offer a promising alternative due to their ability to model complex, repository-wide dependencies; however, their application has been hindered by the lack of a dedicated benchmark. To address this gap, we introduce GREPO, the first GNN benchmark for repository-scale bug localization tasks. GREPO comprises 86 Python repositories and 47294 bug-fixing tasks, providing graph-based data structures ready for direct GNN processing. Our evaluation of various GNN architectures shows outstanding performance compared to established information retrieval baselines. This work highlights the potential of GNNs for bug localization and established GREPO as a foundation resource for future research, The code is available at https://github.com/qingpingmo/GREPO.</p></details> | 46 pages, 14figures |
| **[GraphFM: A generalist graph transformer that learns transferable representations across diverse domains](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11907v2)** | 2026-02-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) are often trained on individual datasets, requiring specialized models and significant hyperparameter tuning due to the unique structures and features of each dataset. This approach limits the scalability and generalizability of GNNs, as models must be tailored for each specific graph type. To address these challenges, we introduce GraphFM, a scalable multi-graph pretraining approach designed for learning across diverse graph datasets. GraphFM uses a Perceiver-based encoder with learned latent tokens to compress domain-specific features into a shared latent space, enabling generalization across graph domains. We propose new techniques for scaling up graph training on datasets of different sizes, allowing us to train GraphFM on 152 distinct graph datasets, containing a total of 7.4 million nodes and 189 million edges. This allows us to study the effect of scale on pretraining across domains such as molecules, citation networks, and product graphs, and show that training on diverse datasets improves performance over single-source pretraining. Additionally, pretraining with a mixture of synthetic and real graphs enhances adaptability and stability, leading to competitive performance with state-of-the-art models across various node classification tasks. This approach reduces the burden of dataset-specific training and provides a single generalist model capable of performing across multiple diverse graph structures and tasks.

However, NAS-based methods are identified to be prone to over-smoothing-the loss of node distinguishability with increased iterations-thereby limiting their effectiveness. This paper identifies two characteristics in a network, i.e., the distributions of nodes and node degrees that are critical for expressive representation but have been overlooked in existing methods. We show that these overlooked characteristics contribute significantly to over-smoothing of NAS-methods. To address this, we propose a novel weighted distribution-aware kernel that embeds nodes while taking their distributional characteristics into consideration. Our method has three distinguishing features: (1) it is the first method to explicitly incorporate both distributional characteristics; (2) it requires no optimization; and (3) it effectively mitigates the adverse effects of over-smoothing, allowing WL to preserve node distinguishability and expressiveness even after many iterations of embedding. Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior community detection performance via spectral clustering, outperforming existing graph embedding methods, including deep learning methods, on standard benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning to Approximate Uniform Facility Location via Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13155v1)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>There has been a growing interest in using neural networks, especially message-passing neural networks (MPNNs), to solve hard combinatorial optimization problems heuristically. However, existing learning-based approaches for hard combinatorial optimization tasks often rely on supervised training data, reinforcement learning, or gradient estimators, leading to significant computational overhead, unstable training, or a lack of provable performance guarantees. In contrast, classical approximation algorithms offer such performance guarantees under worst-case inputs but are non-differentiable and unable to adaptively exploit structural regularities in natural input distributions. We address this dichotomy with the fundamental example of Uniform Facility Location (UniFL), a variant of the combinatorial facility location problem with applications in clustering, data summarization, logistics, and supply chain design. We develop a fully differentiable MPNN model that embeds approximation-algorithmic principles while avoiding the need for solver supervision or discrete relaxations. Our approach admits provable approximation and size generalization guarantees to much larger instances than seen during training. Empirically, we show that our approach outperforms standard non-learned approximation algorithms in terms of solution quality, closing the gap with computationally intensive integer linear programming approaches. Overall, this work provides a step toward bridging learning-based methods and approximation algorithms for discrete optimization.</p></details> |  |

We show that a missing principle is making GNN-MD IO-aware, carefully accounting for reads and writes between GPU high-bandwidth memory (HBM) and on-chip SRAM. We present FlashSchNet, an efficient and accurate IO-aware SchNet-style GNN-MD framework built on four techniques: (1) flash radial basis, which fuses pairwise distance computation, Gaussian basis expansion, and cosine envelope into a single tiled pass, computing each distance once and reusing it across all basis functions; (2) flash message passing, which fuses cutoff, neighbor gather, filter multiplication, and reduction to avoid materializing edge tensors in HBM; (3) flash aggregation, which reformulates scatter-add via CSR segment reduce, reducing atomic writes by a factor of feature dimension and enabling contention-free accumulation in both forward and backward passes; (4) channel-wise 16-bit quantization that exploits the low per-channel dynamic range in SchNet MLP weights to further improve throughput with negligible accuracy loss. On a single NVIDIA RTX PRO 6000, FlashSchNet achieves 1000 ns/day aggregate simulation throughput over 64 parallel replicas on coarse-grained (CG) protein containing 269 beads (6.5x faster than CGSchNet baseline with 80% reduction of peak memory), surpassing classical force fields (e.g. MARTINI) while retaining SchNet-level accuracy and transferability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code is at https://github.com/UNITES-Lab/flash-molecular-dynamics</p></details> |
| **[Which Algorithms Can Graph Neural Networks Learn?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13106v1)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, there has been growing interest in understanding neural architectures' ability to learn to execute discrete algorithms, a line of work often referred to as neural algorithmic reasoning. The goal is to integrate algorithmic reasoning capabilities into larger neural pipelines. Many such architectures are based on (message-passing) graph neural networks (MPNNs), owing to their permutation equivariance and ability to deal with sparsity and variable-sized inputs. However, existing work is either largely empirical and lacks formal guarantees or it focuses solely on expressivity, leaving open the question of when and how such architectures generalize beyond a finite training set. In this work, we propose a general theoretical framework that characterizes the sufficient conditions under which MPNNs can learn an algorithm from a training set of small instances and provably approximate its behavior on inputs of arbitrary size. Our framework applies to a broad class of algorithms, including single-source shortest paths, minimum spanning trees, and general dynamic programming problems, such as the $0$-$1$ knapsack problem. In addition, we establish impossibility results for a wide range of algorithmic tasks, showing that standard MPNNs cannot learn them, and we derive more expressive MPNN-like architectures that overcome these limitations. Finally, we refine our analysis for the Bellman-Ford algorithm, yielding a substantially smaller required training set and significantly extending the recent work of Nerem et al. [2025] by allowing for a differentiable regularization loss. Empirical results largely support our theoretical findings.</p></details> |  |

Recent advances in Vicinal Risk Minimization (VRM) have shown promise in mitigating class imbalance with numeric interpolation; however, existing approaches largely rely on embedding-space arithmetic, which fails to capture the rich semantics inherent in text-attributed graphs. In this work, we propose our method, SaVe-TAG (Semantic-aware Vicinal Risk Minimization for Long-Tailed Text-Attributed Graphs), a novel VRM framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform text-level interpolation, generating on-manifold, boundary-enriching synthetic samples for minority classes. To mitigate the risk of noisy generation, we introduce a confidence-based edge assignment mechanism that uses graph topology as a natural filter to ensure structural consistency. We provide theoretical justification for our method and conduct extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, showing that our approach consistently outperforms both numeric interpolation and prior long-tailed node classification baselines. Our results highlight the importance of integrating semantic and structural signals for balanced and effective learning on text-attributed graphs.

However, existing TGNNs primarily target one-time predictions for a given temporal span, whereas many practical applications require continuous predictions, that predictions are issued frequently over time. Directly adapting existing TGNNs to continuous-prediction scenarios introduces either significant computational overhead or prediction quality issues especially for large graphs. This paper revisits the challenge of { continuous predictions} in TGNNs, and introduces {\sc Coden}, a TGNN model designed for efficient and effective learning on dynamic graphs. {\sc Coden} innovatively overcomes the key complexity bottleneck in existing TGNNs while preserving comparable predictive accuracy. Moreover, we further provide theoretical analyses that substantiate the effectiveness and efficiency of {\sc Coden}, and clarify its duality relationship with both RNN-based and attention-based models. Our evaluations across five dynamic datasets show that {\sc Coden} surpasses existing performance benchmarks in both efficiency and effectiveness, establishing it as a superior solution for continuous prediction in evolving graph environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Data-Driven Deep MIMO Detection:Network Architectures and Generalization Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20178v1)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In practical Multiuser Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MU-MIMO) systems, symbol detection remains challenging due to severe inter-user interference and sensitivity to Channel State Information (CSI) uncertainty. In contrast to the mostly studied belief propagation-type model-driven methods, which incur high computational complexity, Soft Interference Cancellation (SIC) strikes a good balance between performance and complexity. To further address CSI mismatch and nonlinear effects, the recently proposed data-driven deep neural receivers, such as DeepSIC, leverage the advantages of deep neural networks for interference cancellation and symbol detection, demonstrating strong empirical performance. However, there is still a lack of theoretical underpinning for why and to what extent DeepSIC could generalize with the number of training samples. This paper proposes inspecting the fully data-driven DeepSIC detection within a Network-of-MLPs architecture, which is composed of multiple interconnected MLPs via outer and inner Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs). Within such an architecture, DeepSIC can be upgraded as a graph-based message-passing process using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), termed GNNSIC, with shared model parameters across users and iterations. Notably, GNNSIC achieves excellent expressivity comparable to DeepSIC with substantially fewer trainable parameters, resulting in improved sample efficiency and enhanced user generalization. By conducting a norm-based generalization analysis using Rademacher complexity, we reveal that an exponential dependence on the number of iterations for DeepSIC can be eliminated in GNNSIC due to parameter sharing. Simulation results demonstrate that GNNSIC attains comparable or improved Symbol Error Rate (SER) performance to DeepSIC with significantly fewer parameters and training samples.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 7 figures.

Despite existing applications of deep learning in land use monitoring, standard convolutional kernels in deep neural networks limit the applications of these networks to the Euclidean domain only. Considering the geodesic nature of the measurement of the earth's surface, remote sensing is one such area that can benefit from non-Euclidean and spherical domains. For this purpose, we designed a novel Graph Neural Network architecture for spatial and spatio-temporal classification using satellite imagery to acquire insights into socio-economic indicators. We propose a hybrid attention method to learn the relative importance of irregular neighbors in remote sensing data. Instead of classifying each pixel, we propose a method based on Simple Linear Iterative Clustering (SLIC) image segmentation and Graph Attention Network. The superpixels obtained from SLIC become the nodes of our Graph Convolution Network (GCN). A region adjacency graph (RAG) is then constructed where each superpixel is connected to every other adjacent superpixel in the image, enabling information to propagate globally. Finally, we propose a Spatially driven Attention Graph Neural Network (SAG-NN) to classify each RAG. We also propose an extension to our SAG-NN for spatio-temporal data. Unlike regular grids of pixels in images, superpixels are irregular in nature and cannot be used to create spatio-temporal graphs. We introduce temporal bias by combining unconnected RAGs from each image into one supergraph. This is achieved by introducing block adjacency matrices resulting in novel Spatio-Temporal driven Attention Graph Neural Network with Block Adjacency matrix (STAG-NN-BA). SAG-NN and STAG-NN-BA outperform graph and non-graph baselines on Asia14 and C2D2 datasets efficiently.</p></details> |  |

Despite its importance, finding the most frequent induced subgraph remains computationally expensive due to the NP-hard nature of the subgraph counting task. Traditional exact enumeration algorithms often suffer from high time complexity, especially for a large graph size $k$. To mitigate this, existing approaches often utilize frequency measurement with the Downward Closure Property to reduce the search space, imposing additional constraints on the task. In this paper, we first formulate this task as a Markov Decision Process and approach it using a multi-task reinforcement learning framework. Specifically, we introduce RLMiner, a novel framework that integrates reinforcement learning with our proposed task-state-aware Graph Neural Network to find the most frequent induced subgraph of size $k$ with a time complexity linear to $k$. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed RLMiner effectively identifies subgraphs with frequencies closely matching the ground-truth most frequent induced subgraphs, while achieving significantly shorter and more stable running times compared to traditional methods.</p></details> |  |

We show that these wavelets may be effectively incorporated into a family of geometric graph neural networks, which we refer to as VDW-GNNs. We demonstrate that such networks are effective on synthetic point cloud data, as well as on real-world data derived from wind-field measurements and neural activity data. Theoretically, we prove that these new wavelets have desirable frame theoretic properties, similar to traditional diffusion wavelets. Additionally, we prove that these wavelets have desirable symmetries with respect to rotations and translations.</p></details> | <details><summary>A pre...</summary><p>A previous, shorter version of this work was presented in the workshop "New Perspectives in Advancing Graph Machine Learning" at NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
