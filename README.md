| **[Multitask LSTM for Arboviral Outbreak Prediction Using Public Health Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04566v1)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a multitask learning approach based on long-short-term memory (LSTM) networks for the joint prediction of arboviral outbreaks and case counts of dengue, chikungunya, and Zika in Recife, Brazil. Leveraging historical public health data from DataSUS (2017-2023), the proposed model concurrently performs binary classification (outbreak detection) and regression (case forecasting) tasks. A sliding window strategy was adopted to construct temporal features using varying input lengths (60, 90, and 120 days), with hyperparameter optimization carried out using Keras Tuner. Model evaluation used time series cross-validation for robustness and a held-out test from 2023 for generalization assessment. The results show that longer windows improve dengue regression accuracy, while classification performance peaked at intermediate windows, suggesting an optimal trade-off between sequence length and generalization. The multitask architecture delivers competitive performance across diseases and tasks, demonstrating the feasibility and advantages of unified modeling strategies for scalable epidemic forecasting in data-limited public health scenarios.</p></details> | 6 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Contaminated Multivariate Time-Series Anomaly Detection with Spatio-Temporal Graph Conditional Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12563v4)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mainstream unsupervised anomaly detection algorithms often excel in academic datasets, yet their real-world performance is restricted due to the controlled experimental conditions involving clean training data. Addressing the challenge of training with noise, a prevalent issue in practical anomaly detection, is frequently overlooked. In a pioneering endeavor, this study delves into the realm of label-level noise within sensory time-series anomaly detection (TSAD). This paper presents a novel and practical end-to-end unsupervised TSAD when the training data is contaminated with anomalies. The introduced approach, called TSAD-C, is devoid of access to abnormality labels during the training phase. TSAD-C encompasses three core modules: a Decontaminator to rectify anomalies (aka noise) present during training, a Long-range Variable Dependency Modeling module to capture long-term intra- and inter-variable dependencies within the decontaminated data that is considered as a surrogate of the pure normal data, and an Anomaly Scoring module to detect anomalies from all types. Our extensive experiments conducted on four reliable and diverse datasets conclusively demonstrate that TSAD-C surpasses existing methodologies, thus establishing a new state-of-the-art in the TSAD field.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to The Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Ranked differences Pearson correlation dissimilarity with an application to electricity users time series clustering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02173v2)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series clustering is an unsupervised learning method for classifying time series data into groups with similar behavior. It is used in applications such as healthcare, finance, economics, energy, and climate science. Several time series clustering methods have been introduced and used for over four decades. Most of them focus on measuring either Euclidean distances or association dissimilarities between time series. In this work, we propose a new dissimilarity measure called ranked Pearson correlation dissimilarity (RDPC), which combines a weighted average of a specified fraction of the largest element-wise differences with the well-known Pearson correlation dissimilarity. It is incorporated into hierarchical clustering. The performance is evaluated and compared with existing clustering algorithms. The results show that the RDPC algorithm outperforms others in complicated cases involving different seasonal patterns, trends, and peaks. Finally, we demonstrate our method by clustering a random sample of customers from a Thai electricity consumption time series dataset into seven groups with unique characteristics.</p></details> | 17 pages |
| **[Recognizing Ornaments in Vocal Indian Art Music with Active Annotation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04419v1)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ornamentations, embellishments, or microtonal inflections are essential to melodic expression across many musical traditions, adding depth, nuance, and emotional impact to performances. Recognizing ornamentations in singing voices is key to MIR, with potential applications in music pedagogy, singer identification, genre classification, and controlled singing voice generation. However, the lack of annotated datasets and specialized modeling approaches remains a major obstacle for progress in this research area. In this work, we introduce R\=aga Ornamentation Detection (ROD), a novel dataset comprising Indian classical music recordings curated by expert musicians. The dataset is annotated using a custom Human-in-the-Loop tool for six vocal ornaments marked as event-based labels. Using this dataset, we develop an ornamentation detection model based on deep time-series analysis, preserving ornament boundaries during the chunking of long audio recordings. We conduct experiments using different train-test configurations within the ROD dataset and also evaluate our approach on a separate, manually annotated dataset of Indian classical concert recordings. Our experimental results support the superior performance of our proposed approach over the baseline CRNN.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Systematic Literature Review of Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Network Models for Time Series Forecasting and Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22377v2)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, spatio-temporal graph neural networks (GNNs) have attracted considerable interest in the field of time series analysis, due to their ability to capture dependencies among variables and across time points. The objective of the presented systematic literature review is hence to provide a comprehensive overview of the various modeling approaches and application domains of GNNs for time series classification and forecasting. A database search was conducted, and over 150 journal papers were selected for a detailed examination of the current state-of-the-art in the field. This examination is intended to offer to the reader a comprehensive collection of proposed models, links to related source code, available datasets, benchmark models, and fitting results. All this information is hoped to assist researchers in future studies. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic literature review presenting a detailed comparison of the results of current spatio-temporal GNN models in different domains. In addition, in its final part this review discusses current limitations and challenges in the application of spatio-temporal GNNs, such as comparability, reproducibility, explainability, poor information capacity, and scalability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Non-stationary Diffusion For Probabilistic Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04278v1)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Due to the dynamics of underlying physics and external influences, the uncertainty of time series often varies over time. However, existing Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) often fail to capture this non-stationary nature, constrained by their constant variance assumption from the additive noise model (ANM). In this paper, we innovatively utilize the Location-Scale Noise Model (LSNM) to relax the fixed uncertainty assumption of ANM. A diffusion-based probabilistic forecasting framework, termed Non-stationary Diffusion (NsDiff), is designed based on LSNM that is capable of modeling the changing pattern of uncertainty. Specifically, NsDiff combines a denoising diffusion-based conditional generative model with a pre-trained conditional mean and variance estimator, enabling adaptive endpoint distribution modeling. Furthermore, we propose an uncertainty-aware noise schedule, which dynamically adjusts the noise levels to accurately reflect the data uncertainty at each step and integrates the time-varying variances into the diffusion process. Extensive experiments conducted on nine real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate the superior performance of NsDiff compared to existing approaches. Code is available at https://github.com/wwy155/NsDiff.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as spotlight poster at ICML</p></details> |
| **[Generating Building-Level Heat Demand Time Series by Combining Occupancy Simulations and Thermal Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05427v3)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite various efforts, decarbonizing the heating sector remains a significant challenge. To tackle it by smart planning, the availability of highly resolved heating demand data is key. Several existing models provide heating demand only for specific applications. Typically, they either offer time series for a larger area or annual demand data on a building level, but not both simultaneously. Additionally, the diversity in heating demand across different buildings is often not considered. To address these limitations, this paper presents a novel method for generating temporally resolved heat demand time series at the building level using publicly available data. The approach integrates a thermal building model with stochastic occupancy simulations that account for variability in user behavior. As a result, the tool serves as a cost-effective resource for cross-sectoral energy system planning and policy development, particularly with a focus on the heating sector. The obtained data can be used to assess the impact of renovation and retrofitting strategies, or to analyze district heating expansion. To illustrate the potential applications of this approach, we conducted a case study in Puertollano (Spain), where we prepared a dataset of heating demand with hourly resolution for each of 9,298 residential buildings. This data was then used to compare two different pathways for the thermal renovation of these buildings. By relying on publicly available data, this method can be adapted and applied to various European regions, offering broad usability in energy system optimization and analysis of decarbonization strategies.</p></details> |  |
| **[STRGCN: Capturing Asynchronous Spatio-Temporal Dependencies for Irregular Multivariate Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04167v1)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Irregular multivariate time series (IMTS) are prevalent in real-world applications across many fields, where varying sensor frequencies and asynchronous measurements pose significant modeling challenges. Existing solutions often rely on a pre-alignment strategy to normalize data, which can distort intrinsic patterns and escalate computational and memory demands. Addressing these limitations, we introduce STRGCN, a Spatio-Temporal Relational Graph Convolutional Network that avoids pre-alignment and directly captures the complex interdependencies in IMTS by representing them as a fully connected graph. Each observation is represented as a node, allowing the model to effectively handle misaligned timestamps by mapping all inter-node relationships, thus faithfully preserving the asynchronous nature of the data. Moreover, we enhance this model with a hierarchical ``Sandwich'' structure that strategically aggregates nodes to optimize graph embeddings, reducing computational overhead while maintaining detailed local and global context. Extensive experiments on four public datasets demonstrate that STRGCN achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, competitive memory usage and training speed.</p></details> |  |
| **[Retrieval Augmented Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04163v1)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting uses historical data to predict future trends, leveraging the relationships between past observations and available features. In this paper, we propose RAFT, a retrieval-augmented time series forecasting method to provide sufficient inductive biases and complement the model's learning capacity. When forecasting the subsequent time frames, we directly retrieve historical data candidates from the training dataset with patterns most similar to the input, and utilize the future values of these candidates alongside the inputs to obtain predictions. This simple approach augments the model's capacity by externally providing information about past patterns via retrieval modules. Our empirical evaluations on ten benchmark datasets show that RAFT consistently outperforms contemporary baselines with an average win ratio of 86%.</p></details> |  |
| **[FilterTS: Comprehensive Frequency Filtering for Multivariate Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04158v1)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multivariate time series forecasting is crucial across various industries, where accurate extraction of complex periodic and trend components can significantly enhance prediction performance. However, existing models often struggle to capture these intricate patterns. To address these challenges, we propose FilterTS, a novel forecasting model that utilizes specialized filtering techniques based on the frequency domain. FilterTS introduces a Dynamic Cross-Variable Filtering Module, a key innovation that dynamically leverages other variables as filters to extract and reinforce shared variable frequency components across variables in multivariate time series. Additionally, a Static Global Filtering Module captures stable frequency components, identified throughout the entire training set. Moreover, the model is built in the frequency domain, converting time-domain convolutions into frequency-domain multiplicative operations to enhance computational efficiency. Extensive experimental results on eight real-world datasets have demonstrated that FilterTS significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of prediction accuracy and computational efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AAAI 2025</p></details> |
| **[Conditional Lagrangian Wasserstein Flow for Time Series Imputation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07550v2)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series imputation is important for numerous real-world applications. To overcome the limitations of diffusion model-based imputation methods, e.g., slow convergence in inference, we propose a novel method for time series imputation in this work, called Conditional Lagrangian Wasserstein Flow (CLWF). Following the principle of least action in Lagrangian mechanics, we learn the velocity by minimizing the corresponding kinetic energy. Moreover, to enhance the model's performance, we estimate the gradient of a task-specific potential function using a time-dependent denoising autoencoder and integrate it into the base estimator to reduce the sampling variance. Finally, the proposed method demonstrates competitive performance compared to other state-of-the-art imputation approaches.</p></details> | 20 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Uncertainty-Aware Digital Twins: Robust Model Predictive Control using Time-Series Deep Quantile Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10337v3)** | 2025-05-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Digital Twins, virtual replicas of physical systems that enable real-time monitoring, model updates, predictions, and decision-making, present novel avenues for proactive control strategies for autonomous systems. However, achieving real-time decision-making in Digital Twins considering uncertainty necessitates an efficient uncertainty quantification (UQ) approach and optimization driven by accurate predictions of system behaviors, which remains a challenge for learning-based methods. This paper presents a simultaneous multi-step robust model predictive control (MPC) framework that incorporates real-time decision-making with uncertainty awareness for Digital Twin systems. Leveraging a multistep ahead predictor named Time-Series Dense Encoder (TiDE) as the surrogate model, this framework differs from conventional MPC models that provide only one-step ahead predictions. In contrast, TiDE can predict future states within the prediction horizon in a one-shot, significantly accelerating MPC. Furthermore, quantile regression is employed with the training of TiDE to perform flexible while computationally efficient UQ on data uncertainty. Consequently, with the deep learning quantiles, the robust MPC problem is formulated into a deterministic optimization problem and provides a safety buffer that accommodates disturbances to enhance constraint satisfaction rate. As a result, the proposed method outperforms existing robust MPC methods by providing less-conservative UQ and has demonstrated efficacy in an engineering case study involving Directed Energy Deposition (DED) additive manufacturing. This proactive while uncertainty-aware control capability positions the proposed method as a potent tool for future Digital Twin applications and real-time process control in engineering systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[BRIDGE: Bootstrapping Text to Control Time-Series Generation via Multi-Agent Iterative Optimization and Diffusion Modelling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02445v3)** | 2025-05-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time-series Generation (TSG) is a prominent research area with broad applications in simulations, data augmentation, and counterfactual analysis. While existing methods have shown promise in unconditional single-domain TSG, real-world applications demand for cross-domain approaches capable of controlled generation tailored to domain-specific constraints and instance-level requirements. In this paper, we argue that text can provide semantic insights, domain information and instance-specific temporal patterns, to guide and improve TSG. We introduce ``Text-Controlled TSG'', a task focused on generating realistic time series by incorporating textual descriptions. To address data scarcity in this setting, we propose a novel LLM-based Multi-Agent framework that synthesizes diverse, realistic text-to-TS datasets. Furthermore, we introduce BRIDGE, a hybrid text-controlled TSG framework that integrates semantic prototypes with text description for supporting domain-level guidance. This approach achieves state-of-the-art generation fidelity on 11 of 12 datasets, and improves controllability by 12.52% on MSE and 6.34% MAE compared to no text input generation, highlighting its potential for generating tailored time-series data.</p></details> | ICML 2025 |
| **[Mitigating mode collapse in normalizing flows by annealing with an adaptive schedule: Application to parameter estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03652v1)** | 2025-05-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Normalizing flows (NFs) provide uncorrelated samples from complex distributions, making them an appealing tool for parameter estimation. However, the practical utility of NFs remains limited by their tendency to collapse to a single mode of a multimodal distribution. In this study, we show that annealing with an adaptive schedule based on the effective sample size (ESS) can mitigate mode collapse. We demonstrate that our approach can converge the marginal likelihood for a biochemical oscillator model fit to time-series data in ten-fold less computation time than a widely used ensemble Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method. We show that the ESS can also be used to reduce variance by pruning the samples. We expect these developments to be of general use for sampling with NFs and discuss potential opportunities for further improvements.</p></details> | 19 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Survival Analysis with Machine Learning for Predicting Li-ion Battery Remaining Useful Life](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13558v6)** | 2025-05-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Battery degradation significantly impacts the reliability and efficiency of energy storage systems, particularly in electric vehicles and industrial applications. Predicting the remaining useful life (RUL) of lithium-ion batteries is crucial for optimizing maintenance schedules, reducing costs, and improving safety. Traditional RUL prediction methods often struggle with nonlinear degradation patterns and uncertainty quantification. To address these challenges, we propose a hybrid survival analysis framework integrating survival data reconstruction, survival model learning, and survival probability estimation. Our approach transforms battery voltage time series into time-to-failure data using path signatures. The multiple Cox-based survival models and machine-learning-based methods, such as DeepHit and MTLR, are learned to predict battery failure-free probabilities over time. Experiments conducted on the Toyota battery and NASA battery datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving high time-dependent AUC and concordance index (C-Index) while maintaining a low integrated Brier score. The data and source codes for this work are available to the public at https://github.com/thinkxca/rul.</p></details> |  |
| **[A new membership inference attack that spots memorization in generative and predictive models: Loss-Based with Reference Model algorithm (LBRM)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03490v1)** | 2025-05-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative models can unintentionally memorize training data, posing significant privacy risks. This paper addresses the memorization phenomenon in time series imputation models, introducing the Loss-Based with Reference Model (LBRM) algorithm. The LBRM method leverages a reference model to enhance the accuracy of membership inference attacks, distinguishing between training and test data. Our contributions are twofold: first, we propose an innovative method to effectively extract and identify memorized training data, significantly improving detection accuracy. On average, without fine-tuning, the AUROC improved by approximately 40\%. With fine-tuning, the AUROC increased by approximately 60\%. Second, we validate our approach through membership inference attacks on two types of architectures designed for time series imputation, demonstrating the robustness and versatility of the LBRM approach in different contexts. These results highlight the significant enhancement in detection accuracy provided by the LBRM approach, addressing privacy risks in time series imputation models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Multivariate Time Series Forecasting via Calibrated Language Models with Privileged Knowledge Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02138v2)** | 2025-05-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multivariate time series forecasting (MTSF) endeavors to predict future observations given historical data, playing a crucial role in time series data management systems. With advancements in large language models (LLMs), recent studies employ textual prompt tuning to infuse the knowledge of LLMs into MTSF. However, the deployment of LLMs often suffers from low efficiency during the inference phase. To address this problem, we introduce TimeKD, an efficient MTSF framework that leverages the calibrated language models and privileged knowledge distillation. TimeKD aims to generate high-quality future representations from the proposed cross-modality teacher model and cultivate an effective student model. The cross-modality teacher model adopts calibrated language models (CLMs) with ground truth prompts, motivated by the paradigm of Learning Under Privileged Information (LUPI). In addition, we design a subtractive cross attention (SCA) mechanism to refine these representations. To cultivate an effective student model, we propose an innovative privileged knowledge distillation (PKD) mechanism including correlation and feature distillation. PKD enables the student to replicate the teacher's behavior while minimizing their output discrepancy. Extensive experiments on real data offer insight into the effectiveness, efficiency, and scalability of the proposed TimeKD.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICDE 2025</p></details> |
| **[On the asymptotics of extremal lp-blocks cluster inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.13521v4)** | 2025-05-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Extremes occur in stationary regularly varying time series as short periods with several large observations, known as extremal blocks. We study cluster statistics summarizing the behavior of functions acting on these extremal blocks. Examples of cluster statistics are the extremal index, cluster size probabilities, and other cluster indices. The purpose of our work is twofold. First, we state the asymptotic normality of block estimators for cluster inference based on consecutive observations with large lp-norms, for p < 0. The case p=$\alpha$, where $\alpha$ > 0 is the tail index of the time series, has specific nice properties thus we analyze the asymptotic of blocks estimators when approximating $\alpha$ using the Hill estimator. Second, we verify the conditions we require on classical models such as linear models and solutions of stochastic recurrence equations. Regarding linear models, we prove that the asymptotic variance of classical index cluster-based estimators is null as first conjectured in Hsing T. [26]. We illustrate our findings on simulations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Synergizing Large Language Models and Task-specific Models for Time Series Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05675v4)** | 2025-05-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In anomaly detection, methods based on large language models (LLMs) can incorporate expert knowledge by reading professional document, while task-specific small models excel at extracting normal data patterns and detecting value fluctuations from training data of target applications. Inspired by the human nervous system, where the brain stores expert knowledge and the peripheral nervous system and spinal cord handle specific tasks like withdrawal and knee-jerk reflexes, we propose CoLLaTe, a framework designed to facilitate collaboration between LLMs and task-specific models, leveraging the strengths of both models for anomaly detection. In particular, we first formulate the collaboration process and identify two key challenges in the collaboration: (1) the misalignment between the expression domains of the LLMs and task-specific small models, and (2) error accumulation arising from the predictions of both models. To address these challenges, we then introduce two key components in CoLLaTe: a model alignment module and a collaborative loss function. Through theoretical analysis and experimental validation, we demonstrate that these components effectively mitigate the identified challenges and achieve better performance than both LLM-based and task-specific models.</p></details> |  |
| **[FreDF: Learning to Forecast in the Frequency Domain](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02399v2)** | 2025-05-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series modeling presents unique challenges due to autocorrelation in both historical data and future sequences. While current research predominantly addresses autocorrelation within historical data, the correlations among future labels are often overlooked. Specifically, modern forecasting models primarily adhere to the Direct Forecast (DF) paradigm, generating multi-step forecasts independently and disregarding label autocorrelation over time. In this work, we demonstrate that the learning objective of DF is biased in the presence of label autocorrelation. To address this issue, we propose the Frequency-enhanced Direct Forecast (FreDF), which mitigates label autocorrelation by learning to forecast in the frequency domain, thereby reducing estimation bias. Our experiments show that FreDF significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods and is compatible with a variety of forecast models. Code is available at https://github.com/Master-PLC/FreDF.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICLR 2025</p></details> |
| **[A Cognitive-Mechanistic Human Reliability Analysis Framework: A Nuclear Power Plant Case Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18604v2)** | 2025-05-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional human reliability analysis (HRA) methods, such as IDHEAS-ECA, rely on expert judgment and empirical rules that often overlook the cognitive underpinnings of human error. Moreover, conducting human-in-the-loop experiments for advanced nuclear power plants is increasingly impractical due to novel interfaces and limited operational data. This study proposes a cognitive-mechanistic framework (COGMIF) that enhances the IDHEAS-ECA methodology by integrating an ACT-R-based human digital twin (HDT) with TimeGAN-augmented simulation. The ACT-R model simulates operator cognition, including memory retrieval, goal-directed procedural reasoning, and perceptual-motor execution, under high-fidelity scenarios derived from a high-temperature gas-cooled reactor (HTGR) simulator. To overcome the resource constraints of large-scale cognitive modeling, TimeGAN is trained on ACT-R-generated time-series data to produce high-fidelity synthetic operator behavior datasets. These simulations are then used to drive IDHEAS-ECA assessments, enabling scalable, mechanism-informed estimation of human error probabilities (HEPs). Comparative analyses with SPAR-H and sensitivity assessments demonstrate the robustness and practical advantages of the proposed COGMIF. Finally, procedural features are mapped onto a Bayesian network to quantify the influence of contributing factors, revealing key drivers of operational risk. This work offers a credible and computationally efficient pathway to integrate cognitive theory into industrial HRA practices.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Multimodal Paradox: How Added and Missing Modalities Shape Bias and Performance in Multimodal AI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03020v1)** | 2025-05-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal learning, which integrates diverse data sources such as images, text, and structured data, has proven superior to unimodal counterparts in high-stakes decision-making. However, while performance gains remain the gold standard for evaluating multimodal systems, concerns around bias and robustness are frequently overlooked. In this context, this paper explores two key research questions (RQs): (i) RQ1 examines whether adding a modality con-sistently enhances performance and investigates its role in shaping fairness measures, assessing whether it mitigates or amplifies bias in multimodal models; (ii) RQ2 investigates the impact of missing modalities at inference time, analyzing how multimodal models generalize in terms of both performance and fairness. Our analysis reveals that incorporating new modalities during training consistently enhances the performance of multimodal models, while fairness trends exhibit variability across different evaluation measures and datasets. Additionally, the absence of modalities at inference degrades performance and fairness, raising concerns about its robustness in real-world deployment. We conduct extensive experiments using multimodal healthcare datasets containing images, time series, and structured information to validate our findings.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025 Second Workshop on Responsible Generative AI</p></details> |

In order to test the inverse model, a synthetic dataset is created by running the model in forward mode with known parameter values to create soil temperature time series that can be used as observations for the inverse model. We show that it is not possible to obtain a reliable parameter estimation using a single observed soil temperature time series. Using measurements at two depths, reliable parameter estimates can be obtained although it is not possible to differentiate between latent and sensible heat fluxes. We apply the inverse model to urban flux tower data in Phoenix, United States, and show that the thermal conductivity, volumetric heat capacity, and the combined sensible-latent heat transfer coefficient can be reliably estimated using an observed value for the effective surface albedo. The resulting model accurately predicts the outgoing longwave radiation, conductive soil fluxes and the combined sensible-latent heat fluxes.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 5 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

Conversely, casualty ILS are appealing to insurers as an efficient capital management tool. However, securitizing casualty insurance risk is non-trivial, as it requires forecasting loss ratios for pools of insurance policies that have not yet been written, in addition to estimating how the underlying losses will develop over time within future accident years. In this paper, we lay out a Bayesian workflow that tackles these complexities by using: (1) theoretically informed time-series and state-space models to capture how loss ratios develop and change over time; (2) historic industry data to inform prior distributions of models fit to individual programs; (3) stacking to combine loss ratio predictions from candidate models, and (4) both prior predictive simulations and simulation-based calibration to aid model specification. Using historic Schedule P filings, we then show how our proposed Bayesian workflow can be used to assess and compare models across a variety of key model performance metrics evaluated on future accident year losses.</p></details> | 36 pages, 8 figures |
| **[SDA-GRIN for Adaptive Spatial-Temporal Multivariate Time Series Imputation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03954v2)** | 2025-05-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In various applications, the multivariate time series often suffers from missing data. This issue can significantly disrupt systems that rely on the data. Spatial and temporal dependencies can be leveraged to impute the missing samples. Existing imputation methods often ignore dynamic changes in spatial dependencies. We propose a Spatial Dynamic Aware Graph Recurrent Imputation Network (SDA-GRIN) which is capable of capturing dynamic changes in spatial dependencies.SDA-GRIN leverages a multi-head attention mechanism to adapt graph structures with time. SDA-GRIN models multivariate time series as a sequence of temporal graphs and uses a recurrent message-passing architecture for imputation. We evaluate SDA-GRIN on four real-world datasets: SDA-GRIN improves MSE by 9.51% for the AQI and 9.40% for AQI-36. On the PEMS-BAY dataset, it achieves a 1.94% improvement in MSE. Detailed ablation study demonstrates the effect of window sizes and missing data on the performance of the method. Project page:https://ameskandari.github.io/sda-grin/</p></details> |  |
| **[Re-purposing a modular origami manipulator into an adaptive physical computer for machine learning and robotic perception](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02744v1)** | 2025-05-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Physical computing has emerged as a powerful tool for performing intelligent tasks directly in the mechanical domain of functional materials and robots, reducing our reliance on the more traditional COMS computers. However, no systematic study explains how mechanical design can influence physical computing performance. This study sheds insights into this question by repurposing an origami-inspired modular robotic manipulator into an adaptive physical reservoir and systematically evaluating its computing capacity with different physical configurations, input setups, and computing tasks. By challenging this adaptive reservoir computer to complete the classical NARMA benchmark tasks, this study shows that its time series emulation performance directly correlates to the Peak Similarity Index (PSI), which quantifies the frequency spectrum correlation between the target output and reservoir dynamics. The adaptive reservoir also demonstrates perception capabilities, accurately extracting its payload weight and orientation information from the intrinsic dynamics. Importantly, such information extraction capability can be measured by the spatial correlation between nodal dynamics within the reservoir body. Finally, by integrating shape memory alloy (SMA) actuation, this study demonstrates how to exploit such computing power embodied in the physical body for practical, robotic operations. This study provides a strategic framework for harvesting computing power from soft robots and functional materials, demonstrating how design parameters and input selection can be configured based on computing task requirements. Extending this framework to bio-inspired adaptive materials, prosthetics, and self-adaptive soft robotic systems could enable next-generation embodied intelligence, where the physical structure can compute and interact with their digital counterparts.</p></details> |  |

Graphs are generated based on latent positions under the random dot product graph regime. We assign group membership to each node. When evolving through time, the latent position of each node will change based on its current position and two attractors, which are defined to be the centers of the latent positions of all of its neighbors who share its group membership or who have different group membership than it. Parameters are assigned to the attractors to quantify the amount of influence that the attractors have on the trajectory of the latent position of each node. We developed estimators for the parameters, demonstrated their consistency, and established convergence rates under specific assumptions. Through the ABCDPRGM, we provided a novel framework for quantifying and understanding the underlying forces influencing the polarizing or flocking behaviors in dynamic network data.</p></details> |  |

However, this approach lacks temporal constraints when computing temporal features and does not utilize cumulative historical series effectively.To address these limitations, we propose the Structured Channel-wise Transformer with Cumulative Historical state (SCFormer). SCFormer introduces temporal constraints to all linear transformations, including the query, key, and value matrices, as well as the fully connected layers within the Transformer. Additionally, SCFormer employs High-order Polynomial Projection Operators (HiPPO) to deal with cumulative historical time series, allowing the model to incorporate information beyond the look-back window during prediction. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that SCFormer significantly outperforms mainstream baselines, highlighting its effectiveness in enhancing time series forecasting.

Seizures disrupt coherence and functional connectivity, necessitating precise detection. Departing from traditional parametric approaches, we utilize the Wold decomposition, representing general time series as autoregressive processes with infinite lags, which are truncated and estimated around the change point. Our detection procedure employs an initial estimator that systematically searches across time points. We examine the localization error and its dependence on time series properties and sample size. To enhance accuracy, we introduce an optimal rate method with an asymptotic distribution, facilitating the construction of confidence intervals. The proposed method effectively identifies seizure onset in EEG data and extends to event detection in video data. Comprehensive numerical experiments demonstrate its superior performance compared to existing techniques.</p></details> | <details><summary>Fixed...</summary><p>Fixed minor typos in V1</p></details> |

Unlike traditional sensor-dependent methods, our approach uses AI-powered vision models to extract lane-specific features, including vehicle count, occupancy, and truck percentage, without relying on costly hardware or complex road modeling. We introduce a novel dataset containing 73,139 lane-wise samples, annotated with four classes of expert-validated anomalies: three traffic-related anomalies (lane blockage and recovery, foreign object intrusion, and sustained congestion) and one sensor-related anomaly (camera angle shift). Our multi-branch detection system integrates deep learning, rule-based logic, and machine learning to improve robustness and precision. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods in precision, recall, and F1-score, providing a cost-effective and scalable solution for real-world intelligent transportation systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Data Compression for Time Series Modelling: A Case Study of Smart Grid Demand Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02606v1)** | 2025-05-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Efficient time series forecasting is essential for smart energy systems, enabling accurate predictions of energy demand, renewable resource availability, and grid stability. However, the growing volume of high-frequency data from sensors and IoT devices poses challenges for storage and transmission. This study explores Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT)-based data compression as a solution to these challenges while ensuring forecasting accuracy. A case study of a seawater supply system in Hirtshals, Denmark, operating under dynamic weather, operational schedules, and seasonal trends, is used for evaluation. Biorthogonal wavelets of varying orders were applied to compress data at different rates. Three forecasting models - Ordinary Least Squares (OLS), XGBoost, and the Time Series Dense Encoder (TiDE) - were tested to assess the impact of compression on forecasting performance. Lossy compression rates up to $r_{\mathrm{lossy}} = 0.999$ were analyzed, with the Normalized Mutual Information (NMI) metric quantifying the relationship between compression and information retention. Results indicate that wavelet-based compression can retain essential features for accurate forecasting when applied carefully. XGBoost proved highly robust to compression artifacts, maintaining stable performance across diverse compression rates. In contrast, OLS demonstrated sensitivity to smooth wavelets and high compression rates, while TiDE showed some variability but remained competitive. This study highlights the potential of wavelet-based compression for scalable, efficient data management in smart energy systems without sacrificing forecasting accuracy. The findings are relevant to other fields requiring high-frequency time series forecasting, including climate modeling, water supply systems, and industrial operations.</p></details> |  |

Traditional assignment methods prioritize spatial efficiency, but often overlook behavioral alignment between passengers and drivers, which can significantly impact user satisfaction. MCM addresses this gap by learning personalized passenger comfort zones using gradient-boosted decision tree classifiers trained on labeled ride data, and by modeling driver behavior through empirical operating profiles constructed from time-series driving features. Compatibility between a passenger and a driver is computed as the closed-form volume of intersection between their respective feature-space regions. These compatibility scores are integrated into a utility-based matching algorithm that balances comfort and proximity through a tunable trade-off parameter. We validate the framework using a Unity-based driving simulator with real-time passenger feedback, demonstrating that MCM enables more personalized and socially acceptable matchings while maintaining high levels of operational performance.</p></details> |  |

Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as a new paradigm for time series analytics by leveraging the shared sequential nature of textual data and time series. However, a fundamental cross-modality gap between time series and LLMs exists, as LLMs are pre-trained on textual corpora and are not inherently optimized for time series. Many recent proposals are designed to address this issue. In this survey, we provide an up-to-date overview of LLMs-based cross-modality modeling for time series analytics. We first introduce a taxonomy that classifies existing approaches into four groups based on the type of textual data employed for time series modeling. We then summarize key cross-modality strategies, e.g., alignment and fusion, and discuss their applications across a range of downstream tasks. Furthermore, we conduct experiments on multimodal datasets from different application domains to investigate effective combinations of textual data and cross-modality strategies for enhancing time series analytics. Finally, we suggest several promising directions for future research. This survey is designed for a range of professionals, researchers, and practitioners interested in LLM-based time series modeling.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IJCAI 2025 Survey Track</p></details> |

We consider a variant, where given a set of trajectories and a number of parts, we jointly partition the set of trajectories and learn linear dynamical system (LDS) models for each part, so as to minimize the maximum error across all the models. We present globally convergent methods and EM heuristics, accompanied by promising computational results. The key highlight of this method is that it does not require a predefined hidden state dimension but instead provides an upper bound. Additionally, it offers guidance for determining regularization in the system identification.</p></details> |  |
| **[T2S: High-resolution Time Series Generation with Text-to-Series Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02417v1)** | 2025-05-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-Time Series generation holds significant potential to address challenges such as data sparsity, imbalance, and limited availability of multimodal time series datasets across domains. While diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in Text-to-X (e.g., vision and audio data) generation, their use in time series generation remains in its nascent stages. Existing approaches face two critical limitations: (1) the lack of systematic exploration of general-proposed time series captions, which are often domain-specific and struggle with generalization; and (2) the inability to generate time series of arbitrary lengths, limiting their applicability to real-world scenarios. In this work, we first categorize time series captions into three levels: point-level, fragment-level, and instance-level. Additionally, we introduce a new fragment-level dataset containing over 600,000 high-resolution time series-text pairs. Second, we propose Text-to-Series (T2S), a diffusion-based framework that bridges the gap between natural language and time series in a domain-agnostic manner. T2S employs a length-adaptive variational autoencoder to encode time series of varying lengths into consistent latent embeddings. On top of that, T2S effectively aligns textual representations with latent embeddings by utilizing Flow Matching and employing Diffusion Transformer as the denoiser. We train T2S in an interleaved paradigm across multiple lengths, allowing it to generate sequences of any desired length. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that T2S achieves state-of-the-art performance across 13 datasets spanning 12 domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the 34th International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI 2025)</p></details> |

Traditional machine learning models exhibit limitations in this forecasting task constrained by their restricted model capacity. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs), with their greatly expanded parameter spaces, demonstrate promising potential for modeling complex dependencies in temporal sequences. However, existing LLM-based approaches typically focus on fixed-length patch analysis due to the Transformer architecture, ignoring market data's multi-scale pattern characteristics. In this study, we propose $LLM4FTS$, a novel framework that enhances LLM capabilities for temporal sequence modeling through learnable patch segmentation and dynamic wavelet convolution modules. Specifically,we first employ K-means++ clustering based on DTW distance to identify scale-invariant patterns in market data. Building upon pattern recognition results, we introduce adaptive patch segmentation that partitions temporal sequences while preserving maximal pattern integrity. To accommodate time-varying frequency characteristics, we devise a dynamic wavelet convolution module that emulates discrete wavelet transformation with enhanced flexibility in capturing time-frequency features. These three modules work together to improve large language model's ability to handle scale-invariant patterns in financial time series. Extensive experiments on real-world financial datasets substantiate the framework's efficacy, demonstrating superior performance in capturing complex market patterns and achieving state-of-the-art results in stock return prediction. The successful deployment in practical trading systems confirms its real-world applicability, representing a significant advancement in LLM applications for financial forecasting.</p></details> | 12 pages, 9figures |

Most available estimation methods can be divided into two categories: the covariance-based under asymptotically-identifiable assumption and the autocovariance-based with white idiosyncratic noise. This paper follows the autocovariance-based framework and develops a novel weight-calibrated method to improve the estimation performance. It adopts a linear projection to tackle high-dimensionality, and employs a reduced-rank autoregression formulation. The asymptotic theory of the proposed method is established, relaxing the assumption on white noise. Additionally, we make the first attempt in the literature by providing a systematic theoretical comparison among the covariance-based, the standard autocovariance-based, and our proposed weight-calibrated autocovariance-based methods in the presence of factors with different strengths. Extensive simulations are conducted to showcase the superior finite-sample performance of our proposed method, as well as to validate the newly established theory. The superiority of our proposal is further illustrated through the analysis of one financial and one macroeconomic data sets.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This version includes the supplementary material of the paper</p></details> |

These models rely primarily on utilizing ground motion records for tasks such as earthquake event classification, localization, earthquake early warning systems, and structural health monitoring. However, the extent to which these models truly extract meaningful patterns from these complex time-series signals remains underexplored. In this study, our objective is to evaluate the degree to which auxiliary information, such as seismic phase arrival times or seismic station distribution within a network, dominates the process of deep learning from ground motion records, potentially hindering its effectiveness. Our experimental results reveal a strong dependence on the highly correlated Primary (P) and Secondary (S) phase arrival times. These findings expose a critical gap in the current research landscape, highlighting the lack of robust methodologies for deep learning from single-station ground motion recordings that do not rely on auxiliary inputs.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 Pag...</summary><p>9 Pages, 12 Figures, 5 Tables</p></details> |

Existing approaches often tightly couple representation learning with specific downstream tasks in an end-to-end manner, failed to analyze the learned representations individually and explicitly, limiting their reusability and generalization. This paper conducts the first systematic comparative study of LOB representation learning, aiming to identify the effective way of extracting transferable, compact features that capture essential LOB properties. We introduce LOBench, a standardized benchmark with real China A-share market data, offering curated datasets, unified preprocessing, consistent evaluation metrics, and strong baselines. Extensive experiments validate the sufficiency and necessity of LOB representations for various downstream tasks and highlight their advantages over both the traditional task-specific end-to-end models and the advanced representation learning models for general time series.

While adversarial defense is well-studied in Computer Vision (CV), the TSC field has primarily relied on adversarial training (AT), which is computationally expensive. In this paper, five data augmentation-based defense methods tailored for time series are developed, with the most computationally intensive method among them increasing the computational resources by only 14.07% compared to the original TSC model. Moreover, the deployment process for these methods is straightforward. By leveraging these advantages of our methods, we create two combined methods. One of these methods is an ensemble of all the proposed techniques, which not only provides better defense performance than PGD-based AT but also enhances the generalization ability of TSC models. Moreover, the computational resources required for our ensemble are less than one-third of those required for PGD-based AT. These methods advance robust TSC in data mining. Furthermore, as foundation models are increasingly explored for time series feature learning, our work provides insights into integrating data augmentation-based adversarial defense with large-scale pre-trained models in future research.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 8 figures.

Our approach enhances the completeness of datasets by systematically incorporating periodic components into the imputation process, thereby preserving key statistical properties, including mean and variance. We conduct a comparative analysis of various imputation techniques, demonstrating that our VBPBB-enhanced approach consistently outperforms traditional methods in maintaining the statistical structure of the original dataset. The results of our study underscore the robustness and reliability of VBPBB-enhanced imputation, highlighting its potential for broader application in real-world datasets, particularly in fields such as healthcare, where data quality is critical. These findings provide a robust framework for improving the accuracy of imputed datasets, offering substantial implications for advancing research methodologies across scientific and analytical contexts.

Accurate prediction of stream water temperature at fine spatial resolutions (i.e., fine scales, $\leq$ 1 km) enables precise interventions to maintain water quality and protect aquatic habitats. Although spatiotemporal models have made substantial progress in spatially coarse time series modeling, challenges persist in predicting at fine spatial scales due to the lack of data at that scale.To address the problem of insufficient fine-scale data, we propose a Multi-Scale Graph Learning (MSGL) method. This method employs a multi-task learning framework where coarse-scale graph learning, bolstered by larger datasets, simultaneously enhances fine-scale graph learning. Although existing multi-scale or multi-resolution methods integrate data from different spatial scales, they often overlook the spatial correspondences across graph structures at various scales. To address this, our MSGL introduces an additional learning task, cross-scale interpolation learning, which leverages the hydrological connectedness of stream locations across coarse- and fine-scale graphs to establish cross-scale connections, thereby enhancing overall model performance. Furthermore, we have broken free from the mindset that multi-scale learning is limited to synchronous training by proposing an Asynchronous Multi-Scale Graph Learning method (ASYNC-MSGL). Extensive experiments demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our method for anti-sparse downscaling of daily stream temperatures in the Delaware River Basin, USA, highlighting its potential utility for water resources monitoring and management.</p></details> | <details><summary>AAAI-...</summary><p>AAAI-25, Multi-scale deep learning approach for spatial downscaling of geospatial data with sparse observations</p></details> |

To accurately identify causal connectivity for such specified objectives, it is necessary to properly address the influence of all other nodes within the network. The proposed procedure herein starts with the estimation of a low-dimensional representation of the other nodes in the network utilizing (frequency-domain-based) spectral dynamic principal component analysis (sDPCA). The resulting scores can then be removed from the nodes of interest, thus eliminating the confounding effect of other nodes within the HDN. Accordingly, causal interactions can be dissected between nodes that are isolated from the effects of the network. Extensive simulations have demonstrated the effectiveness of this approach as a tool for causality analysis in complex time series networks. The proposed methodology has also been shown to be applicable to multichannel EEG networks.</p></details> |  |

It enables adaptive, on-demand management of the network based on the objectives of the network operators. In this paper, we propose an innovative three-step framework for intent-driven network management based on Generative AI (GenAI) algorithms. First, we fine-tune a Large Language Model (LLM) on a custom dataset using a Quantized Low-Rank Adapter (QLoRA) to enable memory-efficient intent processing within limited computational resources. A Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) module is included to support dynamic decision-making. Second, we utilize a transformer architecture for time series forecasting to predict key parameters, such as power consumption, traffic load, and packet drop rate, to facilitate intent validation proactively. Lastly, we introduce a Hierarchical Decision Transformer with Goal Awareness (HDTGA) to optimize the selection and orchestration of network applications and hence, optimize the network. Our intent guidance and processing approach improves BERTScore by 6% and the semantic similarity score by 9% compared to the base LLM model. Again, the proposed predictive intent validation approach can successfully rule out the performance-degrading intents with an average of 88% accuracy.

This work introduces ForTy, a benchmark for global-scale FORest TYpes mapping using multi-temporal satellite data1. The benchmark comprises 200,000 time series of image patches, each consisting of Sentinel-2, Sentinel-1, climate, and elevation data. Each time series captures variations at monthly or seasonal cadence. Per-pixel annotations, including forest types and other land use classes, support image segmentation tasks. Unlike most existing land use products that often categorize all forest areas into a single class, our benchmark differentiates between three forest types classes: natural forest, planted forest, and tree crops. By leveraging multiple public data sources, we achieve global coverage with this benchmark. We evaluate the forest types dataset using several baseline models, including convolution neural networks and transformer-based models. Additionally, we propose a novel transformer-based model specifically designed to handle multi-modal, multi-temporal satellite data for forest types mapping.

However, standard deep learning (DL) struggles to learn generalizable features in low-data environments due to model overfitting. We propose a versatile yet data-efficient framework, Intelligently Augmented Contrastive Tensor Factorization (ITA-CTF), to learn effective representations from multi-dimensional time series. The CTF module learns core explanatory components of the time series (e.g., sensor factors, temporal factors), and importantly, their joint dependencies. Notably, unlike standard tensor factorization (TF), the CTF module incorporates a new contrastive loss optimization to induce similarity learning and class-awareness into the learnt representations for better classification performance. To strengthen this contrastive learning, the preceding ITA module generates targeted but informative augmentations that highlight realistic intra-class patterns in the original data, while preserving class-wise properties. This is achieved by dynamically sampling a "soft" class prototype to guide the warping of each query data sample, which results in an augmentation that is intelligently pattern-mixed between the "soft" class prototype and the query sample. These augmentations enable the CTF module to recognize complex intra-class variations despite the limited original training data, and seek out invariant class-wise properties for accurate classification performance.

| **[Enhanced Prediction Model for Time Series Characterized by GARCH via Interval Type-2 Fuzzy Inference System](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01675v1)** | 2025-05-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>GARCH-type time series (characterized by Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity) exhibit pronounced volatility, autocorrelation, and heteroskedasticity. To address these challenges and enhance predictive accuracy, this study introduces a hybrid forecasting framework that integrates the Interval Type-2 Fuzzy Inference System (IT2FIS) with the GARCH model. Leveraging the interval-based uncertainty representation of IT2FIS and the volatility-capturing capability of GARCH, the proposed model effectively mitigates the adverse impact of heteroskedasticity on prediction reliability. Specifically, the GARCH component estimates conditional variance, which is subsequently incorporated into the Gaussian membership functions of IT2FIS. This integration transforms IT2FIS into an adaptive variable-parameter system, dynamically aligning with the time-varying volatility of the target series. Through systematic parameter optimization, the framework not only captures intricate volatility patterns but also accounts for heteroskedasticity and epistemic uncertainties during modeling, thereby improving both prediction precision and model robustness. Experimental validation employs diverse datasets, including air quality concentration, urban traffic flow, and energy consumption. Comparative analyses are conducted against models: the GARCH-Takagi-Sugeno-Kang (GARCH-TSK) model, fixed-variance time series models, the GARCH-Gated Recurrent Unit (GARCH-GRU), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. The results indicate that the proposed model achieves superior predictive performance across the majority of test scenarios in error metrics. These findings underscore the effectiveness of hybrid approaches in forecasting uncertainty for GARCH-type time series, highlighting their practical utility in real-world time series forecasting applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>40 pa...</summary><p>40 pages, 13 figures, references added</p></details> |

Despite progress, existing studies predominantly focus on tasks like financial text summarization, question-answering, and stock movement prediction (binary classification), the application of LLMs to financial risk prediction remains underexplored. Addressing this gap, in this paper, we introduce RiskLabs, a novel framework that leverages LLMs to analyze and predict financial risks. RiskLabs uniquely integrates multimodal financial data, including textual and vocal information from Earnings Conference Calls (ECCs), market-related time series data, and contextual news data to improve financial risk prediction. Empirical results demonstrate RiskLabs' effectiveness in forecasting both market volatility and variance. Through comparative experiments, we examine the contributions of different data sources to financial risk assessment and highlight the crucial role of LLMs in this process. We also discuss the challenges associated with using LLMs for financial risk prediction and explore the potential of combining them with multimodal data for this purpose.</p></details> |  |
| **[Neural and Time-Series Approaches for Pricing Weather Derivatives: Performance and Regime Adaptation Using Satellite Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12013v2)** | 2025-05-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper studies pricing of weather-derivative (WD) contracts on temperature and precipitation. For temperature-linked strangles in Toronto and Chicago, we benchmark a harmonic-regression/ARMA model against a feed-forward neural network (NN), finding that the NN reduces out-of-sample mean-squared error (MSE) and materially shifts December fair values relative to both the time-series model and the industry-standard Historic Burn Approach (HBA). For precipitation, we employ a compound Poisson--Gamma framework: shape and scale parameters are estimated via maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) and via a convolutional neural network (CNN) trained on 30-day rainfall sequences spanning multiple seasons. The CNN adaptively learns season-specific $(\alpha,\beta)$ mappings, thereby capturing heterogeneity across regimes that static i.i.d.\ fits miss. At valuation, we assume days are i.i.d.\ $\Gamma(\hat{\alpha},\hat{\beta})$ within each regime and apply a mean-count approximation (replacing the Poisson count by its mean ($n\hat{\lambda}$) to derive closed-form strangle prices. Exploratory analysis of 1981--2023 NASA POWER data confirms pronounced seasonal heterogeneity in $(\alpha,\beta)$ between summer and winter, demonstrating that static global fits are inadequate. Back-testing on Toronto and Chicago grids shows that our regime-adaptive CNN yields competitive valuations and underscores how model choice can shift strangle prices. Payoffs are evaluated analytically when possible and by simulation elsewhere, enabling a like-for-like comparison of forecasting and valuation methods.</p></details> | 23 pages, 31 figures |
| **[How Effective are Large Time Series Models in Hydrology? A Study on Water Level Forecasting in Everglades](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01415v1)** | 2025-05-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Everglades play a crucial role in flood and drought regulation, water resource planning, and ecosystem management in the surrounding regions. However, traditional physics-based and statistical methods for predicting water levels often face significant challenges, including high computational costs and limited adaptability to diverse or unforeseen conditions. Recent advancements in large time series models have demonstrated the potential to address these limitations, with state-of-the-art deep learning and foundation models achieving remarkable success in time series forecasting across various domains. Despite this progress, their application to critical environmental systems, such as the Everglades, remains underexplored. In this study, we fill the gap by investigating twelve task-specific models and five time series foundation models across six categories for a real-world application focused on water level prediction in the Everglades. Our primary results show that the foundation model, Chronos, significantly outperforms all other models while the remaining foundation models exhibit relatively poor performance. Moreover, the performance of task-specific models varies with the model architectures. Lastly, we discuss the possible reasons for the varying performance of models.</p></details> |  |

This study analyzes transportation patterns using two datasets: the NYC Taxi Trip dataset from New York City and the Pathao Food Trip dataset from Dhaka, Bangladesh. Our goal is to identify key trends in demand, peak times, and important geographical hotspots. We start with Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the basic characteristics of the datasets. Next, we perform geospatial analysis to map out high-demand and low-demand regions. We use the SARIMAX model for time series analysis to forecast demand patterns, capturing seasonal and weekly variations. Lastly, we apply clustering techniques to identify significant areas of high and low demand. Our findings provide valuable insights for optimizing fleet management and resource allocation in both passenger transport and food delivery services. These insights can help improve service efficiency, better meet customer needs, and enhance urban transportation systems in diverse urban environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Predicting the Price of Gold in the Financial Markets Using Hybrid Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01402v1)** | 2025-05-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predicting the price that has the least error and can provide the best and highest accuracy has been one of the most challenging issues and one of the most critical concerns among capital market activists and researchers. Therefore, a model that can solve problems and provide results with high accuracy is one of the topics of interest among researchers. In this project, using time series prediction models such as ARIMA to estimate the price, variables, and indicators related to technical analysis show the behavior of traders involved in involving psychological factors for the model. By linking all of these variables to stepwise regression, we identify the best variables influencing the prediction of the variable. Finally, we enter the selected variables as inputs to the artificial neural network. In other words, we want to call this whole prediction process the "ARIMA_Stepwise Regression_Neural Network" model and try to predict the price of gold in international financial markets. This approach is expected to be able to be used to predict the types of stocks, commodities, currency pairs, financial market indicators, and other items used in local and international financial markets. Moreover, a comparison between the results of this method and time series methods is also expressed. Finally, based on the results, it can be seen that the resulting hybrid model has the highest accuracy compared to the time series method, regression, and stepwise regression.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bayesian Emulation of Grey-Box Multi-Model Ensembles Exploiting Known Interior Structure](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08367v2)** | 2025-05-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Computer models are widely used to study complex real world physical systems. However, there are major limitations to their direct use including: their complex structure; large numbers of inputs and outputs; and long evaluation times. Bayesian emulators are an effective means of addressing these challenges providing fast and efficient statistical approximation for computer model outputs. It is commonly assumed that computer models behave like a ``black-box'' function with no knowledge of the output prior to its evaluation. This ensures that emulators are generalisable but potentially limits their accuracy compared with exploiting such knowledge of constrained or structured output behaviour. We assume a ``grey-box'' computer model and develop a methodological toolkit for its analysis. This includes: multi-model ensemble subsampling to identifying a representative model subset to reduce computational expense; constructing a targeted Bayesian design for optimisation or decision support; a ``divide-and-conquer'' approach to emulating sums of outputs; structured emulators exploiting known constrained and structured behaviour of constituent outputs through splitting the parameter space and imposing truncations; emulation of sums of time series outputs; and emulation of multi-model ensemble outputs. Combining these methods establishes a hierarchical emulation framework which achieves greater physical interpretability and more accurate emulator predictions. This research is motivated by and applied to the commercially important TNO OLYMPUS Well Control Optimisation Challenge from the petroleum industry which we re-express as a decision support under uncertainty problem. We thus encourage users to examine their ``black-box'' simulators to achieve superior emulator accuracy.</p></details> | 50 pages, 15 figures |
| **[Early Detection of Patient Deterioration from Real-Time Wearable Monitoring System](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01305v1)** | 2025-05-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Early detection of patient deterioration is crucial for reducing mortality rates. Heart rate data has shown promise in assessing patient health, and wearable devices offer a cost-effective solution for real-time monitoring. However, extracting meaningful insights from diverse heart rate data and handling missing values in wearable device data remain key challenges. To address these challenges, we propose TARL, an innovative approach that models the structural relationships of representative subsequences, known as shapelets, in heart rate time series. TARL creates a shapelet-transition knowledge graph to model shapelet dynamics in heart rate time series, indicating illness progression and potential future changes. We further introduce a transition-aware knowledge embedding to reinforce relationships among shapelets and quantify the impact of missing values, enabling the formulation of comprehensive heart rate representations. These representations capture explanatory structures and predict future heart rate trends, aiding early illness detection. We collaborate with physicians and nurses to gather ICU patient heart rate data from wearables and diagnostic metrics assessing illness severity for evaluating deterioration. Experiments on real-world ICU data demonstrate that TARL achieves both high reliability and early detection. A case study further showcases TARL's explainable detection process, highlighting its potential as an AI-driven tool to assist clinicians in recognizing early signs of patient deterioration.</p></details> |  |
| **[DConAD: A Differencing-based Contrastive Representation Learning Framework for Time Series Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14204v2)** | 2025-05-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series anomaly detection holds notable importance for risk identification and fault detection across diverse application domains. Unsupervised learning methods have become popular because they have no requirement for labels. However, due to the challenges posed by the multiplicity of abnormal patterns, the sparsity of anomalies, and the growth of data scale and complexity, these methods often fail to capture robust and representative dependencies within the time series for identifying anomalies. To enhance the ability of models to capture normal patterns of time series and avoid the retrogression of modeling ability triggered by the dependencies on high-quality prior knowledge, we propose a differencing-based contrastive representation learning framework for time series anomaly detection (DConAD). Specifically, DConAD generates differential data to provide additional information about time series and utilizes transformer-based architecture to capture spatiotemporal dependencies, which enhances the robustness of unbiased representation learning ability. Furthermore, DConAD implements a novel KL divergence-based contrastive learning paradigm that only uses positive samples to avoid deviation from reconstruction and deploys the stop-gradient strategy to compel convergence. Extensive experiments on five public datasets show the superiority and effectiveness of DConAD compared with nine baselines. The code is available at https://github.com/shaieesss/DConAD.</p></details> |  |
| **[Empirical Comparison of Lightweight Forecasting Models for Seasonal and Non-Seasonal Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01163v1)** | 2025-05-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate time series forecasting is essential in many real-time applications that demand both high predictive accuracy and computational efficiency. This study provides an empirical comparison between a Polynomial Classifier and a Radial Basis Function Neural Network (RBFNN) across four real-world time series datasets (weather conditions, gold prices, crude oil prices, and beer production volumes) that cover both seasonal and nonseasonal patterns. Model performance is evaluated by forecasting accuracy (using Mean Absolute Error, Root Mean Squared Error, and Coefficient of Variation of Root Mean Squared Error) and computational time to assess each model's viability for real time forecasting. The results show that the PC yields more accurate and faster forecasts for non seasonal series, whereas the RBFNN performs better on series with pronounced seasonal patterns. From an interpretability standpoint, the polynomial model offers a simpler, more transparent structure (in contrast to the black box nature of neural network), which is advantageous for understanding and trust in real time decision making. The performance differences between PC and RBFNN are statistically significant, as confirmed by paired t tests and Wilcoxon signed rank tests. These findings provide practical guidance for model selection in time series forecasting, indicating that PC may be preferable for quick, interpretable forecasts in non-seasonal contexts, whereas RBFNN is superior for capturing complex seasonal behaviors</p></details> |  |
| **[Dual-Forecaster: A Multimodal Time Series Model Integrating Descriptive and Predictive Texts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01135v1)** | 2025-05-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most existing single-modal time series models rely solely on numerical series, which suffer from the limitations imposed by insufficient information. Recent studies have revealed that multimodal models can address the core issue by integrating textual information. However, these models focus on either historical or future textual information, overlooking the unique contributions each plays in time series forecasting. Besides, these models fail to grasp the intricate relationships between textual and time series data, constrained by their moderate capacity for multimodal comprehension. To tackle these challenges, we propose Dual-Forecaster, a pioneering multimodal time series model that combines both descriptively historical textual information and predictive textual insights, leveraging advanced multimodal comprehension capability empowered by three well-designed cross-modality alignment techniques. Our comprehensive evaluations on fifteen multimodal time series datasets demonstrate that Dual-Forecaster is a distinctly effective multimodal time series model that outperforms or is comparable to other state-of-the-art models, highlighting the superiority of integrating textual information for time series forecasting. This work opens new avenues in the integration of textual information with numerical time series data for multimodal time series analysis.</p></details> |  |

I propose to generalize RUC into a model agnostic feature optimization framework for multivariate time series forecasting. The core idea is to synthesize candidate feature programs by randomly composing operators from a domain specific grammar, score candidates rapidly with inexpensive surrogate models on rolling windows, and filter instability via nested cross validation and information theoretic shrinkage. By decoupling feature discovery from GPU heavy deep learning, the method promises faster iteration cycles, lower energy consumption, and greater interpretability. Societal relevance: accurate, transparent forecasting tools empower resource constrained institutions, energy regulators, climate risk NGOs to make data driven decisions without proprietary black box models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Locally Private Sampling with Public Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08791v2)** | 2025-05-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Local differential privacy (LDP) is increasingly employed in privacy-preserving machine learning to protect user data before sharing it with an untrusted aggregator. Most LDP methods assume that users possess only a single data record, which is a significant limitation since users often gather extensive datasets (e.g., images, text, time-series data) and frequently have access to public datasets. To address this limitation, we propose a locally private sampling framework that leverages both the private and public datasets of each user. Specifically, we assume each user has two distributions: $p$ and $q$ that represent their private dataset and the public dataset, respectively. The objective is to design a mechanism that generates a private sample approximating $p$ while simultaneously preserving $q$. We frame this objective as a minimax optimization problem using $f$-divergence as the utility measure. We fully characterize the minimax optimal mechanisms for general $f$-divergences provided that $p$ and $q$ are discrete distributions. Remarkably, we demonstrate that this optimal mechanism is universal across all $f$-divergences. Experiments validate the effectiveness of our minimax optimal sampler compared to the state-of-the-art locally private sampler.</p></details> |  |
| **[FreCT: Frequency-augmented Convolutional Transformer for Robust Time Series Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00941v1)** | 2025-05-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series anomaly detection is critical for system monitoring and risk identification, across various domains, such as finance and healthcare. However, for most reconstruction-based approaches, detecting anomalies remains a challenge due to the complexity of sequential patterns in time series data. On the one hand, reconstruction-based techniques are susceptible to computational deviation stemming from anomalies, which can lead to impure representations of normal sequence patterns. On the other hand, they often focus on the time-domain dependencies of time series, while ignoring the alignment of frequency information beyond the time domain. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Frequency-augmented Convolutional Transformer (FreCT). FreCT utilizes patch operations to generate contrastive views and employs an improved Transformer architecture integrated with a convolution module to capture long-term dependencies while preserving local topology information. The introduced frequency analysis based on Fourier transformation could enhance the model's ability to capture crucial characteristics beyond the time domain. To protect the training quality from anomalies and improve the robustness, FreCT deploys stop-gradient Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence and absolute error to optimize consistency information in both time and frequency domains. Extensive experiments on four public datasets demonstrate that FreCT outperforms existing methods in identifying anomalies.</p></details> |  |
| **[On the emergence of numerical instabilities in Next Generation Reservoir Computing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00846v1)** | 2025-05-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Next Generation Reservoir Computing (NGRC) is a low-cost machine learning method for forecasting chaotic time series from data. However, ensuring the dynamical stability of NGRC models during autonomous prediction remains a challenge. In this work, we uncover a key connection between the numerical conditioning of the NGRC feature matrix -- formed by polynomial evaluations on time-delay coordinates -- and the long-term NGRC dynamics. Merging tools from numerical linear algebra and ergodic theory of dynamical systems, we systematically study how the feature matrix conditioning varies across hyperparameters. We demonstrate that the NGRC feature matrix tends to be ill-conditioned for short time lags and high-degree polynomials. Ill-conditioning amplifies sensitivity to training data perturbations, which can produce unstable NGRC dynamics. We evaluate the impact of different numerical algorithms (Cholesky, SVD, and LU) for solving the regularized least-squares problem.</p></details> | 21 pages, 8 figures |
| **[SMSAT: A Multimodal Acoustic Dataset and Deep Contrastive Learning Framework for Affective and Physiological Modeling of Spiritual Meditation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00839v1)** | 2025-05-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding how auditory stimuli influence emotional and physiological states is fundamental to advancing affective computing and mental health technologies. In this paper, we present a multimodal evaluation of the affective and physiological impacts of three auditory conditions, that is, spiritual meditation (SM), music (M), and natural silence (NS), using a comprehensive suite of biometric signal measures. To facilitate this analysis, we introduce the Spiritual, Music, Silence Acoustic Time Series (SMSAT) dataset, a novel benchmark comprising acoustic time series (ATS) signals recorded under controlled exposure protocols, with careful attention to demographic diversity and experimental consistency. To model the auditory induced states, we develop a contrastive learning based SMSAT audio encoder that extracts highly discriminative embeddings from ATS data, achieving 99.99% classification accuracy in interclass and intraclass evaluations. Furthermore, we propose the Calmness Analysis Model (CAM), a deep learning framework integrating 25 handcrafted and learned features for affective state classification across auditory conditions, attaining robust 99.99% classification accuracy. In contrast, pairwise t tests reveal significant deviations in cardiac response characteristics (CRC) between SM analysis via ANOVA inducing more significant physiological fluctuations. Compared to existing state of the art methods reporting accuracies up to 90%, the proposed model demonstrates substantial performance gains (up to 99%). This work contributes a validated multimodal dataset and a scalable deep learning framework for affective computing applications in stress monitoring, mental well-being, and therapeutic audio-based interventions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-site modelling and reconstruction of past extreme skew surges along the French Atlantic coast](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00835v1)** | 2025-05-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Appropriate modelling of extreme skew surges is crucial, particularly for coastal risk management. Our study focuses on modelling extreme skew surges along the French Atlantic coast, with a particular emphasis on investigating the extremal dependence structure between stations. We employ the peak-over-threshold framework, where a multivariate extreme event is defined whenever at least one location records a large value, though not necessarily all stations simultaneously. A novel method for determining an appropriate level (threshold) above which observations can be classified as extreme is proposed. Two complementary approaches are explored. First, the multivariate generalized Pareto distribution is employed to model extremes, leveraging its properties to derive a generative model that predicts extreme skew surges at one station based on observed extremes at nearby stations. Second, a novel extreme regression framework is assessed for point predictions. This specific regression framework enables accurate point predictions using only the "angle" of input variables, i.e. input variables divided by their norms. The ultimate objective is to reconstruct historical skew surge time series at stations with limited data. This is achieved by integrating extreme skew surge data from stations with longer records, such as Brest and Saint-Nazaire, which provide over 150 years of observations.</p></details> |  |
| **[MIMIC-\RNum{4}-Ext-22MCTS: A 22 Millions-Event Temporal Clinical Time-Series Dataset with Relative Timestamp for Risk Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00827v1)** | 2025-05-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Clinical risk prediction based on machine learning algorithms plays a vital role in modern healthcare. A crucial component in developing a reliable prediction model is collecting high-quality time series clinical events. In this work, we release such a dataset that consists of 22,588,586 Clinical Time Series events, which we term MIMIC-\RNum{4}-Ext-22MCTS. Our source data are discharge summaries selected from the well-known yet unstructured MIMIC-IV-Note \cite{Johnson2023-pg}. We then extract clinical events as short text span from the discharge summaries, along with the timestamps of these events as temporal information. The general-purpose MIMIC-IV-Note pose specific challenges for our work: it turns out that the discharge summaries are too lengthy for typical natural language models to process, and the clinical events of interest often are not accompanied with explicit timestamps. Therefore, we propose a new framework that works as follows: 1) we break each discharge summary into manageably small text chunks; 2) we apply contextual BM25 and contextual semantic search to retrieve chunks that have a high potential of containing clinical events; and 3) we carefully design prompts to teach the recently released Llama-3.1-8B \cite{touvron2023llama} model to identify or infer temporal information of the chunks. We show that the obtained dataset is so informative and transparent that standard models fine-tuned on our dataset are achieving significant improvements in healthcare applications. In particular, the BERT model fine-tuned based on our dataset achieves 10\% improvement in accuracy on medical question answering task, and 3\% improvement in clinical trial matching task compared with the classic BERT. The GPT-2 model, fine-tuned on our dataset, produces more clinically reliable results for clinical questions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unlocking the Potential of Linear Networks for Irregular Multivariate Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00590v1)** | 2025-05-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting holds significant importance across various industries, including finance, transportation, energy, healthcare, and climate. Despite the widespread use of linear networks due to their low computational cost and effectiveness in modeling temporal dependencies, most existing research has concentrated on regularly sampled and fully observed multivariate time series. However, in practice, we frequently encounter irregular multivariate time series characterized by variable sampling intervals and missing values. The inherent intra-series inconsistency and inter-series asynchrony in such data hinder effective modeling and forecasting with traditional linear networks relying on static weights. To tackle these challenges, this paper introduces a novel model named AiT. AiT utilizes an adaptive linear network capable of dynamically adjusting weights according to observation time points to address intra-series inconsistency, thereby enhancing the accuracy of temporal dependencies modeling. Furthermore, by incorporating the Transformer module on variable semantics embeddings, AiT efficiently captures variable correlations, avoiding the challenge of inter-series asynchrony. Comprehensive experiments across four benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of AiT, improving prediction accuracy by 11% and decreasing runtime by 52% compared to existing state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

Recent advances in deep learning have improved EEG classification performance yet model explainability remains an issue. To address this key limitation of explainability we introduce KnowEEG; a novel explainable machine learning approach for EEG classification. KnowEEG extracts a comprehensive set of per-electrode features, filters them using statistical tests, and integrates between-electrode connectivity statistics. These features are then input to our modified Random Forest model (Fusion Forest) that balances per electrode statistics with between electrode connectivity features in growing the trees of the forest. By incorporating knowledge from both the generalized time-series and EEG-specific domains, KnowEEG achieves performance comparable to or exceeding state-of-the-art deep learning models across five different classification tasks: emotion detection, mental workload classification, eyes open/closed detection, abnormal EEG classification, and event detection. In addition to high performance, KnowEEG provides inherent explainability through feature importance scores for understandable features. We demonstrate by example on the eyes closed/open classification task that this explainability can be used to discover knowledge about the classes. This discovered knowledge for eyes open/closed classification was proven to be correct by current neuroscience literature. Therefore, the impact of KnowEEG will be significant for domains where EEG explainability is critical such as healthcare.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Time-Series Data Augmentation Model through Diffusion and Transformer Integration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03790v1)** | 2025-05-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the development of Artificial Intelligence, numerous real-world tasks have been accomplished using technology integrated with deep learning. To achieve optimal performance, deep neural networks typically require large volumes of data for training. Although advances in data augmentation have facilitated the acquisition of vast datasets, most of this data is concentrated in domains like images and speech. However, there has been relatively less focus on augmenting time-series data. To address this gap and generate a substantial amount of time-series data, we propose a simple and effective method that combines the Diffusion and Transformer models. By utilizing an adjusted diffusion denoising model to generate a large volume of initial time-step action data, followed by employing a Transformer model to predict subsequent actions, and incorporating a weighted loss function to achieve convergence, the method demonstrates its effectiveness. Using the performance improvement of the model after applying augmented data as a benchmark, and comparing the results with those obtained without data augmentation or using traditional data augmentation methods, this approach shows its capability to produce high-quality augmented data.</p></details> | 10 pages,22 figures |

However, existing methods face significant challenges due to data distributional shifts across different domains, which are exacerbated by the non-stationarity of time series over time. Existing models fail to generalize under multiple heterogeneous source domains and emerging unseen new target domains. To fill the research gap, we introduce CICADA (Cross-domain Interpretable Coding for Anomaly Detection and Adaptation), with four key innovations: (1) a mixture of experts (MOE) framework that captures domain-agnostic anomaly features with high flexibility and interpretability; (2) a novel selective meta-learning mechanism to prevent negative transfer between dissimilar domains, (3) an adaptive expansion algorithm for emerging heterogeneous domain expansion, and (4) a hierarchical attention structure that quantifies expert contributions during fusion to enhance interpretability further.Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world industrial datasets demonstrate that CICADA outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both cross-domain detection performance and interpretability.</p></details> |  |

After traditional statistical and machine learning approaches, various fundamental deep learning architectures such as MLPs, CNNs, RNNs, and GNNs have been developed. However, the structural limitations caused by the inductive biases of each deep learning architecture constrained their performance. Transformer models, which excel at handling long-term dependencies, have become significant architectural components for time series forecasting. However, recent research has shown that alternatives such as simple linear layers can outperform Transformers. These findings have opened up new possibilities for using diverse architectures, ranging from fundamental deep learning models to emerging architectures and hybrid approaches. In this context, architectural modeling of time series forecasting has now entered a renaissance. This survey not only provides a historical context for time series forecasting but also offers comprehensive and timely analysis of the movement toward architectural diversification. By comparing and re-examining deep learning models, we uncover new perspectives and present recent trends, including hybrid, diffusion, Mamba, and foundation models. By focusing on the inherent characteristics of time series data, we also address open challenges that have gained attention in time series forecasting, such as channel dependency, distribution shift, causality, and feature extraction. These contributions help lower entry barriers for newcomers by providing a systematic understanding of the diverse research areas in time series forecasting (TSF), while offering seasoned researchers broader perspectives and new opportunities through in-depth exploration of TSF challenges.

However, forecasting multivariate time series with Transformer presents a unique challenge as it requires modeling both temporal (cross-time) and variate (cross-variate) dependencies. While Transformer-based models have gained popularity for their flexibility in capturing both sequential and cross-variate relationships, it is unclear how to best integrate these two sources of information in the context of the Transformer architecture while optimizing for both performance and efficiency. We re-purpose the Transformer architecture to effectively model both cross-time and cross-variate dependencies. Our approach begins by embedding each variate independently into a variate-wise representation that captures its cross-time dynamics, and then models cross-variate dependencies through attention mechanisms on these learned embeddings. Gating operations in both cross-time and cross-variate modeling phases regulate information flow, allowing the model to focus on the most relevant features for accurate predictions. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance across 13 real-world datasets and can be seamlessly integrated into other Transformer-based and LLM-based forecasters, delivering performance improvements up to 20.7\% over original models.

| **[Temporal Attention Evolutional Graph Convolutional Network for Multivariate Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00302v1)** | 2025-05-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multivariate time series forecasting enables the prediction of future states by leveraging historical data, thereby facilitating decision-making processes. Each data node in a multivariate time series encompasses a sequence of multiple dimensions. These nodes exhibit interdependent relationships, forming a graph structure. While existing prediction methods often assume a fixed graph structure, many real-world scenarios involve dynamic graph structures. Moreover, interactions among time series observed at different time scales vary significantly. To enhance prediction accuracy by capturing precise temporal and spatial features, this paper introduces the Temporal Attention Evolutional Graph Convolutional Network (TAEGCN). This novel method not only integrates causal temporal convolution and a multi-head self-attention mechanism to learn temporal features of nodes, but also construct the dynamic graph structure based on these temporal features to keep the consistency of the changing in spatial feature with temporal series. TAEGCN adeptly captures temporal causal relationships and hidden spatial dependencies within the data. Furthermore, TAEGCN incorporates a unified neural network that seamlessly integrates these components to generate final predictions. Experimental results conducted on two public transportation network datasets, METR-LA and PEMS-BAY, demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed model.</p></details> | 13 pages, 7 figures |

Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has provided static snapshots of gene expression, offering valuable insights into cellular states at a single time point. Recent advancements in temporally resolved scRNA-seq, spatial transcriptomics (ST), and time-series spatial transcriptomics (temporal-ST) have further revolutionized our ability to study the spatiotemporal dynamics of individual cells. These technologies, when combined with computational frameworks such as Markov chains, stochastic differential equations (SDEs), and generative models like optimal transport and Schr\"odinger bridges, enable the reconstruction of dynamic cellular trajectories and cell fate decisions. This review discusses how these dynamical system approaches offer new opportunities to model and infer cellular dynamics from a systematic perspective.</p></details> |  |

It is important to discover temporal patterns from such data and to forecast future activities accurately. However, modeling and forecasting social activity data streams is difficult because they are high-dimensional and composed of multiple time-varying dynamics such as trends, seasonality, and interest diffusion. In this paper, we propose D-Tracker, a method for continuously capturing time-varying temporal patterns within social activity tensor data streams and forecasting future activities. Our proposed method has the following properties: (a) Interpretable: it incorporates the partial differential equation into a tensor decomposition framework and captures time-varying temporal patterns such as trends, seasonality, and interest diffusion between locations in an interpretable manner; (b) Automatic: it has no hyperparameters and continuously models tensor data streams fully automatically; (c) Scalable: the computation time of D-Tracker is independent of the time series length. Experiments using web search volume data obtained from GoogleTrends, and COVID-19 infection data obtained from COVID-19 Open Data Repository show that our method can achieve higher forecasting accuracy in less computation time than existing methods while extracting the interest diffusion between locations.

This black-box access is especially limiting when constructing mixture-of-expert type ensemble models since the user cannot optimize each proprietary AI's internal parameters. Our problem naturally lends itself to a non-competitive game-theoretic lens where each proprietary AI (agent) is inherently competing against the other AI agents, with this competition arising naturally due to their obliviousness of the AI's to their internal structure. In contrast, the user acts as a central planner trying to synchronize the ensemble of competing AIs. We show the existence of the unique Nash equilibrium in the online setting, which we even compute in closed-form by eliciting a feedback mechanism between any given time series and the sequence generated by each (proprietary) AI agent. Our solution is implemented as a decentralized, federated-learning algorithm in which each agent optimizes their structure locally on their machine without ever releasing any internal structure to the others. We obtain refined expressions for pre-trained models such as transformers, random feature models, and echo-state networks. Our ``proprietary federated learning'' algorithm is implemented on a range of real-world and synthetic time-series benchmarks. It achieves orders-of-magnitude improvements in predictive accuracy over natural benchmarks, of which there are surprisingly few due to this natural problem still being largely unexplored.</p></details> | <details><summary>47 pa...</summary><p>47 pages, 16 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |

Current methods for measuring insulin resistance, while effective, are expensive, inaccessible, not widely available and hinder opportunities for early intervention. In this study, we remotely recruited the largest dataset to date across the US to study insulin resistance (N=1,165 participants, with median BMI=28 kg/m2, age=45 years, HbA1c=5.4%), incorporating wearable device time series data and blood biomarkers, including the ground-truth measure of insulin resistance, homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR). We developed deep neural network models to predict insulin resistance based on readily available digital and blood biomarkers. Our results show that our models can predict insulin resistance by combining both wearable data and readily available blood biomarkers better than either of the two data sources separately (R2=0.5, auROC=0.80, Sensitivity=76%, and specificity 84%). The model showed 93% sensitivity and 95% adjusted specificity in obese and sedentary participants, a subpopulation most vulnerable to developing type 2 diabetes and who could benefit most from early intervention. Rigorous evaluation of model performance, including interpretability, and robustness, facilitates generalizability across larger cohorts, which is demonstrated by reproducing the prediction performance on an independent validation cohort (N=72 participants). Additionally, we demonstrated how the predicted insulin resistance can be integrated into a large language model agent to help understand and contextualize HOMA-IR values, facilitating interpretation and safe personalized recommendations. This work offers the potential for early detection of people at risk of type 2 diabetes and thereby facilitate earlier implementation of preventative strategies.</p></details> |  |

While the standard toolkit for multivariate time series analysis has many advantages, it can be difficult to capture nonlinear dynamics using linear vector autoregressive models. This difficulty has motivated the development of methods for variable selection, causal discovery, and graphical modeling for nonlinear time series, which routinely employ nonparametric tests for conditional independence. In this paper, we introduce the first framework for conditional independence testing that works with a single realization of a nonstationary nonlinear process. The key technical ingredients are time-varying nonlinear regression, time-varying covariance estimation, and a distribution-uniform strong Gaussian approximation.</p></details> |  |

By applying natural language processing and machine learning techniques, we examine how sentiment patterns in fashion-related social media conversations can serve as predictors for emerging fashion trends. Our analysis involves the identification and categorization of fashion-related content, sentiment classification with improved normalization techniques, time series decomposition, statistically validated causal relationship modeling, cross-platform sentiment comparison, and brand-specific sentiment analysis. Results indicate correlations between sentiment patterns and fashion theme popularity, with accessories and streetwear themes showing statistically significant rising trends. The Granger causality analysis establishes sustainability and streetwear as primary trend drivers, showing bidirectional relationships with several other themes. The findings demonstrate that social media sentiment analysis can serve as an effective early indicator of fashion trend trajectories when proper statistical validation is applied. Our improved predictive model achieved 78.35% balanced accuracy in sentiment classification, establishing a reliable foundation for trend prediction across positive, neutral, and negative sentiment categories.</p></details> | 13 pages |

Traditional heuristics based on handcrafted rules often lack accuracy, while recently proposed deep learning approaches suffer from computational cost, lack of explainability, and generalization issues that limit their practical adoption. In this paper, we introduce TrajEvo, a framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to automatically design trajectory prediction heuristics. TrajEvo employs an evolutionary algorithm to generate and refine prediction heuristics from past trajectory data. We introduce a Cross-Generation Elite Sampling to promote population diversity and a Statistics Feedback Loop allowing the LLM to analyze alternative predictions. Our evaluations show TrajEvo outperforms previous heuristic methods on the ETH-UCY datasets, and remarkably outperforms both heuristics and deep learning methods when generalizing to the unseen SDD dataset. TrajEvo represents a first step toward automated design of fast, explainable, and generalizable trajectory prediction heuristics. We make our source code publicly available to foster future research at https://github.com/ai4co/trajevo.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trajectory Entropy Reinforcement Learning for Predictable and Robust Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04193v1)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Simplicity is a critical inductive bias for designing data-driven controllers, especially when robustness is important. Despite the impressive results of deep reinforcement learning in complex control tasks, it is prone to capturing intricate and spurious correlations between observations and actions, leading to failure under slight perturbations to the environment. To tackle this problem, in this work we introduce a novel inductive bias towards simple policies in reinforcement learning. The simplicity inductive bias is introduced by minimizing the entropy of entire action trajectories, corresponding to the number of bits required to describe information in action trajectories after the agent observes state trajectories. Our reinforcement learning agent, Trajectory Entropy Reinforcement Learning, is optimized to minimize the trajectory entropy while maximizing rewards. We show that the trajectory entropy can be effectively estimated by learning a variational parameterized action prediction model, and use the prediction model to construct an information-regularized reward function. Furthermore, we construct a practical algorithm that enables the joint optimization of models, including the policy and the prediction model. Experimental evaluations on several high-dimensional locomotion tasks show that our learned policies produce more cyclical and consistent action trajectories, and achieve superior performance, and robustness to noise and dynamic changes than the state-of-the-art.</p></details> | 10 pages |
| **[DyTTP: Trajectory Prediction with Normalization-Free Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05356v2)** | 2025-05-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate trajectory prediction is a cornerstone for the safe operation of autonomous driving systems, where understanding the dynamic behavior of surrounding agents is crucial. Transformer-based architectures have demonstrated significant promise in capturing complex spatio-temporality dependencies. However, their reliance on normalization layers can lead to computation overhead and training instabilities. In this work, we present a two-fold approach to address these challenges. First, we integrate DynamicTanh (DyT), which is the latest method to promote transformers, into the backbone, replacing traditional layer normalization. This modification simplifies the network architecture and improves the stability of the inference. We are the first work to deploy the DyT to the trajectory prediction task. Complementing this, we employ a snapshot ensemble strategy to further boost trajectory prediction performance. Using cyclical learning rate scheduling, multiple model snapshots are captured during a single training run. These snapshots are then aggregated via simple averaging at inference time, allowing the model to benefit from diverse hypotheses without incurring substantial additional computational cost. Extensive experiments on Argoverse datasets demonstrate that our combined approach significantly improves prediction accuracy, inference speed and robustness in diverse driving scenarios. This work underscores the potential of normalization-free transformer designs augmented with lightweight ensemble techniques in advancing trajectory forecasting for autonomous vehicles.</p></details> |  |

However, understanding the evolution of user preferences remains a complex challenge, particularly as their musical tastes change over time. This paper uses the dictionary learning paradigm to model user trajectories across different musical genres. We define a new framework that captures recurring patterns in genre trajectories, called pathlets, enabling the creation of comprehensible trajectory embeddings. We show that pathlet learning reveals relevant listening patterns that can be analyzed both qualitatively and quantitatively. This work improves our understanding of users' interactions with music and opens up avenues of research into user behavior and fostering diversity in recommender systems.

The formulation extends the prize-collecting traveling salesman problem. A tailored genetic algorithm evolves candidate solutions using a fitness function, crossover, and mutation, with constraint enforcement via a penalty method. Differential flatness and clothoid curves are employed to penalize infeasible trajectories efficiently, while the Euler spiral method ensures curvature-continuous trajectories with bounded curvature, enhancing dynamic feasibility and mitigating oscillations typical of minimum-jerk and snap parameterizations. Due to the discrete variable length optimization space, crossover is performed using a dynamic time-warping-based method and extended convex combination with projection. The algorithm's performance is validated through simulations and experiments with a ground vehicle, quadrotor, and quadruped, supported by benchmarking and time-complexity analysis.</p></details> |  |

While diffusion models have shown promise in planning, they are limited to solving tasks similar to those seen in their training data. We propose CompDiffuser, a novel generative approach that can solve new tasks by learning to compositionally stitch together shorter trajectory chunks from previously seen tasks. Our key insight is modeling the trajectory distribution by subdividing it into overlapping chunks and learning their conditional relationships through a single bidirectional diffusion model. This allows information to propagate between segments during generation, ensuring physically consistent connections. We conduct experiments on benchmark tasks of various difficulties, covering different environment sizes, agent state dimension, trajectory types, training data quality, and show that CompDiffuser significantly outperforms existing methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://comp-diffuser.github.io/</p></details> |

| **[Riemannian Direct Trajectory Optimization of Rigid Bodies on Matrix Lie Groups](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02323v1)** | 2025-05-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Designing dynamically feasible trajectories for rigid bodies is a fundamental problem in robotics. Although direct trajectory optimization is widely applied to solve this problem, inappropriate parameterizations of rigid body dynamics often result in slow convergence and violations of the intrinsic topological structure of the rotation group. This paper introduces a Riemannian optimization framework for direct trajectory optimization of rigid bodies. We first use the Lie Group Variational Integrator to formulate the discrete rigid body dynamics on matrix Lie groups. We then derive the closed-form first- and second-order Riemannian derivatives of the dynamics. Finally, this work applies a line-search Riemannian Interior Point Method (RIPM) to perform trajectory optimization with general nonlinear constraints. As the optimization is performed on matrix Lie groups, it is correct-by-construction to respect the topological structure of the rotation group and be free of singularities. The paper demonstrates that both the derivative evaluations and Newton steps required to solve the RIPM exhibit linear complexity with respect to the planning horizon and system degrees of freedom. Simulation results illustrate that the proposed method is faster than conventional methods by an order of magnitude in challenging robotics tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to Robotics: Science and Systems (RSS) 2025</p></details> |

To tackle the intrinsic sparsity issue of real-world user mobility traces, spatiotemporal contexts have been shown as significantly useful. Existing solutions mostly incorporate spatiotemporal distances between locations in mobility traces, either by feeding them as additional inputs to Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) or by using them to search for informative past hidden states for prediction. However, such distance-based methods fail to capture the time-varying temporal regularities of human mobility, where human mobility is often more regular in the morning than in other periods, for example; this suggests the usefulness of the actual timestamps besides the temporal distances. Against this background, we propose REPLAY, a general RNN architecture learning to capture the time-varying temporal regularities for location prediction. Specifically, REPLAY not only resorts to the spatiotemporal distances in sparse trajectories to search for the informative past hidden states, but also accommodates the time-varying temporal regularities by incorporating smoothed timestamp embeddings using Gaussian weighted averaging with timestamp-specific learnable bandwidths, which can flexibly adapt to the temporal regularities of different strengths across different timestamps. Our extensive evaluation compares REPLAY against a sizable collection of state-of-the-art techniques on two real-world datasets. Results show that REPLAY consistently and significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 7.7\%-10.5\% in the location prediction task, and the bandwidths reveal interesting patterns of the time-varying temporal regularities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing</p></details> |

Traditional modular methods suffer from error propagation, while existing end-to-end models typically employ static one-shot inference paradigms that inadequately capture the dynamic changes of the environment. ARTEMIS takes a different method by generating trajectory waypoints sequentially, preserves critical temporal dependencies while dynamically routing scene-specific queries to specialized expert networks. It effectively relieves trajectory quality degradation issues encountered when guidance information is ambiguous, and overcomes the inherent representational limitations of singular network architectures when processing diverse driving scenarios. Additionally, we use a lightweight batch reallocation strategy that significantly improves the training speed of the Mixture-of-Experts model. Through experiments on the NAVSIM dataset, ARTEMIS exhibits superior competitive performance, achieving 87.0 PDMS and 83.1 EPDMS with ResNet-34 backbone, demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on multiple metrics.</p></details> |  |

Directly mapping camera data to actions via neural networks can result in jerky motions and difficulties in meeting critical constraints, compromising safety and robustness in real-world deployment. For tasks that require high robustness or strict adherence to constraints, ensuring trajectory quality is crucial. However, the lack of interpretability in neural networks makes it challenging to generate constraint-compliant actions in a controlled manner. This paper introduces differentiable policy trajectory optimization with generalizability (DiffOG), a learning-based trajectory optimization framework designed to enhance visuomotor policies. By leveraging the proposed differentiable formulation of trajectory optimization with transformer, DiffOG seamlessly integrates policies with a generalizable optimization layer. Visuomotor policies enhanced by DiffOG generate smoother, constraint-compliant action trajectories in a more interpretable way. DiffOG exhibits strong generalization capabilities and high flexibility. We evaluated DiffOG across 11 simulated tasks and 2 real-world tasks. The results demonstrate that DiffOG significantly enhances the trajectory quality of visuomotor policies while having minimal impact on policy performance, outperforming trajectory processing baselines such as greedy constraint clipping and penalty-based trajectory optimization. Furthermore, DiffOG achieves superior performance compared to existing constrained visuomotor policy.</p></details> |  |

In particular, reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promise in the synthesis of controllers for systems with complex dynamics and modest online compute budgets. However, the poor sample efficiency of RL and the challenges of reward design make training slow and sometimes unstable, especially for high-dimensional systems. In this work, we leverage the inherent Lie group symmetries of robotic systems with a floating base to mitigate these challenges when learning tracking controllers. We model a general tracking problem as a Markov decision process (MDP) that captures the evolution of both the physical and reference states. Next, we prove that symmetry in the underlying dynamics and running costs leads to an MDP homomorphism, a mapping that allows a policy trained on a lower-dimensional "quotient" MDP to be lifted to an optimal tracking controller for the original system. We compare this symmetry-informed approach to an unstructured baseline, using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to learn tracking controllers for three systems: the Particle (a forced point mass), the Astrobee (a fullyactuated space robot), and the Quadrotor (an underactuated system). Results show that a symmetry-aware approach both accelerates training and reduces tracking error at convergence.</p></details> | <details><summary>The f...</summary><p>The first three authors contributed equally to this work.

The challenge is to compute near-optimal sensor placements for detecting targets whose trajectories follow a log-Gaussian Cox line process. We explore sensor deployment in a transformed space, where linear target trajectories are represented as points. While this space simplifies handling the line process, the spatial functions representing sensor performance (i.e. probability of detection) become less intuitive. To illustrate our approach, we focus on positioning sensors of the barrier coverage system on the seafloor to detect passing ships. Through numerical experiments using historical ship data, we compute sensor locations that maximize the probability all ship passing over the barrier coverage system are detected.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work is published in IEEE SysCon 2025</p></details> |

This study addresses the challenges of video-based vessel tracking and prediction by integrating advanced object detection methods, Kalman filters, and spline-based interpolation. However, existing detection systems often misclassify objects in inland waterways due to complex surroundings. A comparative evaluation of tracking algorithms, including BoT-SORT, Deep OC-SORT, and ByeTrack, highlights the robustness of the Kalman filter in providing smoothed trajectories. Experimental results from diverse scenarios demonstrate improved accuracy in predicting vessel movements, which is essential for collision avoidance and situational awareness. The findings underline the necessity of customized datasets and models for inland navigation. Future work will expand the datasets and incorporate vessel classification to refine predictions, supporting both autonomous systems and human operators in complex environments.</p></details> |  |

Despite its significance, research in this domain remains relatively limited, with most existing studies concentrating on single-modal trajectory prediction of vehicles. In this work, we propose ParkDiffusion, a novel approach that predicts the trajectories of both vehicles and pedestrians in automated parking scenarios. ParkDiffusion employs diffusion models to capture the inherent uncertainty and multi-modality of future trajectories, incorporating several key innovations. First, we propose a dual map encoder that processes soft semantic cues and hard geometric constraints using a two-step cross-attention mechanism. Second, we introduce an adaptive agent type embedding module, which dynamically conditions the prediction process on the distinct characteristics of vehicles and pedestrians. Third, to ensure kinematic feasibility, our model outputs control signals that are subsequently used within a kinematic framework to generate physically feasible trajectories. We evaluate ParkDiffusion on the Dragon Lake Parking (DLP) dataset and the Intersections Drone (inD) dataset. Our work establishes a new baseline for heterogeneous trajectory prediction in parking scenarios, outperforming existing methods by a considerable margin.</p></details> |  |

State-of-the-art motion forecasting models rely on large curated datasets with manually annotated or heavily post-processed trajectories. However, building these datasets is costly, generally manual, hard to scale, and lacks reproducibility. They also introduce domain gaps that limit generalization across environments. We introduce PPT (Pretraining with Pseudo-labeled Trajectories), a simple and scalable alternative that uses unprocessed and diverse trajectories automatically generated from off-the-shelf 3D detectors and tracking. Unlike traditional pipelines aiming for clean, single-label annotations, PPT embraces noise and diversity as useful signals for learning robust representations. With optional finetuning on a small amount of labeled data, models pretrained with PPT achieve strong performance across standard benchmarks particularly in low-data regimes, and in cross-domain, end-to-end and multi-class settings. PPT is easy to implement and improves generalization in motion forecasting.

This paper presents whole-trajectory clustering and sub-trajectory clustering algorithms based on DBSCAN line segment clustering, which encompasses two key events: split and merge of line segments. The events are employed by object movement history and the average Euclidean distance between line segments. In this framework, whole-trajectory clustering considers entire entities' trajectories, whereas sub-trajectory clustering employs a sliding window model to identify similar sub-trajectories. Many existing trajectory clustering algorithms respond to temporary anomalies in data by splitting trajectories, which often obscures otherwise consistent clustering patterns and leads to less reliable insights. We introduce the stable trajectory clustering algorithm, which leverages the mean absolute deviation concept to demonstrate that selective omission of transient deviations not only preserves the integrity of clusters but also improves their stability and interpretability. We run all proposed algorithms on real trajectory datasets to illustrate their effectiveness and sensitivity to parameter variations.</p></details> |  |

Despite their utility in advancing digital automation, a critical bottleneck persists: collecting high-quality trajectory data for training. Common practices for collecting such data rely on human supervision or synthetic data generation through executing pre-defined tasks, which are either resource-intensive or unable to guarantee data quality. Moreover, these methods suffer from limited data diversity and significant gaps between synthetic data and real-world environments. To address these challenges, we propose OS-Genesis, a novel GUI data synthesis pipeline that reverses the conventional trajectory collection process. Instead of relying on pre-defined tasks, OS-Genesis enables agents first to perceive environments and perform step-wise interactions, then retrospectively derive high-quality tasks to enable trajectory-level exploration. A trajectory reward model is then employed to ensure the quality of the generated trajectories. We demonstrate that training GUI agents with OS-Genesis significantly improves their performance on highly challenging online benchmarks. In-depth analysis further validates OS-Genesis's efficiency and its superior data quality and diversity compared to existing synthesis methods. Our codes, data, and checkpoints are available at https://qiushisun.github.io/OS-Genesis-Home/.</p></details> | Work in progress |

In this setup, measurement (output) uncertainties are state-dependent and set-valued. Enveloping ellipsoids are employed to characterize state-dependent uncertainties with unknown distributions. The concept of regularity for set-valued output maps is then introduced, facilitating the formulation of the estimation-aware trajectory generation problem. Specifically, it is demonstrated that for output-regular maps, one can utilize a set-valued observability measure that is concave with respect to the finite horizon state trajectories. By maximizing this measure, estimation-aware trajectories can then be synthesized for a broad class of systems. Trajectory planning routines are also examined in this work, by which the observability measure is optimized for systems with locally linearized dynamics. To illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, representative examples in the context of trajectory planning with vision-based estimation are presented. Moreover, the paper presents estimation-aware planning for an uncooperative Target-Rendezvous problem, where an Ego-satellite employs an onboard machine learning (ML)-based estimation module to realize the rendezvous trajectory.</p></details> | 40 pages, 9 figures |

Specifically, we use the Fr\'{e}chet mean, and metrics based on the optimal sub-pattern assignment (OSPA) construct, to extend the notion of average from vectors to trajectories and multi-object trajectories. Further, we develop efficient algorithms to compute these means using greedy search and Gibbs sampling. Using distributed multi-object tracking as an application, we demonstrate that the Fr\'{e}chet mean approach to multi-object trajectory consensus significantly outperforms state-of-the-art distributed multi-object tracking methods.</p></details> |  |

However, maintaining tracking continuity and consistency remains a significant challenge. Traditional detection-assignment tracking methods struggle with false positives, false negatives, and frequent identity switches, leading to degraded counting accuracy and making in-depth analysis impossible. This paper introduces a point-oriented online tracking algorithm that improves trajectory continuity and counting reliability in drone-based crowd monitoring. Our method builds on the Simple Online and Real-time Tracking (SORT) framework, replacing the original bounding-box assignment with a point-distance metric. The algorithm is enhanced with three cost-effective techniques: camera motion compensation, altitude-aware assignment, and classification-based trajectory validation. Further, Deep Discriminative Correlation Filters (DDCF) that re-use spatial feature maps from localisation algorithms for increased computational efficiency through neural network resource sharing are integrated to refine object tracking by reducing noise and handling missed detections. The proposed method is evaluated on the DroneCrowd and newly shared UP-COUNT-TRACK datasets, demonstrating substantial improvements in tracking metrics, reducing counting errors to 23% and 15%, respectively. The results also indicate a significant reduction of identity switches while maintaining high tracking accuracy, outperforming baseline online trackers and even an offline greedy optimisation method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint submitted to the Expert Systems with Applications journal</p></details> |
| **[Kinodynamic Trajectory Following with STELA: Simultaneous Trajectory Estimation & Local Adaptation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20009v1)** | 2025-04-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>State estimation and control are often addressed separately, leading to unsafe execution due to sensing noise, execution errors, and discrepancies between the planning model and reality. Simultaneous control and trajectory estimation using probabilistic graphical models has been proposed as a unified solution to these challenges. Previous work, however, relies heavily on appropriate Gaussian priors and is limited to holonomic robots with linear time-varying models. The current research extends graphical optimization methods to vehicles with arbitrary dynamical models via Simultaneous Trajectory Estimation and Local Adaptation (STELA). The overall approach initializes feasible trajectories using a kinodynamic, sampling-based motion planner. Then, it simultaneously: (i) estimates the past trajectory based on noisy observations, and (ii) adapts the controls to be executed to minimize deviations from the planned, feasible trajectory, while avoiding collisions. The proposed factor graph representation of trajectories in STELA can be applied for any dynamical system given access to first or second-order state update equations, and introduces the duration of execution between two states in the trajectory discretization as an optimization variable. These features provide both generalization and flexibility in trajectory following. In addition to targeting computational efficiency, the proposed strategy performs incremental updates of the factor graph using the iSAM algorithm and introduces a time-window mechanism. This mechanism allows the factor graph to be dynamically updated to operate over a limited history and forward horizon of the planned trajectory. This enables online updates of controls at a minimum of 10Hz. Experiments demonstrate that STELA achieves at least comparable performance to previous frameworks on idealized vehicles with linear dynamics.[...]</p></details> | [Accepted] RSS 2025 |

While, the spin is not directly observable in standard broadcasting videos, we show that it can be inferred from the ball's trajectory in the video. We present a novel method to infer the initial spin and 3D trajectory from the corresponding 2D trajectory in a video. Without ground truth labels for broadcast videos, we train a neural network solely on synthetic data. Due to the choice of our input data representation, physically correct synthetic training data, and using targeted augmentations, the network naturally generalizes to real data. Notably, these simple techniques are sufficient to achieve generalization. No real data at all is required for training. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to present a method for spin and trajectory prediction in simple monocular broadcast videos, achieving an accuracy of 92.0% in spin classification and a 2D reprojection error of 0.19% of the image diagonal.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be published in 2025 IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshops (CVPRW)</p></details> |

However, existing methods face robotic hardware dependency and control frequency mismatches between teleoperation devices and robotic platforms. Our approach automatically extracts kinematic parameters from unified robot description format (URDF) files, and enables pluggable deployment across diverse robots through uniform interfaces. The proposed interpolation algorithm bridges the frequency gap between low-rate human inputs and high-frequency robotic control commands through online continuous trajectory generation, \n{while requiring no access to the closed, bottom-level control loop}. To enhance trajectory smoothness, we introduce a minimum-stretch spline that optimizes the motion quality. The system further provides precision and rapid modes to accommodate different task requirements. Experiments across various robotic platforms including dual-arm ones demonstrate generality and smooth operation performance of our methods.

Existing deep generative models learn from real trajectories to generate synthetic ones. Despite the progress, most of them suffer from training stability issues and scale poorly with increasing data size. More importantly, they often lack control mechanisms to guide the generated trajectories under constraints such as enforcing specific visits. To address these limitations, we formally define the controlled trajectory generation problem for effectively handling multiple spatiotemporal constraints. We introduce Geo-Llama, a novel LLM finetuning framework that can enforce multiple explicit visit constraints while maintaining contextual coherence of the generated trajectories. In this approach, pre-trained LLMs are fine-tuned on trajectory data with a visit-wise permutation strategy where each visit corresponds to a specific time and location. This strategy enables the model to capture spatiotemporal patterns regardless of visit orders while maintaining flexible and in-context constraint integration through prompts during generation. Extensive experiments on real-world and synthetic datasets validate the effectiveness of Geo-Llama, demonstrating its versatility and robustness in handling a broad range of constraints to generate more realistic trajectories compared to existing methods.</p></details> |  |

To tackle this, an end-to-end foot trajectory and force optimization framework (FTFOF) is proposed, which optimizes foot adhesion and detachment forces through trajectory adjustments. This framework accepts general foot trajectory constraints and user-defined parameters as input, ultimately producing an optimal single foot trajectory. It integrates three-segment $C^2$ continuous Bezier curves, tailored to various foot structures, enabling the generation of effective climbing trajectories. A dilate-based GRU predictive model establishes the relationship between foot trajectories and the corresponding foot forces. Multi-objective optimization algorithms, combined with a redundancy hierarchical strategy, identify the most suitable foot trajectory for specific tasks, thereby ensuring optimal performance across detachment force, adhesion force and vibration amplitude. Experimental validation on the quadruped climbing robot MST-M3F showed that, compared to commonly used trajectories in existing legged climbing robots, the proposed framework achieved reductions in maximum detachment force by 28 \%, vibration amplitude by 82 \%, which ensures the stable climbing of dry adhesion legged climbing robots.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trajectory Planning with Model Predictive Control for Obstacle Avoidance Considering Prediction Uncertainty](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19193v1)** | 2025-04-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces a novel trajectory planner for autonomous robots, specifically designed to enhance navigation by incorporating dynamic obstacle avoidance within the Robot Operating System 2 (ROS2) and Navigation 2 (Nav2) framework. The proposed method utilizes Model Predictive Control (MPC) with a focus on handling the uncertainties associated with the movement prediction of dynamic obstacles. Unlike existing Nav2 trajectory planners which primarily deal with static obstacles or react to the current position of dynamic obstacles, this planner predicts future obstacle positions using a stochastic Vector Auto-Regressive Model (VAR). The obstacles' future positions are represented by probability distributions, and collision avoidance is achieved through constraints based on the Mahalanobis distance, ensuring the robot avoids regions where obstacles are likely to be. This approach considers the robot's kinodynamic constraints, enabling it to track a reference path while adapting to real-time changes in the environment. The paper details the implementation, including obstacle prediction, tracking, and the construction of feasible sets for MPC. Simulation results in a Gazebo environment demonstrate the effectiveness of this method in scenarios where robots must navigate around each other, showing improved collision avoidance capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been accepted to IFAC for publication under a Creative Commons Licence CC-BY-NC-ND</p></details> |

Therefore, fin-driven autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) can achieve high maneuverability with a smaller number of actuators, but their control is challenging. This study proposes an analytic control allocation method for underactuated Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs). By integrating an adaptive hybrid feedback controller, we enable an AUV with 4 actuators to move in 6 degrees of freedom (DOF) in simulation and up to 5-DOF in real-world experiments. The proposed method outperformed state-of-the-art control allocation techniques in 6-DOF trajectory tracking simulations, exhibiting centimeter-scale accuracy and higher energy and computational efficiency. Real-world pool experiments confirmed the method's robustness and efficacy in tracking complex 3D trajectories, with significant computational efficiency gains 0.007 (ms) vs. 22.28 (ms). Our method offers a balance between performance, energy efficiency, and computational efficiency, showcasing a potential avenue for more effective tracking of a large number of DOF for under-actuated underwater robots.</p></details> |  |

These seek to answer a fundamental question: What can we learn from time series measurements of a complex dynamical system? For small systems interacting with external environments, the effective dynamics are inherently stochastic, making it crucial to properly manage noise in data. Here, we explore this for systems obeying Langevin dynamics and, using currents, we construct a learning framework for stochastic modeling. Currents have recently gained increased attention for their role in bounding entropy production (EP) from thermodynamic uncertainty relations (TURs). We introduce a fundamental relationship between the cumulant currents there and standard machine-learning loss functions. Using this, we derive loss functions for several key thermodynamic functions directly from the system dynamics without the (common) intermediate step of deriving a TUR. These loss functions reproduce results derived both from TURs and other methods. More significantly, they open a path to discover new loss functions for previously inaccessible quantities. Notably, this includes access to per-trajectory entropy production, even if the observed system is driven far from its steady-state. We also consider higher order estimation. Our method is straightforward and unifies dynamic inference with recent approaches to entropy production estimation. Taken altogether, this reveals a deep connection between diffusion models in machine learning and entropy production estimation in stochastic thermodynamics.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 6 appendices (10 pages), 4 figures; https://csc.ucdavis.edu/~cmg/compmech/pubs/currents.htm</p></details> |
| **[DDAT: Diffusion Policies Enforcing Dynamically Admissible Robot Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15043v2)** | 2025-04-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models excel at creating images and videos thanks to their multimodal generative capabilities. These same capabilities have made diffusion models increasingly popular in robotics research, where they are used for generating robot motion. However, the stochastic nature of diffusion models is fundamentally at odds with the precise dynamical equations describing the feasible motion of robots. Hence, generating dynamically admissible robot trajectories is a challenge for diffusion models. To alleviate this issue, we introduce DDAT: Diffusion policies for Dynamically Admissible Trajectories to generate provably admissible trajectories of black-box robotic systems using diffusion models. A sequence of states is a dynamically admissible trajectory if each state of the sequence belongs to the reachable set of its predecessor by the robot's equations of motion. To generate such trajectories, our diffusion policies project their predictions onto a dynamically admissible manifold during both training and inference to align the objective of the denoiser neural network with the dynamical admissibility constraint. The auto-regressive nature of these projections along with the black-box nature of robot dynamics render these projections immensely challenging. We thus enforce admissibility by iteratively sampling a polytopic under-approximation of the reachable set of a state onto which we project its predicted successor, before iterating this process with the projected successor. By producing accurate trajectories, this projection eliminates the need for diffusion models to continually replan, enabling one-shot long-horizon trajectory planning. We demonstrate that our framework generates higher quality dynamically admissible robot trajectories through extensive simulations on a quadcopter and various MuJoCo environments, along with real-world experiments on a Unitree GO1 and GO2.</p></details> |  |

Critical to these improvements is understanding AVs' longitudinal behavior, relying heavily on real-world trajectory data. Existing open-source trajectory datasets of AV, however, often fall short in refinement, reliability, and completeness, hindering effective performance metrics analysis and model development. This study addresses these challenges by creating a Unified Longitudinal TRAjectory dataset for AVs (Ultra-AV) to analyze their microscopic longitudinal driving behaviors. This dataset compiles data from 13 distinct sources, encompassing various AV types, test sites, and experiment scenarios. We established a three-step data processing: 1. extraction of longitudinal trajectory data, 2. general data cleaning, and 3. data-specific cleaning to obtain the longitudinal trajectory data and car-following trajectory data. The validity of the processed data is affirmed through performance evaluations across safety, mobility, stability, and sustainability, along with an analysis of the relationships between variables in car-following models. Our work not only furnishes researchers with standardized data and metrics for longitudinal AV behavior studies but also sets guidelines for data collection and model development.</p></details> | NA |

While these methods achieve exceptional performance in defined datasets, they usually rely on the independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) assumption and thus tend to be vulnerable to distribution shifts that occur in the real world. In addition, these methods lack explainability due to their black box nature, which poses further challenges in terms of the approval process and social trustworthiness. Therefore, in order to use the capabilities of data-driven statistical AI methods in a reliable and trustworthy manner, the concept of TrustMHE is introduced and investigated in this paper. TrustMHE represents a complementary approach, independent of the underlying AI systems, that combines AI-driven out-of-distribution detection with control-driven moving horizon estimation (MHE) to enable not only detection and monitoring, but also intervention. The effectiveness of the proposed TrustMHE is evaluated and proven in three simulation scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to be published as part of the 2025 IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV), JCluj-Napoca, Romania, June 22-25, 2025</p></details> |

While many data-driven approaches aim to learn system dynamics, jointly predicting internal loads and system trajectories remains a key challenge. This dual prediction is especially important for fault detection and predictive maintenance, where internal loads-such as contact forces-act as early indicators of faults, reflecting wear or misalignment before affecting motion. These forces also serve as inputs to degradation models (e.g., crack growth), enabling damage prediction and remaining useful life estimation. We propose Equi-Euler GraphNet, a physics-informed graph neural network (GNN) that simultaneously predicts internal forces and global trajectories in multi-body systems. In this mesh-free framework, nodes represent system components and edges encode interactions. Equi-Euler GraphNet introduces two inductive biases: (1) an equivariant message-passing scheme, interpreting edge messages as interaction forces consistent under Euclidean transformations; and (2) a temporal-aware iterative node update mechanism, based on Euler integration, to capture influence of distant interactions over time. Tailored for cylindrical roller bearings, it decouples ring dynamics from constrained motion of rolling elements. Trained on high-fidelity multiphysics simulations, Equi-Euler GraphNet generalizes beyond the training distribution, accurately predicting loads and trajectories under unseen speeds, loads, and configurations. It outperforms state-of-the-art GNNs focused on trajectory prediction, delivering stable rollouts over thousands of time steps with minimal error accumulation. Achieving up to a 200x speedup over conventional solvers while maintaining comparable accuracy, it serves as an efficient reduced-order model for digital twins, design, and maintenance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Reupl...</summary><p>Reuploaded with new version-- equation 16 was incorrect</p></details> |

However, due to localization errors/uncertainties, trajectory deconfliction can fail even if trajectories are perfectly shared between agents. To address this issue, we first present PARM and PARM*, perception-aware, decentralized, asynchronous multiagent trajectory planners that enable a team of agents to navigate uncertain environments while deconflicting trajectories and avoiding obstacles using perception information. PARM* differs from PARM as it is less conservative, using more computation to find closer-to-optimal solutions. While these methods achieve state-of-the-art performance, they suffer from high computational costs as they need to solve large optimization problems onboard, making it difficult for agents to replan at high rates. To overcome this challenge, we present our second key contribution, PRIMER, a learning-based planner trained with imitation learning (IL) using PARM* as the expert demonstrator. PRIMER leverages the low computational requirements at deployment of neural networks and achieves a computation speed up to 5500 times faster than optimization-based approaches.</p></details> | 7 pages, 3 figures |

However, they have seen limited application in real-world robotics tasks such as trajectory optimization. This is due to the difficulty in reasoning about collisions in radiance models and the computational complexity associated with operating in dense models. This paper addresses these challenges by proposing SPLANNING, a risk-aware trajectory optimizer operating in a Gaussian Splatting model. This paper first derives a method to rigorously upper-bound the probability of collision between a robot and a radiance field. Then, this paper introduces a normalized reformulation of Gaussian Splatting that enables efficient computation of this collision bound. Finally, this paper presents a method to optimize trajectories that avoid collisions in a Gaussian Splat. Experiments show that SPLANNING outperforms state-of-the-art methods in generating collision-free trajectories in cluttered environments.

While these systems offer unprecedented efficiency in transporting people and goods, they rely heavily on computation capability, safety-critical operations such as real-time navigation, environmental sensing, and trajectory tracking--necessitating robust offboard computational support. A widely adopted solution involves offloading these tasks to terrestrial base stations (BSs) along the flight path. However, air-to-ground connectivity is often constrained by spectrum conflicts with terrestrial users, which poses a significant challenge to maintaining reliable task execution. Cognitive radio (CR) techniques offer promising capabilities for dynamic spectrum access, making them a natural fit for addressing this issue. Existing studies often overlook the time-varying nature of BS resources, such as spectrum availability and CPU cycles, which leads to inaccurate trajectory planning, suboptimal offloading success rates, excessive energy consumption, and operational delays. To address these challenges, we propose a trajectory optimization framework for eVTOL swarms that maximizes task offloading success probability while minimizing both energy consumption and resource competition (e.g., spectrum and CPU cycles) with primary terrestrial users. The proposed algorithm integrates a Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) model to dynamically estimate BS resource availability and a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm to determine optimal offloading decisions, selecting both the BSs and access time windows that align with energy and temporal constraints.</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces a novel mixed Bernstein-Fourier approximation framework tailored explicitly for optimal motion planning. Our proposed methodology leverages the uniform convergence properties of Bernstein polynomials for nonperiodic behaviors while effectively capturing periodic dynamics through Fourier series. Theoretical results are established, including uniform convergence proofs for approximations of functions, derivatives, and integrals, as well as detailed error bound analyses. We further introduce a regulated least squares approach for determining approximation coefficients, enhancing numerical stability and practical applicability. Within an optimal control context, we establish feasibility and consistency of approximated solutions to their continuous counterparts. We also extend the covector mapping theorem, providing theoretical guarantees for approximating dual variables crucial in verifying the necessary optimality conditions from Pontryagin's Maximum Principle. Comprehensive numerical examples illustrate the method's superior performance, demonstrating substantial improvements in computational efficiency and precision in scenarios with complex periodic constraints and dynamics. Our mixed Bernstein-Fourier methodology thus presents a robust, theoretically grounded, and computationally efficient approach for advanced optimal trajectory planning in autonomous systems.</p></details> | 49 pages, 9 figures |

However, predictive modeling of such data remains challenging due to high dimensionality, irregular sampling, and data sparsity. To address these issues, we propose ImageFlowNet, a novel model designed to forecast disease trajectories from initial images while preserving spatial details. ImageFlowNet first learns multiscale joint representation spaces across patients and time points, then optimizes deterministic or stochastic flow fields within these spaces using a position-parameterized neural ODE/SDE framework. The model leverages a UNet architecture to create robust multiscale representations and mitigates data scarcity by combining knowledge from all patients. We provide theoretical insights that support our formulation of ODEs, and motivate our regularizations involving high-level visual features, latent space organization, and trajectory smoothness. We validate ImageFlowNet on three longitudinal medical image datasets depicting progression in geographic atrophy, multiple sclerosis, and glioblastoma, demonstrating its ability to effectively forecast disease progression and outperform existing methods. Our contributions include the development of ImageFlowNet, its theoretical underpinnings, and empirical validation on real-world datasets.

Operating in such settings presents many challenges -- most notably, because the agent cannot predict the ground-truth future paths of obstacles, a previously planned trajectory can become unsafe at any moment, requiring rapid replanning to avoid collisions. Recently developed planners have used soft-constraint approaches to achieve the necessary fast computation times; however, these methods do not guarantee collision-free paths even with static obstacles. In contrast, hard-constraint methods ensure collision-free safety, but typically have longer computation times. To address these issues, we propose three key contributions. First, the DYNUS Global Planner (DGP) and Temporal Safe Corridor Generation operate in spatio-temporal space and handle both static and dynamic obstacles in the 3D environment. Second, the Safe Planning Framework leverages a combination of exploratory, safe, and contingency trajectories to flexibly re-route when potential future collisions with dynamic obstacles are detected. Finally, the Fast Hard-Constraint Local Trajectory Formulation uses a variable elimination approach to reduce the problem size and enable faster computation by pre-computing dependencies between free and dependent variables while still ensuring collision-free trajectories. We evaluated DYNUS in a variety of simulations, including dense forests, confined office spaces, cave systems, and dynamic environments. Our experiments show that DYNUS achieves a success rate of 100% and travel times that are approximately 25.0% faster than state-of-the-art methods. We also evaluated DYNUS on multiple platforms -- a quadrotor, a wheeled robot, and a quadruped -- in both simulation and hardware experiments.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 30 figures, Under review at IEEE Transactions on Robotics</p></details> |

There is a urgent need to minimize the data size in LLM training. Compared with data selection method, the data distillation method aims to synthesize a small number of data samples to achieve the training effect of the full data set and has better flexibility. Despite its successes in computer vision, the discreteness of text data has hitherto stymied its exploration in natural language processing (NLP). In this work, we proposed a method that involves learning pseudo prompt data based on trajectory matching and finding its nearest neighbor ID to achieve cross-architecture transfer. During the distillation process, we introduce a regularization loss to improve the robustness of our distilled data. To our best knowledge, this is the first data distillation work suitable for text generation tasks such as instruction tuning. Evaluations on two benchmarks, including ARC-Easy and MMLU instruction tuning datasets, established the superiority of our distillation approach over the SOTA data selection method LESS. Furthermore, our method demonstrates a good transferability over LLM structures (i.e., OPT to Llama).</p></details> |  |

Our framework begins by generating panoptic occupancy local semantic maps and accurate localization information from data aligned between a monocular camera, IMU, and GPS. This information is combined with input terrain point clouds or preloaded terrain information to initialize the planning process. We propose the Radiant Field-Informed Coverage Planning algorithm, which utilizes a diffusion field model to dynamically adjust the robot's coverage trajectory and speed based on environmental attributes such as dirtiness and dryness. By modeling the spatial influence of the robot's actions using a Gaussian field, ensures a speed-optimized, uniform coverage trajectory while adapting to varying environmental conditions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Building Real-time Awareness of Out-of-distribution in Trajectory Prediction for Autonomous Vehicles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17277v2)** | 2025-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate trajectory prediction is essential for the safe operation of autonomous vehicles in real-world environments. Even well-trained machine learning models may produce unreliable predictions due to discrepancies between training data and real-world conditions encountered during inference. In particular, the training dataset tends to overrepresent common scenes (e.g., straight lanes) while underrepresenting less frequent ones (e.g., traffic circles). In addition, it often overlooks unpredictable real-world events such as sudden braking or falling objects. To ensure safety, it is critical to detect in real-time when a model's predictions become unreliable. Leveraging the intuition that in-distribution (ID) scenes exhibit error patterns similar to training data, while out-of-distribution (OOD) scenes do not, we introduce a principled, real-time approach for OOD detection by framing it as a change-point detection problem. We address the challenging settings where the OOD scenes are deceptive, meaning that they are not easily detectable by human intuitions. Our lightweight solutions can handle the occurrence of OOD at any time during trajectory prediction inference. Experimental results on multiple real-world datasets using a benchmark trajectory prediction model demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[TraCeS: Trajectory Based Credit Assignment From Sparse Safety Feedback](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12557v2)** | 2025-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In safe reinforcement learning (RL), auxiliary safety costs are used to align the agent to safe decision making. In practice, safety constraints, including cost functions and budgets, are unknown or hard to specify, as it requires anticipation of all possible unsafe behaviors. We therefore address a general setting where the true safety definition is unknown, and has to be learned from sparsely labeled data. Our key contributions are: first, we design a safety model that performs credit assignment to estimate each decision step's impact on the overall safety using a dataset of diverse trajectories and their corresponding binary safety labels (i.e., whether the corresponding trajectory is safe/unsafe). Second, we illustrate the architecture of our safety model to demonstrate its ability to learn a separate safety score for each timestep. Third, we reformulate the safe RL problem using the proposed safety model and derive an effective algorithm to optimize a safe yet rewarding policy. Finally, our empirical results corroborate our findings and show that this approach is effective in satisfying unknown safety definition, and scalable to various continuous control tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[SILM: A Subjective Intent Based Low-Latency Framework for Multiple Traffic Participants Joint Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16377v1)** | 2025-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction is a fundamental technology for advanced autonomous driving systems and represents one of the most challenging problems in the field of cognitive intelligence. Accurately predicting the future trajectories of each traffic participant is a prerequisite for building high safety and high reliability decision-making, planning, and control capabilities in autonomous driving. However, existing methods often focus solely on the motion of other traffic participants without considering the underlying intent behind that motion, which increases the uncertainty in trajectory prediction. Autonomous vehicles operate in real-time environments, meaning that trajectory prediction algorithms must be able to process data and generate predictions in real-time. While many existing methods achieve high accuracy, they often struggle to effectively handle heterogeneous traffic scenarios. In this paper, we propose a Subjective Intent-based Low-latency framework for Multiple traffic participants joint trajectory prediction. Our method explicitly incorporates the subjective intent of traffic participants based on their key points, and predicts the future trajectories jointly without map, which ensures promising performance while significantly reducing the prediction latency. Additionally, we introduce a novel dataset designed specifically for trajectory prediction. Related code and dataset will be available soon.</p></details> |  |

As this is a novel task, there is currently no relevant dataset available in the community. To address this gap, we first devised a new visualization language called Trajectory Visualization Language (TVL) to facilitate querying trajectory data and generating visualizations. Building on this foundation, we further proposed a dataset construction method that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) with human efforts to create high-quality data. Specifically, we first generate TVLs using a comprehensive and systematic process, and then label each TVL with corresponding natural language questions using LLMs. This process results in the creation of the first large-scale Text-to-TrajVis dataset, named TrajVL, which contains 18,140 (question, TVL) pairs. Based on this dataset, we systematically evaluated the performance of multiple LLMs (GPT, Qwen, Llama, etc.) on this task. The experimental results demonstrate that this task is both feasible and highly challenging and merits further exploration within the research community.</p></details> |  |
| **[DriVerse: Navigation World Model for Driving Simulation via Multimodal Trajectory Prompting and Motion Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18576v1)** | 2025-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents DriVerse, a generative model for simulating navigation-driven driving scenes from a single image and a future trajectory. Previous autonomous driving world models either directly feed the trajectory or discrete control signals into the generation pipeline, leading to poor alignment between the control inputs and the implicit features of the 2D base generative model, which results in low-fidelity video outputs. Some methods use coarse textual commands or discrete vehicle control signals, which lack the precision to guide fine-grained, trajectory-specific video generation, making them unsuitable for evaluating actual autonomous driving algorithms. DriVerse introduces explicit trajectory guidance in two complementary forms: it tokenizes trajectories into textual prompts using a predefined trend vocabulary for seamless language integration, and converts 3D trajectories into 2D spatial motion priors to enhance control over static content within the driving scene. To better handle dynamic objects, we further introduce a lightweight motion alignment module, which focuses on the inter-frame consistency of dynamic pixels, significantly enhancing the temporal coherence of moving elements over long sequences. With minimal training and no need for additional data, DriVerse outperforms specialized models on future video generation tasks across both the nuScenes and Waymo datasets. The code and models will be released to the public.</p></details> | 10 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Dynamic Intent Queries for Motion Transformer-based Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15766v1)** | 2025-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In autonomous driving, accurately predicting the movements of other traffic participants is crucial, as it significantly influences a vehicle's planning processes. Modern trajectory prediction models strive to interpret complex patterns and dependencies from agent and map data. The Motion Transformer (MTR) architecture and subsequent work define the most accurate methods in common benchmarks such as the Waymo Open Motion Benchmark. The MTR model employs pre-generated static intention points as initial goal points for trajectory prediction. However, the static nature of these points frequently leads to misalignment with map data in specific traffic scenarios, resulting in unfeasible or unrealistic goal points. Our research addresses this limitation by integrating scene-specific dynamic intention points into the MTR model. This adaptation of the MTR model was trained and evaluated on the Waymo Open Motion Dataset. Our findings demonstrate that incorporating dynamic intention points has a significant positive impact on trajectory prediction accuracy, especially for predictions over long time horizons. Furthermore, we analyze the impact on ground truth trajectories which are not compliant with the map data or are illegal maneuvers.</p></details> |  |
| **[SocialMOIF: Multi-Order Intention Fusion for Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15616v1)** | 2025-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The analysis and prediction of agent trajectories are crucial for decision-making processes in intelligent systems, with precise short-term trajectory forecasting being highly significant across a range of applications. Agents and their social interactions have been quantified and modeled by researchers from various perspectives; however, substantial limitations exist in the current work due to the inherent high uncertainty of agent intentions and the complex higher-order influences among neighboring groups. SocialMOIF is proposed to tackle these challenges, concentrating on the higher-order intention interactions among neighboring groups while reinforcing the primary role of first-order intention interactions between neighbors and the target agent. This method develops a multi-order intention fusion model to achieve a more comprehensive understanding of both direct and indirect intention information. Within SocialMOIF, a trajectory distribution approximator is designed to guide the trajectories toward values that align more closely with the actual data, thereby enhancing model interpretability. Furthermore, a global trajectory optimizer is introduced to enable more accurate and efficient parallel predictions. By incorporating a novel loss function that accounts for distance and direction during training, experimental results demonstrate that the model outperforms previous state-of-the-art baselines across multiple metrics in both dynamic and static datasets.</p></details> | 11 pages,6 figures |
| **[Offline Safe Reinforcement Learning Using Trajectory Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15429v5)** | 2025-04-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Offline safe reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a promising approach for learning safe behaviors without engaging in risky online interactions with the environment. Most existing methods in offline safe RL rely on cost constraints at each time step (derived from global cost constraints) and this can result in either overly conservative policies or violation of safety constraints. In this paper, we propose to learn a policy that generates desirable trajectories and avoids undesirable trajectories. To be specific, we first partition the pre-collected dataset of state-action trajectories into desirable and undesirable subsets. Intuitively, the desirable set contains high reward and safe trajectories, and undesirable set contains unsafe trajectories and low-reward safe trajectories. Second, we learn a policy that generates desirable trajectories and avoids undesirable trajectories, where (un)desirability scores are provided by a classifier learnt from the dataset of desirable and undesirable trajectories. This approach bypasses the computational complexity and stability issues of a min-max objective that is employed in existing methods. Theoretically, we also show our approach's strong connections to existing learning paradigms involving human feedback. Finally, we extensively evaluate our method using the DSRL benchmark for offline safe RL. Empirically, our method outperforms competitive baselines, achieving higher rewards and better constraint satisfaction across a wide variety of benchmark tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>AAAI ...</summary><p>AAAI 2025.

| **[Learning Through Retrospection: Improving Trajectory Prediction for Automated Driving with Error Feedback](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13785v1)** | 2025-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In automated driving, predicting trajectories of surrounding vehicles supports reasoning about scene dynamics and enables safe planning for the ego vehicle. However, existing models handle predictions as an instantaneous task of forecasting future trajectories based on observed information. As time proceeds, the next prediction is made independently of the previous one, which means that the model cannot correct its errors during inference and will repeat them. To alleviate this problem and better leverage temporal data, we propose a novel retrospection technique. Through training on closed-loop rollouts the model learns to use aggregated feedback. Given new observations it reflects on previous predictions and analyzes its errors to improve the quality of subsequent predictions. Thus, the model can learn to correct systematic errors during inference. Comprehensive experiments on nuScenes and Argoverse demonstrate a considerable decrease in minimum Average Displacement Error of up to 31.9% compared to the state-of-the-art baseline without retrospection. We further showcase the robustness of our technique by demonstrating a better handling of out-of-distribution scenarios with undetected road-users.</p></details> |  |
| **[Lightweight LiDAR-Camera 3D Dynamic Object Detection and Multi-Class Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13647v1)** | 2025-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Service mobile robots are often required to avoid dynamic objects while performing their tasks, but they usually have only limited computational resources. So we present a lightweight multi-modal framework for 3D object detection and trajectory prediction. Our system synergistically integrates LiDAR and camera inputs to achieve real-time perception of pedestrians, vehicles, and riders in 3D space. The framework proposes two novel modules: 1) a Cross-Modal Deformable Transformer (CMDT) for object detection with high accuracy and acceptable amount of computation, and 2) a Reference Trajectory-based Multi-Class Transformer (RTMCT) for efficient and diverse trajectory prediction of mult-class objects with flexible trajectory lengths. Evaluations on the CODa benchmark demonstrate superior performance over existing methods across detection (+2.03% in mAP) and trajectory prediction (-0.408m in minADE5 of pedestrians) metrics. Remarkably, the system exhibits exceptional deployability - when implemented on a wheelchair robot with an entry-level NVIDIA 3060 GPU, it achieves real-time inference at 13.2 fps. To facilitate reproducibility and practical deployment, we release the related code of the method at https://github.com/TossherO/3D_Perception and its ROS inference version at https://github.com/TossherO/ros_packages.</p></details> |  |
| **[Stochastic Trajectory Optimization for Robotic Skill Acquisition From a Suboptimal Demonstration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03131v4)** | 2025-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning from Demonstration (LfD) has emerged as a crucial method for robots to acquire new skills. However, when given suboptimal task trajectory demonstrations with shape characteristics reflecting human preferences but subpar dynamic attributes such as slow motion, robots not only need to mimic the behaviors but also optimize the dynamic performance. In this work, we leverage optimization-based methods to search for a superior-performing trajectory whose shape is similar to that of the demonstrated trajectory. Specifically, we use Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) to quantify the difference between two trajectories and combine it with additional performance metrics, such as collision cost, to construct the cost function. Moreover, we develop a multi-policy version of the Stochastic Trajectory Optimization for Motion Planning (STOMP), called MSTOMP, which is more stable and robust to parameter changes. To deal with the jitter in the demonstrated trajectory, we further utilize the gain-controlling method in the frequency domain to denoise the demonstration and propose a computationally more efficient metric, called Mean Square Error in the Spectrum (MSES), that measures the trajectories' differences in the frequency domain. We also theoretically highlight the connections between the time domain and the frequency domain methods. Finally, we verify our method in both simulation experiments and real-world experiments, showcasing its improved optimization performance and stability compared to existing methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Robust Estimation of Battery State of Health Using Reference Voltage Trajectory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13324v1)** | 2025-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate estimation of state of health (SOH) is critical for battery applications. Current model-based SOH estimation methods typically rely on low C-rate constant current tests to extract health parameters like solid phase volume fraction and lithium-ion stoichiometry, which are often impractical in real-world scenarios due to time and operational constraints. Additionally, these methods are susceptible to modeling uncertainties that can significantly degrade the estimation accuracy, especially when jointly estimating multiple parameters. In this paper, we present a novel reference voltage-based method for robust battery SOH estimation. This method utilizes the voltage response of a battery under a predefined current excitation at the beginning of life (BOL) as a reference to compensate for modeling uncertainty. As the battery degrades, the same excitation is applied to generate the voltage response, which is compared with the BOL trajectory to estimate the key health parameters accurately. The current excitation is optimally designed using the Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm to maximize the information content of the target parameters. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed method significantly improves parameter estimation accuracy under different degradation levels, compared to conventional methods relying only on direct voltage measurements. Furthermore, our method jointly estimates four key SOH parameters in only 10 minutes, making it practical for real-world battery health diagnostics, e.g., fast testing to enable battery repurposing.</p></details> |  |
| **[Uncertainty-Aware Trajectory Prediction via Rule-Regularized Heteroscedastic Deep Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13111v1)** | 2025-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning-based trajectory prediction models have demonstrated promising capabilities in capturing complex interactions. However, their out-of-distribution generalization remains a significant challenge, particularly due to unbalanced data and a lack of enough data and diversity to ensure robustness and calibration. To address this, we propose SHIFT (Spectral Heteroscedastic Informed Forecasting for Trajectories), a novel framework that uniquely combines well-calibrated uncertainty modeling with informative priors derived through automated rule extraction. SHIFT reformulates trajectory prediction as a classification task and employs heteroscedastic spectral-normalized Gaussian processes to effectively disentangle epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties. We learn informative priors from training labels, which are automatically generated from natural language driving rules, such as stop rules and drivability constraints, using a retrieval-augmented generation framework powered by a large language model. Extensive evaluations over the nuScenes dataset, including challenging low-data and cross-location scenarios, demonstrate that SHIFT outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving substantial gains in uncertainty calibration and displacement metrics. In particular, our model excels in complex scenarios, such as intersections, where uncertainty is inherently higher.

| **[Set You Straight: Auto-Steering Denoising Trajectories to Sidestep Unwanted Concepts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12782v1)** | 2025-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ensuring the ethical deployment of text-to-image models requires effective techniques to prevent the generation of harmful or inappropriate content. While concept erasure methods offer a promising solution, existing finetuning-based approaches suffer from notable limitations. Anchor-free methods risk disrupting sampling trajectories, leading to visual artifacts, while anchor-based methods rely on the heuristic selection of anchor concepts. To overcome these shortcomings, we introduce a finetuning framework, dubbed ANT, which Automatically guides deNoising Trajectories to avoid unwanted concepts. ANT is built on a key insight: reversing the condition direction of classifier-free guidance during mid-to-late denoising stages enables precise content modification without sacrificing early-stage structural integrity. This inspires a trajectory-aware objective that preserves the integrity of the early-stage score function field, which steers samples toward the natural image manifold, without relying on heuristic anchor concept selection. For single-concept erasure, we propose an augmentation-enhanced weight saliency map to precisely identify the critical parameters that most significantly contribute to the unwanted concept, enabling more thorough and efficient erasure. For multi-concept erasure, our objective function offers a versatile plug-and-play solution that significantly boosts performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ANT achieves state-of-the-art results in both single and multi-concept erasure, delivering high-quality, safe outputs without compromising the generative fidelity.

This work proposes a flexible language-based framework to adapt generic robotic trajectories produced by off-the-shelf motion planners like RRT, A-star, etc, or learned from human demonstrations. We utilize pre-trained LLMs to adapt trajectory waypoints by generating code as a policy for dense robot manipulation, enabling more complex and flexible instructions than current methods. This approach allows us to incorporate a broader range of commands, including numerical inputs. Compared to state-of-the-art feature-based sequence-to-sequence models which require training, our method does not require task-specific training and offers greater interpretability and more effective feedback mechanisms. We validate our approach through simulation experiments on the robotic manipulator, aerial vehicle, and ground robot in the Pybullet and Gazebo simulation environments, demonstrating that LLMs can successfully adapt trajectories to complex human instructions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CoRL LangRob workshop 2024</p></details> |

Recent score distillation methods distill a heavy teacher model into a student generator to achieve one-step generation, which is optimized by calculating the difference between the two score functions on the samples generated by the student model. However, there is a score mismatch issue in the early stage of the distillation process, because existing methods mainly focus on using the endpoint of pre-trained diffusion models as teacher models, overlooking the importance of the convergence trajectory between the student generator and the teacher model. To address this issue, we extend the score distillation process by introducing the entire convergence trajectory of teacher models and propose Distribution Backtracking Distillation (DisBack). DisBask is composed of two stages: Degradation Recording and Distribution Backtracking. Degradation Recording is designed to obtain the convergence trajectory of the teacher model, which records the degradation path from the trained teacher model to the untrained initial student generator. The degradation path implicitly represents the teacher model's intermediate distributions, and its reverse can be viewed as the convergence trajectory from the student generator to the teacher model. Then Distribution Backtracking trains a student generator to backtrack the intermediate distributions along the path to approximate the convergence trajectory of teacher models. Extensive experiments show that DisBack achieves faster and better convergence than the existing distillation method and accomplishes comparable generation performance, with FID score of 1.38 on ImageNet 64x64 dataset. Notably, DisBack is easy to implement and can be generalized to existing distillation methods to boost performance.

In complex environments, like modern 3D video games, distribution shift and stochasticity necessitate robust approaches beyond simple action replay. In this study, we apply Inverse Dynamics Models (IDM) with different encoders and policy heads to trajectory following in a modern 3D video game -- Bleeding Edge. Additionally, we investigate several future alignment strategies that address the distribution shift caused by the aleatoric uncertainty and imperfections of the agent. We measure both the trajectory deviation distance and the first significant deviation point between the reference and the agent's trajectory and show that the optimal configuration depends on the chosen setting. Our results show that in a diverse data setting, a GPT-style policy head with an encoder trained from scratch performs the best, DINOv2 encoder with the GPT-style policy head gives the best results in the low data regime, and both GPT-style and MLP-style policy heads had comparable results when pre-trained on a diverse setting and fine-tuned for a specific behaviour setting.</p></details> |  |

This overlooks the critical fact that the tires and the surface are the two force-transmitting partners in vehicle dynamics; while the tires stay with the vehicle, surface conditions vary with location. Recognizing these challenges, this paper presents a novel framework for spatially resolving dynamic constraints in both offline and online planning algorithms applied to autonomous racing. We introduce the GripMap concept, which provides a spatial resolution of vehicle dynamic constraints in the Frenet frame, allowing adaptation to locally varying grip conditions. This enables compensation for location-specific effects, more efficient vehicle behavior, and increased safety, unattainable with spatially invariant vehicle models. The focus is on low storage demand and quick access through perfect hashing. This framework proved advantageous in real-world applications in the presented form. Experiments inspired by autonomous racing demonstrate its effectiveness. In future work, this framework can serve as a foundational layer for developing future interpretable learning algorithms that adjust to varying grip conditions in real-time.</p></details> |  |

We propose to analyse facial landmark trajectories, a compact yet informative representation, that encodes these subtle motions from a high-level structural perspective. Hence, we introduce Trajectory-guided Motion Perception Transformer (TraMP-Former), a novel FEQA framework that fuses landmark trajectory features for fine-grained motion capture with visual semantic cues from RGB frames, ultimately regressing the combined features into a quality score. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TraMP-Former achieves new state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets with neurological disorders, including PFED5 (up by 6.51%) and an augmented Toronto NeuroFace (up by 7.62%). Our ablation studies further validate the efficiency and effectiveness of landmark trajectories in FEQA.

| **[Trajectory Encoding Temporal Graph Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11386v1)** | 2025-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal Graph Networks (TGNs) have demonstrated significant success in dynamic graph tasks such as link prediction and node classification. Both tasks comprise transductive settings, where the model predicts links among known nodes, and in inductive settings, where it generalises learned patterns to previously unseen nodes. Existing TGN designs face a dilemma under these dual scenarios. Anonymous TGNs, which rely solely on temporal and structural information, offer strong inductive generalisation but struggle to distinguish known nodes. In contrast, non-anonymous TGNs leverage node features to excel in transductive tasks yet fail to adapt to new nodes. To address this challenge, we propose Trajectory Encoding TGN (TETGN). Our approach introduces automatically expandable node identifiers (IDs) as learnable temporal positional features and performs message passing over these IDs to capture each node's historical context. By integrating this trajectory-aware module with a standard TGN using multi-head attention, TETGN effectively balances transductive accuracy with inductive generalisation. Experimental results on three real-world datasets show that TETGN significantly outperforms strong baselines on both link prediction and node classification tasks, demonstrating its ability to unify the advantages of anonymous and non-anonymous models for dynamic graph learning.</p></details> |  |

The context itself can be static (lanes, regulatory elements, etc) or dynamic (traffic participants). This paper presents a lane graph-based motion prediction model that first predicts graph-based goal proposals and later fuses them with cross attention over multiple contextual elements. We follow the famous encoder-interactor-decoder architecture where the encoder encodes scene context using lightweight Gated Recurrent Units, the interactor applies cross-context attention over encoded scene features and graph goal proposals, and the decoder regresses multimodal trajectories via Laplacian Mixture Density Network from the aggregated encodings. Using cross-attention over graph-based goal proposals gives robust trajectory estimates since the model learns to attend to future goal-relevant scene elements for the intended agent. We evaluate our work on nuScenes motion prediction dataset, achieving state-of-the-art results.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Robust Trajectory Embedding for Similarity Computation: When Triangle Inequality Violations in Distance Metrics Matter](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10933v1)** | 2025-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory similarity is a cornerstone of trajectory data management and analysis. Traditional similarity functions often suffer from high computational complexity and a reliance on specific distance metrics, prompting a shift towards deep representation learning in Euclidean space. However, existing Euclidean-based trajectory embeddings often face challenges due to the triangle inequality constraints that do not universally hold for trajectory data. To address this issue, this paper introduces a novel approach by incorporating non-Euclidean geometry, specifically hyperbolic space, into trajectory representation learning. We present the first-ever integration of hyperbolic space to resolve the inherent limitations of the triangle inequality in Euclidean embeddings. In particular, we achieve it by designing a Lorentz distance measure, which is proven to overcome triangle inequality constraints. Additionally, we design a model-agnostic framework LH-plugin to seamlessly integrate hyperbolic embeddings into existing representation learning pipelines. This includes a novel projection method optimized with the Cosh function to prevent the diminishment of distances, supported by a theoretical foundation. Furthermore, we propose a dynamic fusion distance that intelligently adapts to variations in triangle inequality constraints across different trajectory pairs, blending Lorentzian and Euclidean distances for more robust similarity calculations. Comprehensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that our approach effectively enhances the accuracy of trajectory similarity measures in state-of-the-art models across multiple real-world datasets. The LH-plugin not only addresses the triangle inequality issues but also significantly refines the precision of trajectory similarity computations, marking a substantial advancement in the field of trajectory representation learning.</p></details> | 14 pages, 8 figures |

Although predicting the ego-vehicle's path is valuable for driver-assistance systems, existing methods mainly focus on external factors like other vehicles' motions, often neglecting the driver's attention and intent. To address this gap, we infer the ego-trajectory by integrating the driver's gaze and the surrounding scene. We introduce RouteFormer, a novel multimodal ego-trajectory prediction network combining GPS data, environmental context, and the driver's field-of-view, comprising first-person video and gaze fixations. We also present the Path Complexity Index (PCI), a new metric for trajectory complexity that enables a more nuanced evaluation of challenging scenarios. To tackle data scarcity and enhance diversity, we introduce GEM, a comprehensive dataset of urban driving scenarios enriched with synchronized driver field-of-view and gaze data. Extensive evaluations on GEM and DR(eye)VE demonstrate that RouteFormer significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving notable improvements in prediction accuracy across diverse conditions. Ablation studies reveal that incorporating driver field-of-view data yields significantly better average displacement error, especially in challenging scenarios with high PCI scores, underscoring the importance of modeling driver attention.

This paper presents RINGO: Real-time Navigation with a Guiding Trajectory, a novel planning framework that enables aerial manipulators to navigate unknown environments in real time. The proposed method simultaneously considers the positions of both the multi-rotor and the end-effector. A pre-obtained multi-rotor trajectory serves as a guiding reference, allowing the end-effector to generate a smooth, collision-free, and workspace-compatible trajectory. Leveraging the convex hull property of B-spline curves, we theoretically guarantee that the trajectory remains within the reachable workspace. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that enables real-time navigation of aerial manipulators in unknown environments. The simulation and experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed method. The proposed method generates less conservative trajectories than approaches that consider only the multi-rotor.</p></details> | 9 pages, 15 figures |

In many real-world scenarios, where data collection is costly and risky, offline reinforcement learning (RL) offers a solution by utilizing data collected by domain experts and searching for a batch-constrained optimal policy. This approach is further augmented by incorporating external data sources, expanding the range and diversity of data collection possibilities. However, existing offline RL methods often struggle with challenges posed by non-matching data from these external sources. In this work, we specifically address the problem of source-target domain mismatch in scenarios involving mixed datasets, characterized by a predominance of source data generated from random or suboptimal policies and a limited amount of target data generated from higher-quality policies. To tackle this problem, we introduce Transition Scoring (TS), a novel method that assigns scores to transitions based on their similarity to the target domain, and propose Curriculum Learning-Based Trajectory Valuation (CLTV), which effectively leverages these transition scores to identify and prioritize high-quality trajectories through a curriculum learning approach. Our extensive experiments across various offline RL methods and MuJoCo environments, complemented by rigorous theoretical analysis, demonstrate that CLTV enhances the overall performance and transferability of policies learned by offline RL algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at AAMAS 2025</p></details> |
| **[Leveraging Knowledge Graphs and Large Language Models to Track and Analyze Learning Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11481v1)** | 2025-04-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study addresses the challenges of tracking and analyzing students' learning trajectories, particularly the issue of inadequate knowledge coverage in course assessments. Traditional assessment tools often fail to fully cover course content, leading to imprecise evaluations of student mastery. To tackle this problem, the study proposes a knowledge graph construction method based on large language models (LLMs), which transforms learning materials into structured data and generates personalized learning trajectory graphs by analyzing students' test data. Experimental results demonstrate that the model effectively alerts teachers to potential biases in their exam questions and tracks individual student progress. This system not only enhances the accuracy of learning assessments but also helps teachers provide timely guidance to students who are falling behind, thereby improving overall teaching strategies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Conformal Slit Mapping Based Spiral Tool Trajectory Planning for Ball-end Milling on Complex Freeform Surfaces](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06310v2)** | 2025-04-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study presents a spiral-based complete coverage strategy for ball-end milling on freeform surfaces, utilizing conformal slit mapping to generate milling trajectories that are more compact, smoother, and evenly distributed when machining 2D cavities with islands. This approach, an upgrade from traditional methods, extends the original algorithm to effectively address 3D perforated surface milling. Unlike conventional algorithms, the method embeds a continuous spiral trajectory within perforated surfaces without requiring cellular decomposition or additional boundaries. The proposed method addresses three primary challenges, including modifying conformal slit mapping for mesh surfaces, maintaining uniform scallop height between adjacent spiral trajectories, and optimizing the mapped origin point to ensure uniform scallop height distribution. To overcome these challenges, surface flattening techniques are incorporated into the original approach to accommodate mesh surfaces effectively. Tool path spacing is then optimized using a binary search strategy to regulate scallop height. A functional energy metric associated with scallop height uniformity is introduced for rapid evaluation of points mapped to the origin, with the minimum functional energy determined through perturbation techniques. The optimal placement of this point is identified using a modified gradient descent approach applied to the energy function. Validation on intricate surfaces, including low-quality and high-genus meshes, verifies the robustness of the algorithm. Surface milling experiments comparing this method with conventional techniques indicate a 15.63% improvement in scallop height uniformity while reducing machining time, average spindle impact, and spindle impact variance by up to 7.36%, 27.79%, and 55.98%, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>The r...</summary><p>The revised manuscript has improved the quality of the figures</p></details> |
| **[IMPACT: Behavioral Intention-aware Multimodal Trajectory Prediction with Adaptive Context Trimming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09103v1)** | 2025-04-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While most prior research has focused on improving the precision of multimodal trajectory predictions, the explicit modeling of multimodal behavioral intentions (e.g., yielding, overtaking) remains relatively underexplored. This paper proposes a unified framework that jointly predicts both behavioral intentions and trajectories to enhance prediction accuracy, interpretability, and efficiency. Specifically, we employ a shared context encoder for both intention and trajectory predictions, thereby reducing structural redundancy and information loss. Moreover, we address the lack of ground-truth behavioral intention labels in mainstream datasets (Waymo, Argoverse) by auto-labeling these datasets, thus advancing the community's efforts in this direction. We further introduce a vectorized occupancy prediction module that infers the probability of each map polyline being occupied by the target vehicle's future trajectory. By leveraging these intention and occupancy prediction priors, our method conducts dynamic, modality-dependent pruning of irrelevant agents and map polylines in the decoding stage, effectively reducing computational overhead and mitigating noise from non-critical elements. Our approach ranks first among LiDAR-free methods on the Waymo Motion Dataset and achieves first place on the Waymo Interactive Prediction Dataset. Remarkably, even without model ensembling, our single-model framework improves the soft mean average precision (softmAP) by 10 percent compared to the second-best method in the Waymo Interactive Prediction Leaderboard. Furthermore, the proposed framework has been successfully deployed on real vehicles, demonstrating its practical effectiveness in real-world applications.</p></details> | under review |

In this paper, we propose a novel method for trajectory synthesis by adapting the Time-Based Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (TimeVQVAE). Our approach leverages time-frequency domain processing, vector quantization, and transformer-based priors to capture both global and local dynamics in flight data. By discretizing the latent space and integrating transformer priors, the model learns long-range spatiotemporal dependencies and preserves coherence across entire flight paths. We evaluate the adapted TimeVQVAE using an extensive suite of quality, statistical, and distributional metrics, as well as a flyability assessment conducted in an open-source air traffic simulator. Results indicate that TimeVQVAE outperforms a temporal convolutional VAE baseline, generating synthetic trajectories that mirror real flight data in terms of spatial accuracy, temporal consistency, and statistical properties. Furthermore, the simulator-based assessment shows that most generated trajectories maintain operational feasibility, although occasional outliers underscore the potential need for additional domain-specific constraints. Overall, our findings underscore the importance of multi-scale representation learning for capturing complex flight behaviors and demonstrate the promise of TimeVQVAE in producing representative synthetic trajectories for downstream tasks such as model training, airspace design, and air traffic forecasting.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper was presented at the 25th Integrated Communications, Navigation and Surveillance Conference (ICNS 2025), April 8--10, 2025, Brussels, Belgium</p></details> |
| **[AgentRewardBench: Evaluating Automatic Evaluations of Web Agent Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08942v1)** | 2025-04-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Web agents enable users to perform tasks on web browsers through natural language interaction. Evaluating web agents trajectories is an important problem, since it helps us determine whether the agent successfully completed the tasks. Rule-based methods are widely used for this purpose, but they are challenging to extend to new tasks and may not always recognize successful trajectories. We may achieve higher accuracy through human evaluation, but the process would be substantially slower and more expensive. Automatic evaluations with LLMs may avoid the challenges of designing new rules and manually annotating trajectories, enabling faster and cost-effective evaluation. However, it is unclear how effective they are at evaluating web agents. To this end, we propose AgentRewardBench, the first benchmark to assess the effectiveness of LLM judges for evaluating web agents. AgentRewardBench contains 1302 trajectories across 5 benchmarks and 4 LLMs. Each trajectory in AgentRewardBench is reviewed by an expert, who answers questions pertaining to the success, side effects, and repetitiveness of the agent. Using our benchmark, we evaluate 12 LLM judges and find that no single LLM excels across all benchmarks. We also find that the rule-based evaluation used by common benchmarks tends to underreport the success rate of web agents, highlighting a key weakness of rule-based evaluation and the need to develop more flexible automatic evaluations. We release the benchmark at: https://agent-reward-bench.github.io</p></details> |  |

In This paper, an adaptive transpose Jacobian approach is proposed to deal with the dynamic model complexity, which utilizes an adaptive PI-algorithm to adjust the control gains. The performance of the proposed control algorithm is compared with the conventional transpose Jacobian and sliding mode control algorithms and evaluated by the root mean square of the errors and control input energy criteria. In order to appraise the effectiveness of the proposed control system, simulations are carried out in MATLAB/Simulink software for a quadruped robot leg for semi-elliptical path tracking. The obtained results show that the proposed adaptive transpose Jacobian reduces the overshoot and root mean square of the errors and at the same time, decreases the control input energy. Moreover, transpose Jacobin and adaptive transpose Jacobian are more robust to changes in initial conditions compared to the conventional sliding mode control. Furthermore, sliding mode control performs well up to 20% uncertainties in the parameters due to its model-based nature, whereas the transpose Jacobin and the proposed adaptive transpose Jacobian algorithms show promising results even in higher mass uncertainties.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in IEEE Xplore</p></details> |
| **[On trajectory design from motion primitives for near time-optimal transitions for systems with oscillating internal dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19144v2)** | 2025-04-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>An efficient approach to compute near time-optimal trajectories for linear kinematic systems with oscillatory internal dynamics is presented. Thereby, kinematic constraints with respect to velocity, acceleration and jerk are taken into account. The trajectories are composed of several motion primitives, the most crucial of which is termed jerk segment. Within this contribution, the focus is put on the composition of the overall trajectories, assuming the required motion primitives to be readily available. Since the scheme considered is not time-optimal, even decreasing particular constraints can reduce the overall transition time, which is analysed in detail. This observation implies that replanning of the underlying jerk segments is required as an integral part of the motion planning scheme, further insight into which has been analysed in a complementary contribution. Although the proposed scheme is not time-optimal, it allows for significantly shorter transition times than established methods, such as zero-vibration shaping, while requiring significantly lower computational power than a fully time-optimal scheme.</p></details> |  |

| **[Multi-Granular Attention based Heterogeneous Hypergraph Neural Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04340v1)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Heterogeneous graph neural networks (HeteGNNs) have demonstrated strong abilities to learn node representations by effectively extracting complex structural and semantic information in heterogeneous graphs. Most of the prevailing HeteGNNs follow the neighborhood aggregation paradigm, leveraging meta-path based message passing to learn latent node representations. However, due to the pairwise nature of meta-paths, these models fail to capture high-order relations among nodes, resulting in suboptimal performance. Additionally, the challenge of ``over-squashing'', where long-range message passing in HeteGNNs leads to severe information distortion, further limits the efficacy of these models. To address these limitations, this paper proposes MGA-HHN, a Multi-Granular Attention based Heterogeneous Hypergraph Neural Network for heterogeneous graph representation learning. MGA-HHN introduces two key innovations: (1) a novel approach for constructing meta-path based heterogeneous hypergraphs that explicitly models higher-order semantic information in heterogeneous graphs through multiple views, and (2) a multi-granular attention mechanism that operates at both the node and hyperedge levels. This mechanism enables the model to capture fine-grained interactions among nodes sharing the same semantic context within a hyperedge type, while preserving the diversity of semantics across different hyperedge types. As such, MGA-HHN effectively mitigates long-range message distortion and generates more expressive node representations. Extensive experiments on real-world benchmark datasets demonstrate that MGA-HHN outperforms state-of-the-art models, showcasing its effectiveness in node classification, node clustering and visualization tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Systematic Literature Review of Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Network Models for Time Series Forecasting and Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22377v2)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, spatio-temporal graph neural networks (GNNs) have attracted considerable interest in the field of time series analysis, due to their ability to capture dependencies among variables and across time points. The objective of the presented systematic literature review is hence to provide a comprehensive overview of the various modeling approaches and application domains of GNNs for time series classification and forecasting. A database search was conducted, and over 150 journal papers were selected for a detailed examination of the current state-of-the-art in the field. This examination is intended to offer to the reader a comprehensive collection of proposed models, links to related source code, available datasets, benchmark models, and fitting results. All this information is hoped to assist researchers in future studies. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic literature review presenting a detailed comparison of the results of current spatio-temporal GNN models in different domains. In addition, in its final part this review discusses current limitations and challenges in the application of spatio-temporal GNNs, such as comparability, reproducibility, explainability, poor information capacity, and scalability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Commute Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01635v6)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown remarkable success in learning from graph-structured data. However, their application to directed graphs (digraphs) presents unique challenges, primarily due to the inherent asymmetry in node relationships. Traditional GNNs are adept at capturing unidirectional relations but fall short in encoding the mutual path dependencies between nodes, such as asymmetrical shortest paths typically found in digraphs. Recognizing this gap, we introduce Commute Graph Neural Networks (CGNN), an approach that seamlessly integrates node-wise commute time into the message passing scheme. The cornerstone of CGNN is an efficient method for computing commute time using a newly formulated digraph Laplacian. Commute time is then integrated into the neighborhood aggregation process, with neighbor contributions weighted according to their respective commute time to the central node in each layer. It enables CGNN to directly capture the mutual, asymmetric relationships in digraphs. Extensive experiments on 8 benchmarking datasets confirm the superiority of CGNN against 13 state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

While previous studies show that dependency network metrics improve defect prediction, most methods focus on code-based dependency graphs, overlooking developer factors. Current metrics, based on handcrafted features like ego and global network metrics, fail to fully capture defect-related information. To address this, we propose DeMuVGN, a defect prediction model that learns multi-view software dependency via graph neural networks. We introduce a Multi-view Software Dependency Graph (MSDG) that integrates data, call, and developer dependencies. DeMuVGN also leverages the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) to address class imbalance and enhance defect module identification. In a case study of eight open-source projects across 20 versions, DeMuVGN demonstrates significant improvements: i) models based on multi-view graphs improve F1 scores by 11.1% to 12.1% over single-view models; ii) DeMuVGN improves F1 scores by 17.4% to 45.8% in within-project contexts and by 17.9% to 41.0% in cross-project contexts. Additionally, DeMuVGN excels in software evolution, showing more improvement in later-stage software versions. Its strong performance across different projects highlights its generalizability. We recommend future research focus on multi-view dependency graphs for defect prediction in both mature and newly developed projects.</p></details> | <details><summary>The c...</summary><p>The current paper is not comprehensive enough.

| **[Plexus: Taming Billion-edge Graphs with 3D Parallel GNN Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04083v1)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks have emerged as a potent class of neural networks capable of leveraging the connectivity and structure of real-world graphs to learn intricate properties and relationships between nodes. Many real-world graphs exceed the memory capacity of a GPU due to their sheer size, and using GNNs on them requires techniques such as mini-batch sampling to scale. However, this can lead to reduced accuracy in some cases, and sampling and data transfer from the CPU to the GPU can also slow down training. On the other hand, distributed full-graph training suffers from high communication overhead and load imbalance due to the irregular structure of graphs. We propose Plexus, a three-dimensional (3D) parallel approach for full-graph training that tackles these issues and scales to billion-edge graphs. Additionally, we introduce optimizations such as a permutation scheme for load balancing, and a performance model to predict the optimal 3D configuration. We evaluate Plexus on several graph datasets and show scaling results for up to 2048 GPUs on Perlmutter, which is 33% of the machine, and 2048 GCDs on Frontier. Plexus achieves unprecedented speedups of 2.3x-12.5x over existing methods and a reduction in the time to solution by 5.2-8.7x on Perlmutter and 7-54.2x on Frontier.</p></details> |  |
| **[Modal Decomposition and Identification for a Population of Structures Using Physics-Informed Graph Neural Networks and Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04018v1)** | 2025-05-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modal identification is crucial for structural health monitoring and structural control, providing critical insights into structural dynamics and performance. This study presents a novel deep learning framework that integrates graph neural networks (GNNs), transformers, and a physics-informed loss function to achieve modal decomposition and identification across a population of structures. The transformer module decomposes multi-degrees-of-freedom (MDOF) structural dynamic measurements into single-degree-of-freedom (SDOF) modal responses, facilitating the identification of natural frequencies and damping ratios. Concurrently, the GNN captures the structural configurations and identifies mode shapes corresponding to the decomposed SDOF modal responses. The proposed model is trained in a purely physics-informed and unsupervised manner, leveraging modal decomposition theory and the independence of structural modes to guide learning without the need for labeled data. Validation through numerical simulations and laboratory experiments demonstrates its effectiveness in accurately decomposing dynamic responses and identifying modal properties from sparse structural dynamic measurements, regardless of variations in external loads or structural configurations. Comparative analyses against established modal identification techniques and model variations further underscore its superior performance, positioning it as a favorable approach for population-based structural health monitoring.</p></details> |  |

Beyond the efficient allocation of system resources, schedulers must account for and optimize multiple performance metrics, including job wait time and system utilization. While traditional rule-based scheduling algorithms dominate the current deployments of HPC systems, the increasing heterogeneity and scale of those systems is expected to challenge the efficiency and flexibility of those algorithms in minimizing job wait time and maximizing utilization. Recent research efforts have focused on leveraging advancements in Reinforcement Learning (RL) to develop more adaptable and intelligent scheduling strategies. Recent RL-based scheduling approaches have explored a range of algorithms, from Deep Q-Networks (DQN) to Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), and more recently, hybrid methods that integrate Graph Neural Networks with RL techniques. However, a common limitation across these methods is their reliance on relatively small datasets, and these methods face scalability issues when using large datasets. This study introduces a novel RL-based scheduler utilizing the Decentralized Distributed Proximal Policy Optimization (DD-PPO) algorithm, which supports large-scale distributed training across multiple workers without requiring parameter synchronization at every step. By eliminating reliance on centralized updates to a shared policy, the DD-PPO scheduler enhances scalability, training efficiency, and sample utilization. The validation dataset leveraged over 11.5 million real HPC job traces for comparing DD-PPO performance between traditional and advanced scheduling approaches, and the experimental results demonstrate improved scheduling performance in comparison to both rule-based schedulers and existing RL-based scheduling algorithms.</p></details> |  |

However, due to privacy concerns or access restrictions, the network structure is often uncertain, thereby rendering established community detection approaches ineffective without costly network topology acquisition. To tackle this challenge, we present META-CODE, a unified framework for detecting overlapping communities via exploratory learning aided by easy-to-collect node metadata when networks are topologically unknown (or only partially known). Specifically, META-CODE consists of three iterative steps in addition to the initial network inference step: 1) node-level community-affiliation embeddings based on graph neural networks (GNNs) trained by our new reconstruction loss, 2) network exploration via community-affiliation-based node queries, and 3) network inference using an edge connectivity-based Siamese neural network model from the explored network. Through extensive experiments on three real-world datasets including two large networks, we demonstrate: (a) the superiority of META-CODE over benchmark community detection methods, achieving remarkable gains up to 65.55% on the Facebook dataset over the best competitor among our selected competitive methods in terms of normalized mutual information (NMI), (b) the impact of each module in META-CODE, (c) the effectiveness of node queries in META-CODE based on empirical evaluations and theoretical findings, and (d) the convergence of the inferred network.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 9 figures, 8 tables; IEEE Transactions on Network Science and Engineering (to appear) (Please cite our journal version.)</p></details> |

However, many existing tools overlook graph data and rarely combine these two aspects into a single solution. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become a popular approach, achieving top results across various tasks. We introduce GNN-AID (Graph Neural Network Analysis, Interpretation, and Defense), an open-source framework designed for graph data to address this gap. Built as a Python library, GNN-AID supports advanced trust methods and architectural layers, allowing users to analyze graph datasets and GNN behavior using attacks, defenses, and interpretability methods. GNN-AID is built on PyTorch-Geometric, offering preloaded datasets, models, and support for any GNNs through customizable interfaces. It also includes a web interface with tools for graph visualization and no-code features like an interactive model builder, simplifying the exploration and analysis of GNNs. The framework also supports MLOps techniques, ensuring reproducibility and result versioning to track and revisit analyses efficiently. GNN-AID is a flexible tool for developers and researchers. It helps developers create, analyze, and customize graph models, while also providing access to prebuilt datasets and models for quick experimentation. Researchers can use the framework to explore advanced topics on the relationship between interpretability and robustness, test defense strategies, and combine methods to protect against different types of attacks. We also show how defenses against evasion and poisoning attacks can conflict when applied to graph data, highlighting the complex connections between defense strategies.

The integration of massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) technology is being actively explored to enhance the performance of LEO satellite communications. However, the limited power of LEO satellites poses a significant challenge in improving communication energy efficiency (EE) under constrained power conditions. Artificial intelligence (AI) methods are increasingly recognized as promising solutions for optimizing energy consumption while enhancing system performance, thus enabling more efficient and sustainable communications. This paper proposes approaches to address the challenges associated with precoding in massive MIMO LEO satellite communications. First, we introduce an end-to-end graph neural network (GNN) framework that effectively reduces the computational complexity of traditional precoding methods. Next, we introduce a deep unfolding of the Dinkelbach algorithm and the weighted minimum mean square error (WMMSE) approach to achieve enhanced EE, transforming iterative optimization processes into a structured neural network, thereby improving convergence speed and computational efficiency. Furthermore, we incorporate the Taylor expansion method to approximate matrix inversion within the GNN, enhancing both the interpretability and performance of the proposed method. Numerical experiments demonstrate the validity of our proposed method in terms of complexity and robustness, achieving significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | 14 pages, 13 figures |

Recent studies have found that GNN models are vulnerable to backdoor attacks. When specific patterns (called backdoor triggers, e.g., subgraphs, nodes, etc.) appear in the input data, the backdoor embedded in the GNN models is activated, which misclassifies the input data into the target class label specified by the attacker, whereas when there are no backdoor triggers in the input, the backdoor embedded in the GNN models is not activated, and the models work normally. Backdoor attacks are highly stealthy and expose GNN models to serious security risks. Currently, research on backdoor attacks against GNNs mainly focus on tasks such as graph classification and node classification, and backdoor attacks against link prediction tasks are rarely studied. In this paper, we propose a backdoor attack against the link prediction tasks based on GNNs and reveal the existence of such security vulnerability in GNN models, which make the backdoored GNN models to incorrectly predict unlinked two nodes as having a link relationship when a trigger appear. The method uses a single node as the trigger and poison selected node pairs in the training graph, and then the backdoor will be embedded in the GNN models through the training process. In the inference stage, the backdoor in the GNN models can be activated by simply linking the trigger node to the two end nodes of the unlinked node pairs in the input data, causing the GNN models to produce incorrect link prediction results for the target node pairs.</p></details> |  |

Since genes are the foundation of cellular life, building gene regulatory networks (GRN) is essential to understand and predict the effects of genetic perturbations. However, current methods fail to fully leverage gene-related information, and solely rely on simple evaluation metrics to construct coarse-grained GRN. More importantly, they ignore functional differences between biotypes, limiting the ability to capture potential gene interactions. In this work, we leverage pre-trained large language model and DNA sequence model to extract features from gene descriptions and DNA sequence data, respectively, which serve as the initialization for gene representations. Additionally, we introduce gene biotype information for the first time in genetic perturbation, simulating the distinct roles of genes with different biotypes in regulating cellular processes, while capturing implicit gene relationships through graph structure learning (GSL). We propose GRAPE, a heterogeneous graph neural network (HGNN) that leverages gene representations initialized with features from descriptions and sequences, models the distinct roles of genes with different biotypes, and dynamically refines the GRN through GSL.

To address these limitations, we introduce Hamiltonian-Masked Autoencoding (HMAE), a novel self-supervised framework that pre-trains transformers on unlabeled quantum Hamiltonians, enabling efficient few-shot transfer learning. Unlike random masking approaches, HMAE employs a physics-informed strategy based on quantum information theory to selectively mask Hamiltonian terms based on their physical significance. Experiments on 12,500 quantum Hamiltonians (60% real-world, 40% synthetic) demonstrate that HMAE achieves 85.3% $\pm$ 1.5% accuracy in phase classification and 0.15 $\pm$ 0.02 eV MAE in ground state energy prediction with merely 10 labeled examples - a statistically significant improvement (p < 0.01) over classical graph neural networks (78.1% $\pm$ 2.1%) and quantum neural networks (76.8% $\pm$ 2.3%). Our method's primary advantage is exceptional sample efficiency - reducing required labeled examples by 3-5x compared to baseline methods - though we emphasize that ground truth values for fine-tuning and evaluation still require exact diagonalization or tensor networks. We explicitly acknowledge that our current approach is limited to small quantum systems (specifically limited to 12 qubits during training, with limited extension to 16-20 qubits in testing) and that, while promising within this regime, this size restriction prevents immediate application to larger systems of practical interest in materials science and quantum chemistry.</p></details> |  |

Given a hierarchical representation of the environment, the objective is to navigate from a start position to a goal while minimizing the computational cost. We introduce Hierarchical Class-ordered A* (HCOA*), an algorithm that leverages the environmental hierarchy for efficient path-planning in semantic graphs, significantly reducing computational effort. We use a total order over the semantic classes and prove theoretical performance guarantees for the algorithm. We propose two approaches for higher-layer node classification based on the node semantics of the lowest layer: a Graph Neural Network-based method and a Majority-Class method. We evaluate our approach through simulations on a 3D Scene Graph (3DSG), comparing it to the state-of-the-art and assessing its performance against our classification approaches. Results show that HCOA* can find the optimal path while reducing the number of expanded nodes by 25% and achieving a 16% reduction in computational time on the uHumans2 3DSG dataset.</p></details> | 6 pages, 4 figures |

Current clinical models do not effectively integrate the tumor's spatial heterogeneity, dynamic evolution, and complex multimodal data relationships, limiting their predictive accuracy. Our STG framework combines preoperative CT imaging and clinical data into a heterogeneous graph structure, enabling joint modeling of tumor distribution and temporal evolution through spatial topology and cross-modal edges. The framework uses GraphSAGE to aggregate spatiotemporal neighborhood information and leverages supervised and contrastive learning strategies to enhance the model's ability to capture temporal features and improve robustness. A lightweight version of the model reduces parameter count by 78.55%, maintaining near-state-of-the-art performance. The model jointly optimizes recurrence risk regression and survival analysis tasks, with contrastive loss improving feature representational discriminability and cross-modal consistency. Experimental results on the MSKCC CRLM dataset show a time-adjacent accuracy of 85% and a mean absolute error of 1.1005, significantly outperforming existing methods. The innovative heterogeneous graph construction and spatiotemporal decoupling mechanism effectively uncover the associations between dynamic tumor microenvironment changes and prognosis, providing reliable quantitative support for personalized treatment decisions.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 4 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |
| **[ABG-NAS: Adaptive Bayesian Genetic Neural Architecture Search for Graph Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21254v2)** | 2025-05-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Effective and efficient graph representation learning is essential for enabling critical downstream tasks, such as node classification, link prediction, and subgraph search. However, existing graph neural network (GNN) architectures often struggle to adapt to diverse and complex graph structures, limiting their ability to produce structure-aware and task-discriminative representations. To address this challenge, we propose ABG-NAS, a novel framework for automated graph neural network architecture search tailored for efficient graph representation learning. ABG-NAS encompasses three key components: a Comprehensive Architecture Search Space (CASS), an Adaptive Genetic Optimization Strategy (AGOS), and a Bayesian-Guided Tuning Module (BGTM). CASS systematically explores diverse propagation (P) and transformation (T) operations, enabling the discovery of GNN architectures capable of capturing intricate graph characteristics. AGOS dynamically balances exploration and exploitation, ensuring search efficiency and preserving solution diversity. BGTM further optimizes hyperparameters periodically, enhancing the scalability and robustness of the resulting architectures. Empirical evaluations on benchmark datasets (Cora, PubMed, Citeseer, and CoraFull) demonstrate that ABG-NAS consistently outperforms both manually designed GNNs and state-of-the-art neural architecture search (NAS) methods. These results highlight the potential of ABG-NAS to advance graph representation learning by providing scalable and adaptive solutions for diverse graph structures.

| **[Graph Neural Networks for Causal Inference Under Network Confounding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.07823v4)** | 2025-05-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper studies causal inference with observational data from a single large network. We consider a nonparametric model with interference in potential outcomes and selection into treatment. Both stages may be the outcomes of simultaneous equation models, which allow for endogenous peer effects. This results in high-dimensional network confounding where the network and covariates of all units constitute sources of selection bias. In contrast, the existing literature assumes that confounding can be summarized by a known, low-dimensional function of these objects. We propose to use graph neural networks (GNNs) to adjust for network confounding. When interference decays with network distance, we argue that the model has low-dimensional structure that makes estimation feasible and justifies the use of shallow GNN architectures.</p></details> |  |
| **[LGIN: Defining an Approximately Powerful Hyperbolic GNN](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00142v3)** | 2025-05-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While graph neural networks (GNNs) operating in hyperbolic spaces have shown promise for modeling hierarchical and complex relational data, a critical limitation often overlooked is their potentially limited discriminative power compared to their Euclidean counterparts or fundamental graph isomorphism tests like the Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) hierarchy. Existing hyperbolic aggregation schemes, while curvature-aware, may not sufficiently capture the intricate structural differences required to robustly distinguish non-isomorphic graphs owing to non-injective aggregation functions. To address this expressiveness gap in hyperbolic graph learning, we introduce the Lorentzian Graph Isomorphic Network (LGIN), a novel GNN designed to achieve enhanced discriminative capabilities within the Lorentzian model of hyperbolic space. LGIN proposes a new update rule that effectively combines local neighborhood information with a richer representation of graph structure designed to preserve the Lorentzian metric tensor. This represents a significant step towards building more expressive GNNs in non-Euclidean geometries, overcoming a common bottleneck in current hyperbolic methods. We conduct extensive evaluations across nine diverse benchmark datasets, including molecular and protein structures. LGIN consistently outperforms or matches state-of-the-art hyperbolic and Euclidean GNNs, showcasing its practical efficacy and validating its superior ability to capture complex graph structures and distinguish between different graphs. To the best of our knowledge, LGIN is the first work to study the framework behind a powerful GNN on the hyperbolic space.

| **[Interpretable Dynamic Graph Neural Networks for Small Occluded Object Detection and Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17251v8)** | 2025-05-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The detection and tracking of small, occluded objects such as pedestrians, cyclists, and motorbikes pose significant challenges for traffic surveillance systems because of their erratic movement, frequent occlusion, and poor visibility in dynamic urban environments. Traditional methods like YOLO11, while proficient in spatial feature extraction for precise detection, often struggle with these small and dynamically moving objects, particularly in handling real-time data updates and resource efficiency. This paper introduces DGNN-YOLO, a novel framework that integrates dynamic graph neural networks (DGNNs) with YOLO11 to address these limitations. Unlike standard GNNs, DGNNs are chosen for their superior ability to dynamically update graph structures in real-time, which enables adaptive and robust tracking of objects in highly variable urban traffic scenarios. This framework constructs and regularly updates its graph representations, capturing objects as nodes and their interactions as edges, thus effectively responding to rapidly changing conditions. Additionally, DGNN-YOLO incorporates Grad-CAM, Grad-CAM++, and Eigen-CAM visualization techniques to enhance interpretability and foster trust, offering insights into the model's decision-making process. Extensive experiments validate the framework's performance, achieving a precision of 0.8382, recall of 0.6875, and mAP@0.5:0.95 of 0.6476, significantly outperforming existing methods. This study offers a scalable and interpretable solution for real-time traffic surveillance and significantly advances intelligent transportation systems' capabilities by addressing the critical challenge of detecting and tracking small, occluded objects.</p></details> |  |

However, discovering reprogramming strategies through classical wet-lab experiments is hindered by lengthy time commitments and high costs. In this study, we explore the use of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to control Boolean network models of complex biological systems, such as gene regulatory networks and signalling pathway networks. We formulate a novel control problem for Boolean network models under the asynchronous update mode in the context of cellular reprogramming. To facilitate scalability, we consider our previously introduced concept of a pseudo-attractor and we improve our procedure for effective identification of pseudo-attractor states. Finally, we devise a computational framework to solve the control problem. To leverage the structure of biological systems, we incorporate graph neural networks with graph convolutions into the artificial neural network approximator for the action-value function learned by the DRL agent. Experiments on a number of large real-world biological networks from literature demonstrate the scalability and effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[Joint-Embedding Masked Autoencoder for Self-supervised Learning of Dynamic Functional Connectivity from the Human Brain](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06432v2)** | 2025-05-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown promise in learning dynamic functional connectivity for distinguishing phenotypes from human brain networks. However, obtaining extensive labeled clinical data for training is often resource-intensive, making practical application difficult. Leveraging unlabeled data thus becomes crucial for representation learning in a label-scarce setting. Although generative self-supervised learning techniques, especially masked autoencoders, have shown promising results in representation learning in various domains, their application to dynamic graphs for dynamic functional connectivity remains underexplored, facing challenges in capturing high-level semantic representations. Here, we introduce the Spatio-Temporal Joint Embedding Masked Autoencoder (ST-JEMA), drawing inspiration from the Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA) in computer vision. ST-JEMA employs a JEPA-inspired strategy for reconstructing dynamic graphs, which enables the learning of higher-level semantic representations considering temporal perspectives, addressing the challenges in fMRI data representation learning. Utilizing the large-scale UK Biobank dataset for self-supervised learning, ST-JEMA shows exceptional representation learning performance on dynamic functional connectivity demonstrating superiority over previous methods in predicting phenotypes and psychiatric diagnoses across eight benchmark fMRI datasets even with limited samples and effectiveness of temporal reconstruction on missing data scenarios. These findings highlight the potential of our approach as a robust representation learning method for leveraging label-scarce fMRI data.</p></details> | Under review |

This paper introduces Grasp the Graph 2.0 (GtG 2.0) method, a lightweight yet highly effective hypothesis-and-test robotics grasping framework which leverages an ensemble of Graph Neural Networks for efficient geometric reasoning from point cloud data. Building on the success of GtG 1.0, which demonstrated the potential of Graph Neural Networks for grasp detection but was limited by assumptions of complete, noise-free point clouds and 4-Dof grasping, GtG 2.0 employs a conventional Grasp Pose Generator to efficiently produce 7-Dof grasp candidates. Candidates are assessed with an ensemble Graph Neural Network model which includes points within the gripper jaws (inside points) and surrounding contextual points (outside points). This improved representation boosts grasp detection performance over previous methods using the same generator. GtG 2.0 shows up to a 35% improvement in Average Precision on the GraspNet-1Billion benchmark compared to hypothesis-and-test and Graph Neural Network-based methods, ranking it among the top three frameworks. Experiments with a 3-Dof Delta Parallel robot and Kinect-v1 camera show a success rate of 91% and a clutter completion rate of 100%, demonstrating its flexibility and reliability.</p></details> | 9 Pages, 6 figures |
| **[Rethinking Federated Graph Learning: A Data Condensation Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02573v1)** | 2025-05-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated graph learning is a widely recognized technique that promotes collaborative training of graph neural networks (GNNs) by multi-client graphs.However, existing approaches heavily rely on the communication of model parameters or gradients for federated optimization and fail to adequately address the data heterogeneity introduced by intricate and diverse graph distributions. Although some methods attempt to share additional messages among the server and clients to improve federated convergence during communication, they introduce significant privacy risks and increase communication overhead. To address these issues, we introduce the concept of a condensed graph as a novel optimization carrier to address FGL data heterogeneity and propose a new FGL paradigm called FedGM. Specifically, we utilize a generalized condensation graph consensus to aggregate comprehensive knowledge from distributed graphs, while minimizing communication costs and privacy risks through a single transmission of the condensed data. Extensive experiments on six public datasets consistently demonstrate the superiority of FedGM over state-of-the-art baselines, highlighting its potential for a novel FGL paradigm.</p></details> |  |

However, the interplay between model interpretability and robustness remains poorly understood, especially under adversarial scenarios like poisoning and evasion attacks. This paper presents a comprehensive benchmark to systematically analyze the impact of various factors on the interpretability of GNNs, including the influence of robustness-enhancing defense mechanisms. We evaluate six GNN architectures based on GCN, SAGE, GIN, and GAT across five datasets from two distinct domains, employing four interpretability metrics: Fidelity, Stability, Consistency, and Sparsity. Our study examines how defenses against poisoning and evasion attacks, applied before and during model training, affect interpretability and highlights critical trade-offs between robustness and interpretability. The framework will be published as open source. The results reveal significant variations in interpretability depending on the chosen defense methods and model architecture characteristics. By establishing a standardized benchmark, this work provides a foundation for developing GNNs that are both robust to adversarial threats and interpretable, facilitating trust in their deployment in sensitive applications.</p></details> |  |

However, the synergistic integration of these two approaches remains underexplored. This work introduces a novel architecture, the Hierarchical Uncertainty-Aware Graph Neural Network (HU-GNN), which unifies multi-scale representation learning, principled uncertainty estimation, and self-supervised embedding diversity within a single end-to-end framework. Specifically, HU-GNN adaptively forms node clusters and estimates uncertainty at multiple structural scales from individual nodes to higher levels. These uncertainty estimates guide a robust message-passing mechanism and attention weighting, effectively mitigating noise and adversarial perturbations while preserving predictive accuracy on semi-supervised classification tasks. We also offer key theoretical contributions, including a probabilistic formulation, rigorous uncertainty-calibration guarantees, and formal robustness bounds. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art robustness and interpretability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Inference-friendly Graph Compression for Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13034v2)** | 2025-05-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated promising performance in graph analysis. Nevertheless, the inference process of GNNs remains costly, hindering their applications for large graphs. This paper proposes inference-friendly graph compression (IFGC), a graph compression scheme to accelerate GNNs inference. Given a graph $G$ and a GNN $M$, an IFGC computes a small compressed graph $G_c$, to best preserve the inference results of $M$ over $G$, such that the result can be directly inferred by accessing $G_c$ with no or little decompression cost. (1) We characterize IFGC with a class of inference equivalence relation. The relation captures the node pairs in $G$ that are not distinguishable for GNN inference. (2) We introduce three practical specifications of IFGC for representative GNNs: structural preserving compression (SPGC), which computes $G_c$ that can be directly processed by GNN inference without decompression; ($\alpha$, $r$)-compression, that allows for a configurable trade-off between compression ratio and inference quality, and anchored compression that preserves inference results for specific nodes of interest. For each scheme, we introduce compression and inference algorithms with guarantees of efficiency and quality of the inferred results. We conduct extensive experiments on diverse sets of large-scale graphs, which verifies the effectiveness and efficiency of our graph compression approaches.</p></details> |  |

Despite their predictive power, these models often suffer from limited interpretability, raising concerns for scientific applications that require reliable and transparent insights. While existing methods have primarily focused on explaining molecular substructures in 2D GNNs, the transition to 3D GNNs introduces unique challenges, such as handling the implicit dense edge structures created by a cut-off radius. To tackle this, we introduce a novel explanation method specifically designed for 3D GNNs, which localizes the explanation to the immediate neighborhood of each node within the 3D space. Each node is assigned an radius of influence, defining the localized region within which message passing captures spatial and structural interactions crucial for the model's predictions. This method leverages the spatial and geometric characteristics inherent in 3D graphs. By constraining the subgraph to a localized radius of influence, the approach not only enhances interpretability but also aligns with the physical and structural dependencies typical of 3D graph applications, such as molecular learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Attention Mechanisms Perspective: Exploring LLM Processing of Graph-Structured Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02130v1)** | 2025-05-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Attention mechanisms are critical to the success of large language models (LLMs), driving significant advancements in multiple fields. However, for graph-structured data, which requires emphasis on topological connections, they fall short compared to message-passing mechanisms on fixed links, such as those employed by Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). This raises a question: ``Does attention fail for graphs in natural language settings?'' Motivated by these observations, we embarked on an empirical study from the perspective of attention mechanisms to explore how LLMs process graph-structured data. The goal is to gain deeper insights into the attention behavior of LLMs over graph structures. We uncovered unique phenomena regarding how LLMs apply attention to graph-structured data and analyzed these findings to improve the modeling of such data by LLMs. The primary findings of our research are: 1) While LLMs can recognize graph data and capture text-node interactions, they struggle to model inter-node relationships within graph structures due to inherent architectural constraints. 2) The attention distribution of LLMs across graph nodes does not align with ideal structural patterns, indicating a failure to adapt to graph topology nuances. 3) Neither fully connected attention nor fixed connectivity is optimal; each has specific limitations in its application scenarios. Instead, intermediate-state attention windows improve LLM training performance and seamlessly transition to fully connected windows during inference.

Existing methods usually focus on implicitly modeling audio and visual features through weak labels, without mining semantic relationships for different modalities and explicit modeling of event temporal dependencies. This makes it difficult for the model to accurately parse event information for each segment under weak supervision, especially when high similarity between segmental modal features leads to ambiguous event boundaries. Hence, we propose a multimodal optimization framework, TeMTG, that combines text enhancement and multi-hop temporal graph modeling. Specifically, we leverage pre-trained multimodal models to generate modality-specific text embeddings, and fuse them with audio-visual features to enhance the semantic representation of these features. In addition, we introduce a multi-hop temporal graph neural network, which explicitly models the local temporal relationships between segments, capturing the temporal continuity of both short-term and long-range events. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in multiple key indicators in the LLP dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICMR 2025</p></details> |

In recent years, inspired by self-supervised learning (SSL), contrastive learning (CL)-based Heterogeneous Graphs Neural Networks (HGNNs) have shown great potential in utilizing data augmentation and contrastive discriminators for downstream tasks. However, data augmentation remains limited due to the graph data's integrity. Furthermore, the contrastive discriminators suffer from sampling bias and lack local heterogeneous information. To tackle the above limitations, we propose a novel Generative-Contrastive Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network (GC-HGNN). Specifically, we propose a heterogeneous graph generative learning method that enhances CL-based paradigm. This paradigm includes: 1) A contrastive view augmentation strategy using a masked autoencoder. 2) Position-aware and semantics-aware positive sample sampling strategy for generating hard negative samples. 3) A hierarchical contrastive learning strategy aimed at capturing local and global information. Furthermore, the hierarchical contrastive learning and sampling strategies aim to constitute an enhanced contrastive discriminator under the generative-contrastive perspective. Finally, we compare our model with seventeen baselines on eight real-world datasets. Our model outperforms the latest baselines on node classification and link prediction tasks.</p></details> | 12 pages, 8 figures |

This leads to a paucity of optimal solution, constraining the effectiveness of conventional deep learning approaches. Most existing learning-based methods necessitate extensive optimal data and fail to exploit the potential benefits of suboptimal data that can be obtained with greater efficiency and effectiveness. Taking the multi-server multi-user computation offloading (MSCO) problem, which is widely observed in systems like Internet-of-Vehicles (IoV) and Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) networks, as a concrete scenario, we present a Graph Diffusion-based Solution Generation (GDSG) method. This approach is designed to work with suboptimal datasets while converging to the optimal solution large probably. We transform the optimization issue into distribution-learning and offer a clear explanation of learning from suboptimal training datasets. We build GDSG as a multi-task diffusion model utilizing a Graph Neural Network (GNN) to acquire the distribution of high-quality solutions. We use a simple and efficient heuristic approach to obtain a sufficient amount of training data composed entirely of suboptimal solutions. In our implementation, we enhance the backbone GNN and achieve improved generalization. GDSG also reaches nearly 100\% task orthogonality, ensuring no interference between the discrete and continuous generation tasks. We further reveal that this orthogonality arises from the diffusion-related training loss, rather than the neural network architecture itself. The experiments demonstrate that GDSG surpasses other benchmark methods on both the optimal and suboptimal training datasets. The MSCO datasets has open-sourced at this http URL, as well as the GDSG algorithm codes at https://github.com/qiyu3816/GDSG.</p></details> | Accepted by IEEE TMC |

However, these methods may cause misalignment problem in the feature fusion process and counter-intuitive patches in the segmentation results. Inspired by the popular pixel-node-pixel pipeline, we propose to 1) fuse features from two modalities in a late fusion style, during which the geometric feature injection is guided by texture feature prior; 2) employ Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) on the fused feature to alleviate the emergence of irregular patches by inferring patch relationship. At the 3D feature extraction stage, we argue that traditional CNNs are not efficient enough for depth maps. So, we encode depth map into normal map, after which CNNs can easily extract object surface tendencies.At projection matrix generation stage, we find the existence of Biased-Assignment and Ambiguous-Locality issues in the original pipeline. Therefore, we propose to 1) adopt the Kullback-Leibler Loss to ensure no missing important pixel features, which can be viewed as hard pixel mining process; 2) connect regions that are close to each other in the Euclidean space as well as in the semantic space with larger edge weights so that location informations can been considered. Extensive experiments on two public datasets, NYU-DepthV2 and SUN RGB-D, have shown that our approach can consistently boost the performance of RGB-D semantic segmentation task.</p></details> | <details><summary>I hav...</summary><p>I have decided to withdraw this paper because I have recently obtained some new data and insights during my ongoing research</p></details> |

While Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) excel in spatial feature extraction, they often neglect inter-image relational dependencies, leading to misclassifications. This paper proposes an interpretable hybrid Sequential CNN-Graph Neural Network (GNN) framework that synergizes MobileNetV2 for localized feature extraction and GraphSAGE for relational modeling. The framework constructs a graph where nodes represent leaf images, with edges defined by cosine similarity-based adjacency matrices and adaptive neighborhood sampling. This design captures fine-grained lesion features and global symptom patterns, addressing inter-class similarity challenges. Cross-modal interpretability is achieved via Grad-CAM and Eigen-CAM visualizations, generating heatmaps to highlight disease-influential regions. Evaluated on a dataset of ten soybean leaf diseases, the model achieves $97.16\%$ accuracy, surpassing standalone CNNs ($\le95.04\%$) and traditional machine learning models ($\le77.05\%$). Ablation studies validate the sequential architecture's superiority over parallel or single-model configurations. With only 2.3 million parameters, the lightweight MobileNetV2-GraphSAGE combination ensures computational efficiency, enabling real-time deployment in resource-constrained environments. The proposed approach bridges the gap between accurate classification and practical applicability, offering a robust, interpretable tool for agricultural diagnostics while advancing CNN-GNN integration in plant pathology research.</p></details> |  |
| **[Logical Characterizations of Recurrent Graph Neural Networks with Reals and Floats](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14606v4)** | 2025-05-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In pioneering work from 2019, Barcel\'o and coauthors identified logics that precisely match the expressive power of constant iteration-depth graph neural networks (GNNs) relative to properties definable in first-order logic. In this article, we give exact logical characterizations of recurrent GNNs in two scenarios: (1) in the setting with floating-point numbers and (2) with reals. For floats, the formalism matching recurrent GNNs is a rule-based modal logic with counting, while for reals we use a suitable infinitary modal logic, also with counting. These results give exact matches between logics and GNNs in the recurrent setting without relativising to a background logic in either case, but using some natural assumptions about floating-point arithmetic. Applying our characterizations, we also prove that, relative to graph properties definable in monadic second-order logic (MSO), our infinitary and rule-based logics are equally expressive. This implies that recurrent GNNs with reals and floats have the same expressive power over MSO-definable properties and shows that, for such properties, also recurrent GNNs with reals are characterized by a (finitary!) rule-based modal logic. In the general case, in contrast, the expressive power with floats is weaker than with reals. In addition to logic-oriented results, we also characterize recurrent GNNs, with both reals and floats, via distributed automata, drawing links to distributed computing models.</p></details> |  |

Existing approaches predominantly integrate LLMs with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), using GNNs as feature encoders or auxiliary components. However, directly encoding graph structures within LLMs has been underexplored, particularly in the context of large-scale graphs where token limitations hinder effective representation. To address these challenges, we propose SDM-InstructGLM, a novel instruction-tuned Graph Language Model (InstructGLM) framework that enhances scalability and efficiency without relying on GNNs. Our method introduces a similarity-degree-based biased random walk mechanism, which selectively samples and encodes graph information based on node-feature similarity and degree centrality, ensuring an adaptive and structured representation within the LLM. This approach significantly improves token efficiency, mitigates information loss due to random sampling, and enhances performance on graph-based tasks such as node classification and link prediction. Furthermore, our results demonstrate the feasibility of LLM-only graph processing, enabling scalable and interpretable Graph Language Models (GLMs) optimized through instruction-based fine-tuning. This work paves the way for GNN-free approaches to graph learning, leveraging LLMs as standalone graph reasoning models.

| **[Identifying Root Cause of bugs by Capturing Changed Code Lines with Relational Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00990v1)** | 2025-05-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Just-In-Time defect prediction model helps development teams improve software quality and efficiency by assessing whether code changes submitted by developers are likely to introduce defects in real-time, allowing timely identification of potential issues during the commit stage. However, two main challenges exist in current work due to the reality that all deleted and added lines in bug-fixing commits may be related to the root cause of the introduced bug: 1) lack of effective integration of heterogeneous graph information, and 2) lack of semantic relationships between changed code lines. To address these challenges, we propose a method called RC-Detection, which utilizes relational graph convolutional network to capture the semantic relationships between changed code lines. RC-Detection is used to detect root-cause deletion lines in changed code lines, thereby identifying the root cause of introduced bugs in bug-fixing commits. To evaluate the effectiveness of RC-Detection, we used three datasets that contain high-quality bug-fixing and bug-introducing commits. Extensive experiments were conducted to evaluate the performance of our model by collecting data from 87 open-source projects, including 675 bug-fix commits. The experimental results show that, compared to the most advanced root cause detection methods, RC-Detection improved Recall@1, Recall@2, Recall@3, and MFR by at 4.107%, 5.113%, 4.289%, and 24.536%, respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[SA-GAT-SR: Self-Adaptable Graph Attention Networks with Symbolic Regression for high-fidelity material property prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00625v2)** | 2025-05-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in machine learning have demonstrated an enormous utility of deep learning approaches, particularly Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for materials science. These methods have emerged as powerful tools for high-throughput prediction of material properties, offering a compelling enhancement and alternative to traditional first-principles calculations. While the community has predominantly focused on developing increasingly complex and universal models to enhance predictive accuracy, such approaches often lack physical interpretability and insights into materials behavior. Here, we introduce a novel computational paradigm, Self-Adaptable Graph Attention Networks integrated with Symbolic Regression (SA-GAT-SR), that synergistically combines the predictive capability of GNNs with the interpretative power of symbolic regression. Our framework employs a self-adaptable encoding algorithm that automatically identifies and adjust attention weights so as to screen critical features from an expansive 180-dimensional feature space while maintaining O(n) computational scaling. The integrated SR module subsequently distills these features into compact analytical expressions that explicitly reveal quantum-mechanically meaningful relationships, achieving 23 times acceleration compared to conventional SR implementations that heavily rely on first principle calculations-derived features as input. This work suggests a new framework in computational materials science, bridging the gap between predictive accuracy and physical interpretability, offering valuable physical insights into material behavior.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mesh-based Super-Resolution of Fluid Flows with Multiscale Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07769v4)** | 2025-05-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A graph neural network (GNN) approach is introduced in this work which enables mesh-based three-dimensional super-resolution of fluid flows. In this framework, the GNN is designed to operate not on the full mesh-based field at once, but on localized meshes of elements (or cells) directly. To facilitate mesh-based GNN representations in a manner similar to spectral (or finite) element discretizations, a baseline GNN layer (termed a message passing layer, which updates local node properties) is modified to account for synchronization of coincident graph nodes, rendering compatibility with commonly used element-based mesh connectivities. The architecture is multiscale in nature, and is comprised of a combination of coarse-scale and fine-scale message passing layer sequences (termed processors) separated by a graph unpooling layer. The coarse-scale processor embeds a query element (alongside a set number of neighboring coarse elements) into a single latent graph representation using coarse-scale synchronized message passing over the element neighborhood, and the fine-scale processor leverages additional message passing operations on this latent graph to correct for interpolation errors. Demonstration studies are performed using hexahedral mesh-based data from Taylor-Green Vortex and backward-facing step flow simulations at Reynolds numbers of 1600 and 3200. Through analysis of both global and local errors, the results ultimately show how the GNN is able to produce accurate super-resolved fields compared to targets in both coarse-scale and multiscale model configurations. Reconstruction errors for fixed architectures were found to increase in proportion to the Reynolds number. Geometry extrapolation studies on a separate cavity flow configuration show promising cross-mesh capabilities of the super-resolution strategy.</p></details> |  |
| **[OmniSage: Large Scale, Multi-Entity Heterogeneous Graph Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17811v2)** | 2025-05-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Representation learning, a task of learning latent vectors to represent entities, is a key task in improving search and recommender systems in web applications. Various representation learning methods have been developed, including graph-based approaches for relationships among entities, sequence-based methods for capturing the temporal evolution of user activities, and content-based models for leveraging text and visual content. However, the development of a unifying framework that integrates these diverse techniques to support multiple applications remains a significant challenge. This paper presents OmniSage, a large-scale representation framework that learns universal representations for a variety of applications at Pinterest. OmniSage integrates graph neural networks with content-based models and user sequence models by employing multiple contrastive learning tasks to effectively process graph data, user sequence data, and content signals. To support the training and inference of OmniSage, we developed an efficient infrastructure capable of supporting Pinterest graphs with billions of nodes. The universal representations generated by OmniSage have significantly enhanced user experiences on Pinterest, leading to an approximate 2.5% increase in sitewide repins (saves) across five applications. This paper highlights the impact of unifying representation learning methods, and we will open source the OmniSage code by the time of publication.</p></details> |  |
| **[TeLoGraF: Temporal Logic Planning via Graph-encoded Flow Matching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00562v1)** | 2025-05-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning to solve complex tasks with signal temporal logic (STL) specifications is crucial to many real-world applications. However, most previous works only consider fixed or parametrized STL specifications due to the lack of a diverse STL dataset and encoders to effectively extract temporal logic information for downstream tasks. In this paper, we propose TeLoGraF, Temporal Logic Graph-encoded Flow, which utilizes Graph Neural Networks (GNN) encoder and flow-matching to learn solutions for general STL specifications. We identify four commonly used STL templates and collect a total of 200K specifications with paired demonstrations. We conduct extensive experiments in five simulation environments ranging from simple dynamical models in the 2D space to high-dimensional 7DoF Franka Panda robot arm and Ant quadruped navigation. Results show that our method outperforms other baselines in the STL satisfaction rate. Compared to classical STL planning algorithms, our approach is 10-100X faster in inference and can work on any system dynamics. Besides, we show our graph-encoding method's capability to solve complex STLs and robustness to out-distribution STL specifications.

This becomes even more critical during anomaly conditions like the epidemic outbreak, during which couriers' delivery timely rate will decline markedly and fluctuates significantly. Existing studies pay less attention to the logistics scenario. Moreover, many works focusing on prediction tasks in anomaly scenarios fail to explicitly model abnormal events, e.g., treating external factors equally with other features, resulting in great information loss. Further, since some anomalous events occur infrequently, traditional data-driven methods perform poorly in these scenarios. To deal with them, we propose a deep spatial-temporal attention model, named DeepSTA. To be specific, to avoid information loss, we design an anomaly spatio-temporal learning module that employs a recurrent neural network to model incident information. Additionally, we utilize Node2vec to model correlations between road districts, and adopt graph neural networks and long short-term memory to capture the spatial-temporal dependencies of couriers. To tackle the issue of insufficient training data in abnormal circumstances, we propose an anomaly pattern attention module that adopts a memory network for couriers' anomaly feature patterns storage via attention mechanisms. The experiments on real-world logistics datasets during the COVID-19 outbreak in 2022 show the model outperforms the best baselines by 12.11% in MAE and 13.71% in MSE, demonstrating its superior performance over multiple competitive baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CIKM 2023</p></details> |
| **[From GNNs to Trees: Multi-Granular Interpretability for Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00364v1)** | 2025-05-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Interpretable Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) aim to reveal the underlying reasoning behind model predictions, attributing their decisions to specific subgraphs that are informative. However, existing subgraph-based interpretable methods suffer from an overemphasis on local structure, potentially overlooking long-range dependencies within the entire graphs. Although recent efforts that rely on graph coarsening have proven beneficial for global interpretability, they inevitably reduce the graphs to a fixed granularity. Such an inflexible way can only capture graph connectivity at a specific level, whereas real-world graph tasks often exhibit relationships at varying granularities (e.g., relevant interactions in proteins span from functional groups, to amino acids, and up to protein domains). In this paper, we introduce a novel Tree-like Interpretable Framework (TIF) for graph classification, where plain GNNs are transformed into hierarchical trees, with each level featuring coarsened graphs of different granularity as tree nodes. Specifically, TIF iteratively adopts a graph coarsening module to compress original graphs (i.e., root nodes of trees) into increasingly coarser ones (i.e., child nodes of trees), while preserving diversity among tree nodes within different branches through a dedicated graph perturbation module. Finally, we propose an adaptive routing module to identify the most informative root-to-leaf paths, providing not only the final prediction but also the multi-granular interpretability for the decision-making process. Extensive experiments on the graph classification benchmarks with both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of TIF in interpretability, while also delivering a competitive prediction performance akin to the state-of-the-art counterparts.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICLR 2025</p></details> |
| **[Repetition Makes Perfect: Recurrent Sum-GNNs Match Message Passing Limit](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00291v1)** | 2025-05-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We provide first tight bounds for the expressivity of Recurrent Graph Neural Networks (recurrent GNNs) with finite-precision parameters. We prove that recurrent GNNs, with sum aggregation and ReLU activation, can emulate any graph algorithm that respects the natural message-passing invariance induced by the color refinement (or Weisfeiler-Leman) algorithm. While it is well known that the expressive power of GNNs is limited by this invariance [Morris et al., AAAI 2019; Xu et al., ICLR 2019], we establish that recurrent GNNs can actually reach this limit. This is in contrast to non-recurrent GNNs, which have the power of Weisfeiler-Leman only in a very weak, "non-uniform", sense where every graph size requires a different GNN model to compute with. The emulation we construct introduces only a polynomial overhead in both time and space. Furthermore, we show that by incorporating random initialization, recurrent GNNs can emulate all graph algorithms, implying in particular that any graph algorithm with polynomial-time complexity can be emulated by a recurrent GNN with random initialization, running in polynomial time.</p></details> |  |
