| **[Functional-SVD for Heterogeneous Trajectories: Case Studies in Health](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03619v5)** | 2026-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory data, including time series and longitudinal measurements, are increasingly common in health-related domains such as biomedical research and epidemiology. Real-world trajectory data frequently exhibit heterogeneity across subjects such as patients, sites, and subpopulations, yet many traditional methods are not designed to accommodate such heterogeneity in data analysis. To address this, we propose a unified framework, termed Functional Singular Value Decomposition (FSVD), for statistical learning with heterogeneous trajectories. We establish the theoretical foundations of FSVD and develop a corresponding estimation algorithm that accommodates noisy and irregular observations. We further adapt FSVD to a wide range of trajectory-learning tasks, including dimension reduction, factor modeling, regression, clustering, and data completion, while preserving its ability to account for heterogeneity, leverage inherent smoothness, and handle irregular sampling. Through extensive simulations, we demonstrate that FSVD-based methods consistently outperform existing approaches across these tasks. Finally, we apply FSVD to a COVID-19 case-count dataset and electronic health record datasets, showcasing its effective performance in global and subgroup pattern discovery and factor analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>Journ...</summary><p>Journal of the American Statistical Association, to appear</p></details> |
| **[fev-bench: A Realistic Benchmark for Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26468v2)** | 2026-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Benchmark quality is critical for meaningful evaluation and sustained progress in time series forecasting, particularly with the rise of pretrained models. Existing benchmarks often have limited domain coverage or overlook real-world settings such as tasks with covariates. Their aggregation procedures frequently lack statistical rigor, making it unclear whether observed performance differences reflect true improvements or random variation. Many benchmarks lack consistent evaluation infrastructure or are too rigid for integration into existing pipelines. To address these gaps, we propose fev-bench, a benchmark of 100 forecasting tasks across seven domains, including 46 with covariates. Supporting the benchmark, we introduce fev, a lightweight Python library for forecasting evaluation emphasizing reproducibility and integration with existing workflows. Using fev, fev-bench employs principled aggregation with bootstrapped confidence intervals to report performance along two dimensions: win rates and skill scores. We report results on fev-bench for pretrained, statistical, and baseline models and identify promising future research directions.</p></details> |  |
| **[CoGenCast: A Coupled Autoregressive-Flow Generative Framework for Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03564v1)** | 2026-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting can be viewed as a generative problem that requires both semantic understanding over contextual conditions and stochastic modeling of continuous temporal dynamics. Existing approaches typically rely on either autoregressive large language models (LLMs) for semantic context modeling or diffusion-like models for continuous probabilistic generation. However, neither method alone can adequately model both aspects simultaneously. In this work, we propose CoGenCast, a hybrid generative framework that couples pre-trained LLMs with flow-matching mechanism for effective time series forecasting. Specifically, we reconfigure pre-trained decoder-only LLMs into a native forecasting encoder-decoder backbone by modifying only the attention topology, enabling bidirectional context encoding and causal representation generation. Building on this, a flow-matching mechanism is further integrated to model temporal evolution, capturing continuous stochastic dynamics conditioned on the autoregressively generated representation. Notably, CoGenCast naturally supports multimodal forecasting and cross-domain unified training. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks show that CoGenCast consistently outperforms previous compared baselines. Code is available at https://github.com/liuyaguo/_CoGenCast.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dataset-Driven Channel Masks in Transformers for Multivariate Time Series](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23222v2)** | 2026-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in foundation models have been successfully extended to the time series (TS) domain, facilitated by the emergence of large-scale TS datasets. However, previous efforts have primarily Capturing channel dependency (CD) is essential for modeling multivariate time series (TS), and attention-based methods have been widely employed for this purpose. Nonetheless, these methods primarily focus on modifying the architecture, often neglecting the importance of dataset-specific characteristics. In this work, we introduce the concept of partial channel dependence (PCD) to enhance CD modeling in Transformer-based models by leveraging dataset-specific information to refine the CD captured by the model. To achieve PCD, we propose channel masks (CMs), which are integrated into the attention matrices of Transformers via element-wise multiplication. CMs consist of two components: 1) a similarity matrix that captures relationships between the channels, and 2) dataset-specific and learnable domain parameters that refine the similarity matrix. We validate the effectiveness of PCD across diverse tasks and datasets with various backbones. Code is available at this repository: https://github.com/YonseiML/pcd.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICASS...</summary><p>ICASSP 2026.

| **[SEDformer: Event-Synchronous Spiking Transformers for Irregular Telemetry Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02230v2)** | 2026-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Telemetry streams from large-scale Internet-connected systems (e.g., IoT deployments and online platforms) naturally form an irregular multivariate time series (IMTS) whose accurate forecasting is operationally vital. A closer examination reveals a defining Sparsity-Event Duality (SED) property of IMTS, i.e., long stretches with sparse or no observations are punctuated by short, dense bursts where most semantic events (observations) occur. However, existing Graph- and Transformer-based forecasters ignore SED: pre-alignment to uniform grids with heavy padding violates sparsity by inflating sequences and forcing computation at non-informative steps, while relational recasting weakens event semantics by disrupting local temporal continuity. These limitations motivate a more faithful and natural modeling paradigm for IMTS that aligns with its SED property. We find that Spiking Neural Networks meet this requirement, as they communicate via sparse binary spikes and update in an event-driven manner, aligning naturally with the SED nature of IMTS. Therefore, we present SEDformer, an SED-enhanced Spiking Transformer for telemetry IMTS forecasting that couples: (1) a SED-based Spike Encoder converts raw observations into event synchronous spikes using an Event-Aligned LIF neuron, (2) an Event-Preserving Temporal Downsampling module compresses long gaps while retaining salient firings and (3) a stack of SED-based Spike Transformer blocks enable intra-series dependency modeling with a membrane-based linear attention driven by EA-LIF spiking features. Experiments on public telemetry IMTS datasets show that SEDformer attains state-of-the-art forecasting accuracy while reducing energy and memory usage, providing a natural and efficient path for modeling IMTS.</p></details> | Under review |
| **[MoGU: Mixture-of-Gaussians with Uncertainty-based Gating for Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07459v2)** | 2026-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce Mixture-of-Gaussians with Uncertainty-based Gating (MoGU), a novel Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework designed for regression tasks. MoGU replaces standard learned gating with an intrinsic routing paradigm where expert-specific uncertainty serves as the native gating signal. By modeling each prediction as a Gaussian distribution, the system utilizes predicted variance to dynamically weight expert contributions. We validate MoGU on multivariate time-series forecasting, a domain defined by high volatility and varying noise patterns. Empirical results across multiple benchmarks, horizon lengths, and backbones demonstrate that MoGU consistently improves forecasting accuracy compared to traditional MoE. Further evaluation via conformal prediction indicates that our approach yields more efficient prediction intervals than existing baselines. These findings highlight MoGU's capacity for providing both competitive performance and reliable, high-fidelity uncertainty quantification.

| **[A Pipeline for ADNI Resting-State Functional MRI Processing and Quality Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03278v1)** | 2026-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) provides a comprehensive multimodal neuroimaging resource for studying aging and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Since its second wave, ADNI has increasingly collected resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI), a valuable resource for discovering brain connectivity changes predictive of cognitive decline and AD. A major barrier to its use is the considerable variability in acquisition protocols and data quality, compounded by missing imaging sessions and inconsistencies in how functional scans temporally align with clinical assessments. As a result, many studies only utilize a small subset of the total rs-fMRI data, limiting statistical power, reproducibility, and the ability to study longitudinal functional brain changes at scale. Here, we describe a pipeline for ADNI rs-fMRI data that encompasses the download of necessary imaging and clinical data, temporally aligning the clinical and imaging data, preprocessing, and quality control. We integrate data curation and preprocessing across all ADNI sites and scanner types using a combination of open-source software (Clinica, fMRIPrep, and MRIQC) and bespoke tools. Quality metrics and reports are generated for each subject and session to facilitate rigorous data screening. All scripts and configuration files are available to enable reproducibility. The pipeline, which currently supports ADNI-GO, ADNI-2, and ADNI-3 data releases, outputs high-quality rs-fMRI time series data adhering to the BIDS-derivatives specification. This protocol provides a transparent and scalable framework for curating and utilizing ADNI fMRI data, empowering large-scale functional biomarker discovery and integrative multimodal analyses in Alzheimer's disease research.</p></details> |  |
| **[MemCast: Memory-Driven Time Series Forecasting with Experience-Conditioned Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03164v1)** | 2026-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting (TSF) plays a critical role in decision-making for many real-world applications. Recently, LLM-based forecasters have made promising advancements. Despite their effectiveness, existing methods often lack explicit experience accumulation and continual evolution. In this work, we propose MemCast, a learning-to-memory framework that reformulates TSF as an experience-conditioned reasoning task. Specifically, we learn experience from the training set and organize it into a hierarchical memory. This is achieved by summarizing prediction results into historical patterns, distilling inference trajectories into reasoning wisdom, and inducing extracted temporal features into general laws. Furthermore, during inference, we leverage historical patterns to guide the reasoning process and utilize reasoning wisdom to select better trajectories, while general laws serve as criteria for reflective iteration. Additionally, to enable continual evolution, we design a dynamic confidence adaptation strategy that updates the confidence of individual entries without leaking the test set distribution. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that MemCast consistently outperforms previous methods, validating the effectiveness of our approach. Our code is available at https://github.com/Xiaoyu-Tao/MemCast-TS.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spectral Text Fusion: A Frequency-Aware Approach to Multimodal Time-Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01588v2)** | 2026-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal time series forecasting is crucial in real-world applications, where decisions depend on both numerical data and contextual signals. The core challenge is to effectively combine temporal numerical patterns with the context embedded in other modalities, such as text. While most existing methods align textual features with time-series patterns one step at a time, they neglect the multiscale temporal influences of contextual information such as time-series cycles and dynamic shifts. This mismatch between local alignment and global textual context can be addressed by spectral decomposition, which separates time series into frequency components capturing both short-term changes and long-term trends. In this paper, we propose SpecTF, a simple yet effective framework that integrates the effect of textual data on time series in the frequency domain. Our method extracts textual embeddings, projects them into the frequency domain, and fuses them with the time series' spectral components using a lightweight cross-attention mechanism. This adaptively reweights frequency bands based on textual relevance before mapping the results back to the temporal domain for predictions. Experimental results demonstrate that SpecTF significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models across diverse multi-modal time series datasets while utilizing considerably fewer parameters. Code is available at https://github.com/hiepnh137/SpecTF.</p></details> |  |
| **[Moirai 2.0: When Less Is More for Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11698v3)** | 2026-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce Moirai 2.0, a decoder-only time-series foundation model trained on a new corpus of 36M series. The model adopts quantile forecasting and multi-token prediction, improving both probabilistic accuracy and inference efficiency. On the Gift-Eval benchmark, it ranks among the top pretrained models while achieving a strong trade-off between accuracy, speed, and model size. Compared to Moirai 1.0, Moirai 2.0 replaces masked-encoder training, multi-patch inputs, and mixture-distribution outputs with a simpler decoder-only architecture, single patch, and quantile loss. Ablation studies isolate these changes -- showing that the decoder-only backbone along with recursive multi-quantile decoding contribute most to the gains. Additional experiments show that Moirai 2.0 outperforms larger models from the same family and exhibits robust domain-level results. In terms of efficiency and model size, Moirai 2.0 is twice as fast and thirty times smaller than its prior best version, Moirai 1.0-Large, while also performing better. Model performance plateaus with increasing parameter count and declines at longer horizons, motivating future work on data scaling and long-horizon modeling. We release code and evaluation details to support further research.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 13 figures, and 1 table</p></details> |
| **[COMET: Codebook-based Online-adaptive Multi-scale Embedding for Time-series Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01635v2)** | 2026-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series anomaly detection is a critical task across various industrial domains. However, capturing temporal dependencies and multivariate correlations within patch-level representation learning remains underexplored, and reliance on single-scale patterns limits the detection of anomalies across different temporal ranges. Furthermore, focusing on normal data representations makes models vulnerable to distribution shifts at inference time. To address these limitations, we propose Codebook-based Online-adaptive Multi-scale Embedding for Time-series anomaly detection (COMET), which consists of three key components: (1) Multi-scale Patch Encoding captures temporal dependencies and inter-variable correlations across multiple patch scales. (2) Vector-Quantized Coreset learns representative normal patterns via codebook and detects anomalies with a dual-score combining quantization error and memory distance. (3) Online Codebook Adaptation generates pseudo-labels based on codebook entries and dynamically adapts the model at inference through contrastive learning. Experiments on five benchmark datasets demonstrate that COMET achieves the best performance in 36 out of 45 evaluation metrics, validating its effectiveness across diverse environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Stationarity and Spectral Characterization of Random Signals on Simplicial Complexes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03055v1)** | 2026-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>It is increasingly common for data to possess intricate structure, necessitating new models and analytical tools. Graphs, a prominent type of structure, can encode the relationships between any two entities (nodes). However, graphs neither allow connections that are not dyadic nor permit relationships between sets of nodes. We thus turn to simplicial complexes for connecting more than two nodes as well as modeling relationships between simplices, such as edges and triangles. Our data then consist of signals lying on topological spaces, represented by simplicial complexes. Much recent work explores these topological signals, albeit primarily through deterministic formulations. We propose a probabilistic framework for random signals defined on simplicial complexes. Specifically, we generalize the classical notion of stationarity. By spectral dualities of Hodge and Dirac theory, we define stationary topological signals as the outputs of topological filters given white noise. This definition naturally extends desirable properties of stationarity that hold for both time-series and graph signals. Crucially, we properly define topological power spectral density (PSD) through a clear spectral characterization. We then discuss the advantages of topological stationarity due to spectral properties via the PSD. In addition, we empirically demonstrate the practicality of these benefits through multiple synthetic and real-world simulations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Visual Reasoning over Time Series via Multi-Agent System](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03026v1)** | 2026-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series analysis underpins many real-world applications, yet existing time-series-specific methods and pretrained large-model-based approaches remain limited in integrating intuitive visual reasoning and generalizing across tasks with adaptive tool usage. To address these limitations, we propose MAS4TS, a tool-driven multi-agent system for general time series tasks, built upon an Analyzer-Reasoner-Executor paradigm that integrates agent communication, visual reasoning, and latent reconstruction within a unified framework. MAS4TS first performs visual reasoning over time series plots with structured priors using a Vision-Language Model to extract temporal structures, and subsequently reconstructs predictive trajectories in latent space. Three specialized agents coordinate via shared memory and gated communication, while a router selects task-specific tool chains for execution. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that MAS4TS achieves state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of time series tasks, while exhibiting strong generalization and efficient inference.</p></details> |  |
| **[Causal Graph Spatial-Temporal Autoencoder for Reliable and Interpretable Process Monitoring](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03004v1)** | 2026-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To improve the reliability and interpretability of industrial process monitoring, this article proposes a Causal Graph Spatial-Temporal Autoencoder (CGSTAE). The network architecture of CGSTAE combines two components: a correlation graph structure learning module based on spatial self-attention mechanism (SSAM) and a spatial-temporal encoder-decoder module utilizing graph convolutional long-short term memory (GCLSTM). The SSAM learns correlation graphs by capturing dynamic relationships between variables, while a novel three-step causal graph structure learning algorithm is introduced to derive a causal graph from these correlation graphs. The algorithm leverages a reverse perspective of causal invariance principle to uncover the invariant causal graph from varying correlations. The spatial-temporal encoder-decoder, built with GCLSTM units, reconstructs time-series process data within a sequence-to-sequence framework. The proposed CGSTAE enables effective process monitoring and fault detection through two statistics in the feature space and residual space. Finally, we validate the effectiveness of CGSTAE in process monitoring through the Tennessee Eastman process and a real-world air separation process.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Role of Entanglement in Quantum Reservoir Computing with Coupled Kerr Nonlinear Oscillators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11175v2)** | 2026-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum Reservoir Computing (QRC) uses quantum dynamics to efficiently process temporal data. In this work, we investigate a QRC framework based on two coupled Kerr nonlinear oscillators, a system well-suited for time-series prediction tasks due to its complex nonlinear interactions and potentially high-dimensional state space. We explore how its performance in forecasting both linear and nonlinear time-series depends on key physical parameters: input drive strength, Kerr nonlinearity, and oscillator coupling, and analyze the role of entanglement in improving the reservoir's computational performance, focusing on its effect on predicting non-trivial time series. Using logarithmic negativity to quantify entanglement and normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) to evaluate predictive accuracy, our results suggest that entanglement provides a computational advantage on average -- up to a threshold in the input frequency -- that persists under some levels of dissipation and dephasing. In particular, we find that higher dissipation rates can enhance performance. While the entanglement advantage manifests as improvements in both average and worst-case performance, it does not lead to improvements in the best-case error. These findings contribute to the broader understanding of quantum reservoirs for high performance, efficient quantum machine learning and time-series forecasting.</p></details> |  |
| **[HALT: Hallucination Assessment via Log-probs as Time series](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02888v1)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hallucinations remain a major obstacle for large language models (LLMs), especially in safety-critical domains. We present HALT (Hallucination Assessment via Log-probs as Time series), a lightweight hallucination detector that leverages only the top-20 token log-probabilities from LLM generations as a time series. HALT uses a gated recurrent unit model combined with entropy-based features to learn model calibration bias, providing an extremely efficient alternative to large encoders. Unlike white-box approaches, HALT does not require access to hidden states or attention maps, relying only on output log-probabilities. Unlike black-box approaches, it operates on log-probs rather than surface-form text, which enables stronger domain generalization and compatibility with proprietary LLMs without requiring access to internal weights. To benchmark performance, we introduce HUB (Hallucination detection Unified Benchmark), which consolidates prior datasets into ten capabilities covering both reasoning tasks (Algorithmic, Commonsense, Mathematical, Symbolic, Code Generation) and general purpose skills (Chat, Data-to-Text, Question Answering, Summarization, World Knowledge). While being 30x smaller, HALT outperforms Lettuce, a fine-tuned modernBERT-base encoder, achieving a 60x speedup gain on HUB. HALT and HUB together establish an effective framework for hallucination detection across diverse LLM capabilities.</p></details> |  |
| **[SC3D: Dynamic and Differentiable Causal Discovery for Temporal and Instantaneous Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02830v1)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Discovering causal structures from multivariate time series is a key problem because interactions span across multiple lags and possibly involve instantaneous dependencies. Additionally, the search space of the dynamic graphs is combinatorial in nature. In this study, we propose \textit{Stable Causal Dynamic Differentiable Discovery (SC3D)}, a two-stage differentiable framework that jointly learns lag-specific adjacency matrices and, if present, an instantaneous directed acyclic graph (DAG). In Stage 1, SC3D performs edge preselection through node-wise prediction to obtain masks for lagged and instantaneous edges, whereas Stage 2 refines these masks by optimizing a likelihood with sparsity along with enforcing acyclicity on the instantaneous block. Numerical results across synthetic and benchmark dynamical systems demonstrate that SC3D achieves improved stability and more accurate recovery of both lagged and instantaneous causal structures compared to existing temporal baselines.</p></details> | 8 pages |
| **[S4ECG: Exploring the impact of long-range interactions for arrhythmia prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17406v2)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The electrocardiogram (ECG) exemplifies biosignal-based time series with continuous, temporally ordered structure reflecting cardiac physiological and pathophysiological dynamics. Detailed analysis of these dynamics has proven challenging, as conventional methods capture either global trends or local waveform features but rarely their simultaneous interplay at high temporal resolution. To bridge global and local signal analysis, we introduce S4ECG, a novel deep learning architecture leveraging structured state space models for multi-epoch arrhythmia classification. Our joint multi-epoch predictions significantly outperform single-epoch approaches by 1.0-11.6% in macro-AUROC, with atrial fibrillation specificity improving from 0.718-0.979 to 0.967-0.998, demonstrating superior performance in-distribution and enhanced out-of-distribution robustness. Systematic investigation reveals optimal temporal dependency windows spanning 10-20 minutes for peak performance. This work contributes to a paradigm shift toward temporally-aware arrhythmia detection algorithms, opening new possibilities for ECG interpretation, in particular for complex arrhythmias like atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter.</p></details> |  |
| **[Cross-Temporal Attention Fusion (CTAF) for Multimodal Physiological Signals in Self-Supervised Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02784v1)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study multimodal affect modeling when EEG and peripheral physiology are asynchronous, which most fusion methods ignore or handle with costly warping. We propose Cross-Temporal Attention Fusion (CTAF), a self-supervised module that learns soft bidirectional alignments between modalities and builds a robust clip embedding using time-aware cross attention, a lightweight fusion gate, and alignment-regularized contrastive objectives with optional weak supervision. On the K-EmoCon dataset, under leave-one-out cross-validation evaluation, CTAF yields higher cosine margins for matched pairs and better cross-modal token retrieval within one second, and it is competitive with the baseline on three-bin accuracy and macro-F1 while using few labels. Our contributions are a time-aware fusion mechanism that directly models correspondence, an alignment-driven self-supervised objective tailored to EEG and physiology, and an evaluation protocol that measures alignment quality itself. Our approach accounts for the coupling between the central and autonomic nervous systems in psychophysiological time series. These results indicate that CTAF is a strong step toward label-efficient, generalizable EEG-peripheral fusion under temporal asynchrony.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exposing Vulnerabilities in Explanation for Time Series Classifiers via Dual-Target Attacks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02763v1)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Interpretable time series deep learning systems are often assessed by checking temporal consistency on explanations, implicitly treating this as evidence of robustness. We show that this assumption can fail: Predictions and explanations can be adversarially decoupled, enabling targeted misclassification while the explanation remains plausible and consistent with a chosen reference rationale. We propose TSEF (Time Series Explanation Fooler), a dual-target attack that jointly manipulates the classifier and explainer outputs. In contrast to single-objective misclassification attacks that disrupt explanation and spread attribution mass broadly, TSEF achieves targeted prediction changes while keeping explanations consistent with the reference. Across multiple datasets and explainer backbones, our results consistently reveal that explanation stability is a misleading proxy for decision robustness and motivate coupling-aware robustness evaluations for trustworthy time series tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[CAPS: Unifying Attention, Recurrence, and Alignment in Transformer-based Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02729v1)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents $\textbf{CAPS}$ (Clock-weighted Aggregation with Prefix-products and Softmax), a structured attention mechanism for time series forecasting that decouples three distinct temporal structures: global trends, local shocks, and seasonal patterns. Standard softmax attention entangles these through global normalization, while recent recurrent models sacrifice long-term, order-independent selection for order-dependent causal structure. CAPS combines SO(2) rotations for phase alignment with three additive gating paths -- Riemann softmax, prefix-product gates, and a Clock baseline -- within a single attention layer. We introduce the Clock mechanism, a learned temporal weighting that modulates these paths through a shared notion of temporal importance. Experiments on long- and short-term forecasting benchmarks surpass vanilla softmax and linear attention mechanisms and demonstrate competitive performance against seven strong baselines with linear complexity. Our code implementation is available at https://github.com/vireshpati/CAPS-Attention.</p></details> |  |
| **[Online conformal inference for multi-step time series forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13115v2)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider the problem of constructing distribution-free prediction intervals for multi-step time series forecasting, with a focus on the temporal dependencies inherent in multi-step forecast errors. We establish that the optimal $h$-step-ahead forecast errors exhibit serial correlation up to lag $(h-1)$ under a general non-stationary autoregressive data generating process. To leverage these properties, we propose the Autocorrelated Multi-step Conformal Prediction (AcMCP) method, which effectively incorporates autocorrelations in multi-step forecast errors, resulting in more statistically efficient prediction intervals. This method guarantees asymptotic marginal coverage for multi-step prediction intervals, though we note that, for finite samples, the coverage error admits an upper bound that increases with the forecasting horizon. Additionally, we extend several easy-to-implement conformal prediction methods, originally designed for single-step forecasting, to accommodate multi-step scenarios. Through empirical evaluations, including simulations and applications to data, we demonstrate that AcMCP achieves coverage that closely aligns with the target within local windows, while providing adaptive prediction intervals that effectively respond to varying conditions.</p></details> |  |

This work addresses frame forecasting in chest and liver cine MRI to compensate for such delays. We investigate RNNs trained with online learning algorithms, enabling adaptation to changing respiratory patterns via on-the-fly parameter updates, and transformers, increasingly common in time series forecasting for their ability to capture long-term dependencies. Experiments were conducted using 12 sagittal thoracic and upper-abdominal cine-MRI sequences from ETH Zürich and OvGU. PCA decomposes the Lucas-Kanade optical-flow field into static deformations and low-dimensional time-dependent weights. We compare various methods forecasting the latter: linear filters, population and sequence-specific encoder-only transformers, and RNNs trained with real-time recurrent learning (RTRL), unbiased online recurrent optimization, decoupled neural interfaces, and sparse one-step approximation (SnAp-1). Predicted displacements were used to warp the reference frame and generate future images. Prediction accuracy decreased with the horizon h. Linear regression performed best at short horizons (1.3mm geometrical error at h=0.32s, ETH Zürich data), while RTRL and SnAp-1 outperformed the other algorithms at medium-to-long horizons, with geometrical errors below 1.4mm and 2.8mm on the sequences from ETH Zürich and OvGU (the latter featuring higher motion variability, noise, and lower contrast), respectively. The sequence-specific transformer was competitive for low-to-medium horizons, but transformers remained overall limited by data scarcity and domain shift between datasets. Predicted frames visually resembled the ground truth, with notable errors occurring near the diaphragm at end-inspiration and regions affected by out-of-plane motion.</p></details> | <details><summary>43 pa...</summary><p>43 pages, 19 figures, revised version (including transformer experiments, evaluation on liver MRI data, statistical analysis...)</p></details> |
| **[To See Far, Look Close: Evolutionary Forecasting for Long-term Time Series](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23114v2)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The prevailing Direct Forecasting (DF) paradigm dominates Long-term Time Series Forecasting (LTSF) by forcing models to predict the entire future horizon in a single forward pass. While efficient, this rigid coupling of output and evaluation horizons necessitates computationally prohibitive re-training for every target horizon. In this work, we uncover a counter-intuitive optimization anomaly: models trained on short horizons-when coupled with our proposed Evolutionary Forecasting (EF) paradigm-significantly outperform those trained directly on long horizons. We attribute this success to the mitigation of a fundamental optimization pathology inherent in DF, where conflicting gradients from distant futures cripple the learning of local dynamics. We establish EF as a unified generative framework, proving that DF is merely a degenerate special case of EF. Extensive experiments demonstrate that a singular EF model surpasses task-specific DF ensembles across standard benchmarks and exhibits robust asymptotic stability in extreme extrapolation. This work propels a paradigm shift in LTSF: moving from passive Static Mapping to autonomous Evolutionary Reasoning.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Optimization Method for Autoregressive Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02288v1)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current time-series forecasting models are primarily based on transformer-style neural networks. These models achieve long-term forecasting mainly by scaling up the model size rather than through genuinely autoregressive (AR) rollout. From the perspective of large language model training, the traditional training process for time-series forecasting models ignores temporal causality. In this paper, we propose a novel training method for time-series forecasting that enforces two key properties: (1) AR prediction errors should increase with the forecasting horizon. Any violation of this principle is considered random guessing and is explicitly penalized in the loss function, and (2) the method enables models to concatenate short-term AR predictions for forming flexible long-term forecasts. Empirical results demonstrate that our method establishes a new state-of-the-art across multiple benchmarks, achieving an MSE reduction of more than 10% compared to iTransformer and other recent strong baselines. Furthermore, it enables short-horizon forecasting models to perform reliable long-term predictions at horizons over 7.5 times longer.

Traditional models often struggle with spatial generalization because they are trained or calibrated on limited observations and can degrade under concept drift. Recently proposed vision foundation models trained on satellite imagery demand massive compute, and they are not designed for dynamic land surface prediction tasks. We introduce StefaLand, a generative spatiotemporal Earth representation learning model centered on learning cross-domain interactions to suppress overfitting. StefaLand demonstrates especially strong spatial generalization on five datasets across four important tasks: streamflow, soil moisture, soil composition and landslides, compared to previous state-of-the-art methods. The domain-inspired design choices include a location-aware masked autoencoder that fuses static and time-series inputs, an attribute-based rather than image-based representation that drastically reduces compute demands, and residual fine-tuning adapters that strengthen knowledge transfer across tasks. StefaLand can be pretrained and finetuned on commonly available academic compute resources, yet consistently outperforms state-of-the-art supervised learning baselines, fine-tuned vision foundation models and commercially available embeddings, highlighting the previously overlooked value of cross-domain interactions and providing assistance to data-poor regions of the world.</p></details> |  |
| **[Interpretability in Deep Time Series Models Demands Semantic Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02239v1)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep time series models continue to improve predictive performance, yet their deployment remains limited by their black-box nature. In response, existing interpretability approaches in the field keep focusing on explaining the internal model computations, without addressing whether they align or not with how a human would reason about the studied phenomenon. Instead, we state interpretability in deep time series models should pursue semantic alignment: predictions should be expressed in terms of variables that are meaningful to the end user, mediated by spatial and temporal mechanisms that admit user-dependent constraints. In this paper, we formalize this requirement and require that, once established, semantic alignment must be preserved under temporal evolution: a constraint with no analog in static settings. Provided with this definition, we outline a blueprint for semantically aligned deep time series models, identify properties that support trust, and discuss implications for model design.</p></details> |  |
| **[Back to the Future: Look-ahead Augmentation and Parallel Self-Refinement for Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02146v1)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Long-term time series forecasting (LTSF) remains challenging due to the trade-off between parallel efficiency and sequential modeling of temporal coherence. Direct multi-step forecasting (DMS) methods enable fast, parallel prediction of all future horizons but often lose temporal consistency across steps, while iterative multi-step forecasting (IMS) preserves temporal dependencies at the cost of error accumulation and slow inference. To bridge this gap, we propose Back to the Future (BTTF), a simple yet effective framework that enhances forecasting stability through look-ahead augmentation and self-corrective refinement. Rather than relying on complex model architectures, BTTF revisits the fundamental forecasting process and refines a base model by ensembling the second-stage models augmented with their initial predictions. Despite its simplicity, our approach consistently improves long-horizon accuracy and mitigates the instability of linear forecasting models, achieving accuracy gains of up to 58% and demonstrating stable improvements even when the first-stage model is trained under suboptimal conditions. These results suggest that leveraging model-generated forecasts as augmentation can be a simple yet powerful way to enhance long-term prediction, even without complex architectures.</p></details> | <details><summary>4 pag...</summary><p>4 pages, Short paper accepted at The Web Conference (WWW) 2026</p></details> |
| **[A Semi-Supervised Pipeline for Generalized Behavior Discovery from Animal-Borne Motion Time Series](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02618v1)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning behavioral taxonomies from animal-borne sensors is challenging because labels are scarce, classes are highly imbalanced, and behaviors may be absent from the annotated set. We study generalized behavior discovery in short multivariate motion snippets from gulls, where each sample is a sequence with 3-axis IMU acceleration (20 Hz) and GPS speed, spanning nine expert-annotated behavior categories. We propose a semi-supervised discovery pipeline that (i) learns an embedding function from the labeled subset, (ii) performs label-guided clustering over embeddings of both labeled and unlabeled samples to form candidate behavior groups, and (iii) decides whether a discovered group is truly novel using a containment score. Our key contribution is a KDE + HDR (highest-density region) containment score that measures how much a discovered cluster distribution is contained within, or contains, each known-class distribution; the best-match containment score serves as an interpretable novelty statistic. In experiments where an entire behavior is withheld from supervision and appears only in the unlabeled pool, the method recovers a distinct cluster and the containment score flags novelty via low overlap, while a negative-control setting with no novel behavior yields consistently higher overlaps. These results suggest that HDR-based containment provides a practical, quantitative test for generalized class discovery in ecological motion time series under limited annotation and severe class imbalance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Robust Amortized Bayesian Inference with Self-Consistency Losses on Unlabeled Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13483v5)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Amortized Bayesian inference (ABI) with neural networks can solve probabilistic inverse problems orders of magnitude faster than classical methods. However, ABI is not yet sufficiently robust for widespread and safe application. When performing inference on observations outside the scope of the simulated training data, posterior approximations are likely to become highly biased, which cannot be corrected by additional simulations due to the bad pre-asymptotic behavior of current neural posterior estimators. In this paper, we propose a semi-supervised approach that enables training not only on labeled simulated data generated from the model, but also on \textit{unlabeled} data originating from any source, including real data. To achieve this, we leverage Bayesian self-consistency properties that can be transformed into strictly proper losses that do not require knowledge of ground-truth parameters. We test our approach on several real-world case studies, including applications to high-dimensional time-series and image data. Our results show that semi-supervised learning with unlabeled data drastically improves the robustness of ABI in the out-of-simulation regime. Notably, inference remains accurate even when evaluated on observations far away from the labeled and unlabeled data seen during training.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR) 2026</p></details> |
| **[T-LLM: Teaching Large Language Models to Forecast Time Series via Temporal Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01937v1)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting plays a critical role in decision-making across many real-world applications. Unlike data in vision and language domains, time series data is inherently tied to the evolution of underlying processes and can only accumulate as real-world time progresses, limiting the effectiveness of scale-driven pretraining alone. This time-bound constraint poses a challenge for enabling large language models (LLMs) to acquire forecasting capability, as existing approaches primarily rely on representation-level alignment or inference-time temporal modules rather than explicitly teaching forecasting behavior to the LLM. We propose T-LLM, a temporal distillation framework that equips general-purpose LLMs with time series forecasting capability by transferring predictive behavior from a lightweight temporal teacher during training. The teacher combines trend modeling and frequency-domain analysis to provide structured temporal supervision, and is removed entirely at inference, leaving the LLM as the sole forecasting model. Experiments on benchmark datasets and infectious disease forecasting tasks demonstrate that T-LLM consistently outperforms existing LLM-based forecasting methods under full-shot, few-shot, and zero-shot settings, while enabling a simple and efficient deployment pipeline.</p></details> |  |
| **[Environment-Conditioned Tail Reweighting for Total Variation Invariant Risk Minimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22944v2)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization remains challenging when models simultaneously encounter correlation shifts across environments and diversity shifts driven by rare or hard samples. Existing invariant risk minimization (IRM) methods primarily address spurious correlations at the environment level, but often overlook sample-level heterogeneity within environments, which can critically impact OOD performance. In this work, we propose Environment-Conditioned Tail Reweighting for Total Variation Invariant Risk Minimization (ECTR), a unified framework that augments TV-based invariant learning with environment-conditioned tail reweighting to jointly address both types of distribution shift. By integrating environment-level invariance with within-environment robustness, the proposed approach makes these two mechanisms complementary under mixed distribution shifts. We further extend the framework to scenarios without explicit environment annotations by inferring latent environments through a minimax formulation. Experiments across regression, tabular, time-series, and image classification benchmarks under mixed distribution shifts demonstrate consistent improvements in both worst-environment and average OOD performance.</p></details> | 8 pages |
| **[Designing Time Series Experiments in A/B Testing with Transformer Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01853v1)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A/B testing has become a gold standard for modern technological companies to conduct policy evaluation. Yet, its application to time series experiments, where policies are sequentially assigned over time, remains challenging. Existing designs suffer from two limitations: (i) they do not fully leverage the entire history for treatment allocation; (ii) they rely on strong assumptions to approximate the objective function (e.g., the mean squared error of the estimated treatment effect) for optimizing the design. We first establish an impossibility theorem showing that failure to condition on the full history leads to suboptimal designs, due to the dynamic dependencies in time series experiments. To address both limitations simultaneously, we next propose a transformer reinforcement learning (RL) approach which leverages transformers to condition allocation on the entire history and employs RL to directly optimize the MSE without relying on restrictive assumptions. Empirical evaluations on synthetic data, a publicly available dispatch simulator, and a real-world ridesharing dataset demonstrate that our proposal consistently outperforms existing designs.</p></details> |  |

Moreover, the shaprpy Python library brings the core capabilities of shapr to the Python ecosystem. Shapley values originate from cooperative game theory in the 1950s, but have over the past few years become a widely used method for quantifying how a model's features/covariates contribute to specific prediction outcomes. The shapr package emphasizes conditional Shapley value estimates, providing a comprehensive range of approaches for accurately capturing feature dependencies -- a crucial aspect for correct model explanation, typically lacking in similar software. In addition to regular tabular data, the shapr R package includes specialized functionality for explaining time series forecasts. The package offers a minimal set of user functions with sensible default values for most use cases while providing extensive flexibility for advanced users to fine-tune computations. Additional features include parallelized computations, iterative estimation with convergence detection, and rich visualization tools. shapr also extends its functionality to compute causal and asymmetric Shapley values when causal information is available. Overall, the shapr and shaprpy packages aim to enhance the interpretability of predictive models within a powerful and user-friendly framework.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatio-Temporal Transformers for Long-Term NDVI Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01799v1)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Long-term satellite image time series (SITS) analysis in heterogeneous landscapes faces significant challenges, particularly in Mediterranean regions where complex spatial patterns, seasonal variations, and multi-decade environmental changes interact across different scales. This paper presents the Spatio-Temporal Transformer for Long Term Forecasting (STT-LTF ), an extended framework that advances beyond purely temporal analysis to integrate spatial context modeling with temporal sequence prediction. STT-LTF processes multi-scale spatial patches alongside temporal sequences (up to 20 years) through a unified transformer architecture, capturing both local neighborhood relationships and regional climate influences. The framework employs comprehensive self-supervised learning with spatial masking, temporal masking, and horizon sampling strategies, enabling robust model training from 40 years of unlabeled Landsat imagery. Unlike autoregressive approaches, STT-LTF directly predicts arbitrary future time points without error accumulation, incorporating spatial patch embeddings, cyclical temporal encoding, and geographic coordinates to learn complex dependencies across heterogeneous Mediterranean ecosystems. Experimental evaluation on Landsat data (1984-2024) demonstrates that STT-LTF achieves a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.0328 and R^2 of 0.8412 for next-year predictions, outperforming traditional statistical methods, CNN-based approaches, LSTM networks, and standard transformers. The framework's ability to handle irregular temporal sampling and variable prediction horizons makes it particularly suitable for analysis of heterogeneous landscapes experiencing rapid ecological transitions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Position: Beyond Model-Centric Prediction -- Agentic Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01776v1)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting has traditionally been formulated as a model-centric, static, and single-pass prediction problem that maps historical observations to future values. While this paradigm has driven substantial progress, it proves insufficient in adaptive and multi-turn settings where forecasting requires informative feature extraction, reasoning-driven inference, iterative refinement, and continual adaptation over time. In this paper, we argue for agentic time series forecasting (ATSF), which reframes forecasting as an agentic process composed of perception, planning, action, reflection, and memory. Rather than focusing solely on predictive models, ATSF emphasizes organizing forecasting as an agentic workflow that can interact with tools, incorporate feedback from outcomes, and evolve through experience accumulation. We outline three representative implementation paradigms -- workflow-based design, agentic reinforcement learning, and a hybrid agentic workflow paradigm -- and discuss the opportunities and challenges that arise when shifting from model-centric prediction to agentic forecasting. Together, this position aims to establish agentic forecasting as a foundation for future research at the intersection of time series forecasting.</p></details> |  |

We summarize these concerns and analyze groundly their inherent limitations: i.e. the irreconcilable conflict between single (or few similar) domains SOTA and generalizability over general domains for time series forecasting neural network architecture designs. Moreover, neural networks architectures for general domain time series forecasting are becoming more and more complicated and their performance has almost saturated in recent years. As a result, network architectures developed aiming at fitting general time series domains are almost not inspiring for real world practices for certain single (or few similar) domains such as Finance, Weather, Traffic, etc: each specific domain develops their own methods that rarely utilize advances in neural network architectures of time series community in recent 2-3 years. As a result, we call for the time series community to shift focus away from research on time series neural network architectures for general domains: these researches have become saturated and away from domain-specific SOTAs over time. We should either (1) focus on deep learning methods for certain specific domain(s), or (2) turn to the development of meta-learning methods for general domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 3 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

We propose Forecasting Counterfactuals under Stochastic Dynamics (FOCUS), a method that extends traditional matrix completion methods by leveraging time series dynamics of the factors, thereby enhancing the prediction accuracy of future counterfactuals. Building upon a consistent estimator of the factors, our method accommodates both stochastic and deterministic components within the factors, and provides a flexible framework for various applications. In case of stationary autoregressive factors and under standard conditions, we derive error bounds and establish asymptotic normality of our estimator. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our method outperforms existing benchmarks when the latent factors have an autoregressive component. We illustrate FOCUS results on HeartSteps, a mobile health study, illustrating its effectiveness in forecasting step counts for users receiving activity prompts, thereby leveraging temporal patterns in user behavior.</p></details> | 39 pages, 10 figures |
| **[ASGMamba: Adaptive Spectral Gating Mamba for Multivariate Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01668v1)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Long-term multivariate time series forecasting (LTSF) plays a crucial role in various high-performance computing applications, including real-time energy grid management and large-scale traffic flow simulation. However, existing solutions face a dilemma: Transformer-based models suffer from quadratic complexity, limiting their scalability on long sequences, while linear State Space Models (SSMs) often struggle to distinguish valuable signals from high-frequency noise, leading to wasted state capacity. To bridge this gap, we propose ASGMamba, an efficient forecasting framework designed for resource-constrained supercomputing environments. ASGMamba integrates a lightweight Adaptive Spectral Gating (ASG) mechanism that dynamically filters noise based on local spectral energy, enabling the Mamba backbone to focus its state evolution on robust temporal dynamics. Furthermore, we introduce a hierarchical multi-scale architecture with variable-specific Node Embeddings to capture diverse physical characteristics. Extensive experiments on nine benchmarks demonstrate that ASGMamba achieves state-of-the-art accuracy. While keeping strictly $$\mathcal{O}(L)$$ complexity we significantly reduce the memory usage on long-horizon tasks, thus establishing ASGMamba as a scalable solution for high-throughput forecasting in resource limited environments.The code is available at https://github.com/hit636/ASGMamba</p></details> |  |
| **[Inference-time Stochastic Refinement of GRU-Normalizing Flow for Real-time Video Motion Transfer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04282v2)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-time video motion transfer applications such as immersive gaming and vision-based anomaly detection require accurate yet diverse future predictions to support realistic synthesis and robust downstream decision making under uncertainty. To improve the diversity of such sequential forecasts we propose a novel inference-time refinement technique that combines Gated Recurrent Unit-Normalizing Flows (GRU-NF) with stochastic sampling methods. While GRU-NF can capture multimodal distributions through its integration of normalizing flows within a temporal forecasting framework, its deterministic transformation structure can limit expressivity. To address this, inspired by Stochastic Normalizing Flows (SNF), we introduce Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) steps during GRU-NF inference, enabling the model to explore a richer output space and better approximate the true data distribution without retraining. We validate our approach in a keypoint-based video motion transfer pipeline, where capturing temporally coherent and perceptually diverse future trajectories is essential for realistic samples and low bandwidth communication. Experiments show that our inference framework, Gated Recurrent Unit- Stochastic Normalizing Flows (GRU-SNF) outperforms GRU-NF in generating diverse outputs without sacrificing accuracy, even under longer prediction horizons. By injecting stochasticity during inference, our approach captures multimodal behavior more effectively. These results highlight the potential of integrating stochastic dynamics with flow-based sequence models for generative time series forecasting.

Through large-scale evaluations on standard benchmarks, we find that leading transformer-based TSFMs exhibit redundant components in their intermediate layers. We introduce a set of tools for mechanistic interpretability of TSFMs, including ablations of specific components and direct logit attribution on the residual stream. Our findings are consistent across several leading TSFMs with diverse architectures, and across a diverse set of real-world and synthetic time-series datasets. We discover that all models in our study are robust to ablations of entire layers. Furthermore, we develop a theoretical framework framing transformers as kernel regressors, motivating a purely intrinsic strategy for ablating heads based on the stable rank of the per-head projection matrices. Using this approach, we uncover the specific heads responsible for degenerate phenomena widely observed in TSFMs, such as parroting of motifs from the context and seasonality bias. Our study sheds light on the universal properties of this emerging class of architectures for continuous-time sequence modeling.</p></details> |  |

However, instead of explicitly performing temporal interaction through self-attention, linear models implicitly perform it based on stacked MLP structures, which may be insufficient in capturing the complex temporal dependencies and their performance still has potential for improvement. To this end, we propose a Lightweight Sparse Interaction Network (LSINet) for TSF task. Inspired by the sparsity of self-attention, we propose a Multihead Sparse Interaction Mechanism (MSIM). Different from self-attention, MSIM learns the important connections between time steps through sparsity-induced Bernoulli distribution to capture temporal dependencies for TSF. The sparsity is ensured by the proposed self-adaptive regularization loss. Moreover, we observe the shareability of temporal interactions and propose to perform Shared Interaction Learning (SIL) for MSIM to further enhance efficiency and improve convergence. LSINet is a linear model comprising only MLP structures with low overhead and equipped with explicit temporal interaction mechanisms. Extensive experiments on public datasets show that LSINet achieves both higher accuracy and better efficiency than advanced linear models and transformer models in TSF tasks.

Existing approaches often treat engagement as a homogeneous time-series signal, overlooking the heterogeneous social mechanisms and platform designs that shape how misinformation spreads. In this work, we ask: ``Can neural architectures discover social exchange principles from behavioral data alone?'' We introduce \textsc{Dreams} (\underline{D}isentangled \underline{R}epresentations and \underline{E}pisodic \underline{A}daptive \underline{M}odeling for \underline{S}ocial media misinformation engagements), a social exchange theory-guided framework that models misinformation engagement as a dynamic process of social exchange. Rather than treating engagement as a static outcome, \textsc{Dreams} models it as a sequence-to-sequence adaptation problem, where each action reflects an evolving negotiation between user effort and social reward conditioned by platform context. It integrates adaptive mechanisms to learn how emotional and contextual signals propagate through time and across platforms. On a cross-platform dataset spanning $7$ platforms and 2.37M posts collected between 2021 and 2025, \textsc{Dreams} achieves state-of-the-art performance in predicting misinformation engagements, reaching a mean absolute percentage error of $19.25$\%. This is a $43.6$\% improvement over the strongest baseline. Beyond predictive gains, the model reveals consistent cross-platform patterns that align with social exchange principles, suggesting that integrating behavioral theory can enhance empirical modeling of online misinformation engagement.

| **[Beyond Model Ranking: Predictability-Aligned Evaluation for Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23074v2)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the era of increasingly complex AI models for time series forecasting, progress is often measured by marginal improvements on benchmark leaderboards. However, this approach suffers from a fundamental flaw: standard evaluation metrics conflate a model's performance with the data's intrinsic unpredictability. To address this pressing challenge, we introduce a novel, predictability-aligned diagnostic framework grounded in spectral coherence. Our framework makes two primary contributions: the Spectral Coherence Predictability (SCP), a computationally efficient ($O(N\log N)$) and task-aligned score that quantifies the inherent difficulty of a given forecasting instance, and the Linear Utilization Ratio (LUR), a frequency-resolved diagnostic tool that precisely measures how effectively a model exploits the linearly predictable information within the data. We validate our framework's effectiveness and leverage it to reveal two core insights. First, we provide the first systematic evidence of "predictability drift", demonstrating that a task's forecasting difficulty varies sharply over time. Second, our evaluation reveals a key architectural trade-off: complex models are superior for low-predictability data, whereas linear models are highly effective on more predictable tasks. We advocate for a paradigm shift, moving beyond simplistic aggregate scores toward a more insightful, predictability-aware evaluation that fosters fairer model comparisons and a deeper understanding of model behavior.</p></details> |  |

They term this convergence as NeuroAI. Previous research has established temporal neural networks (TNNs) as a promising neuromorphic approach toward biological intelligence and efficiency. We fully embrace NeuroAI and propose a new category of TNNs we call NeuroAI TNNs (NeuTNNs) with greater capability and hardware efficiency by adopting neuroscience findings, including a neuron model with active dendrites and a hierarchy of distal and proximal segments. This work introduces a PyTorch-to-layout tool suite (NeuTNNGen) to design application-specific NeuTNNs. Compared to previous TNN designs, NeuTNNs achieve superior performance and efficiency. We demonstrate NeuTNNGen's capabilities using three example applications: 1) UCR time series benchmarks, 2) MNIST design exploration, and 3) Place Cells design for neocortical reference frames. We also explore using synaptic pruning to further reduce synapse counts and hardware costs by 30-50% while maintaining model precision across diverse sensory modalities. NeuTNNGen can facilitate the design of application-specific energy-efficient NeuTNNs for the next generation of NeuroAI computing systems.</p></details> |  |

Recent work explores multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to enhance time series understanding with contextual information beyond numerical signals. This area has grown from 7 papers in 2023 to over 580 in 2025, yet existing methods struggle in real-world settings. We analyze 20 influential works from 2025 across model design, task formulation, and evaluation, and identify critical gaps: methods adapt NLP techniques with limited attention to core time series properties; tasks remain restricted to traditional prediction and classification; and evaluations emphasize benchmarks over robustness, interpretability, or decision relevance. We argue that achieving time series reasoning requires rethinking model design, task formulation, and evaluation together. We define time series reasoning, outline challenges and future directions, and call on researchers to develop unified frameworks for robust, interpretable, and decision-relevant reasoning in real-world applications.

Traditional methodologies often adapt univariate approaches or rely on assumptions specific to certain domains or problems, presenting limitations. A recent promising alternative is to map multivariate time series into high-level network structures such as multiplex networks, with past work relying on connecting successive time series components with interconnections between contemporary timestamps. In this work, we first define a novel cross-horizontal visibility mapping between lagged timestamps of different time series and then introduce the concept of multilayer horizontal visibility graphs. This allows describing cross-dimension dependencies via inter-layer edges, leveraging the entire structure of multilayer networks. To this end, a novel parameter-free topological measure is proposed and common measures are extended for the multilayer setting. Our approach is general and applicable to any kind of multivariate time series data. We provide an extensive experimental evaluation with both synthetic and real-world datasets. We first explore the proposed methodology and the data properties highlighted by each measure, showing that inter-layer edges based on cross-horizontal visibility preserve more information than previous mappings, while also complementing the information captured by commonly used intra-layer edges. We then illustrate the applicability and validity of our approach in multivariate time series mining tasks, showcasing its potential for enhanced data analysis and insights.</p></details> |  |

While Bayesian Optimization (BO) is a standard approach, it typically treats tuning tasks independently and provides limited insight into its decisions. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) offer new opportunities to incorporate structured prior knowledge and reasoning into optimization pipelines. We introduce LLM-AutoOpt, a hybrid HPO framework that combines BO with LLM-based contextual reasoning. The framework encodes dataset meta-features, model descriptions, historical optimization outcomes, and target objectives as structured meta-knowledge within LLM prompts, using BO to initialize the search and mitigate cold-start effects. This design enables context-aware and stable hyperparameter refinement while exposing the reasoning behind optimization decisions. Experiments on a multivariate time series forecasting benchmark demonstrate that LLM-AutoOpt achieves improved predictive performance and more interpretable optimization behavior compared to BO and LLM baselines without meta-knowledge.</p></details> |  |
| **[DCD: Decomposition-based Causal Discovery from Autocorrelated and Non-Stationary Temporal Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01433v1)** | 2026-02-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multivariate time series in domains such as finance, climate science, and healthcare often exhibit long-term trends, seasonal patterns, and short-term fluctuations, complicating causal inference under non-stationarity and autocorrelation. Existing causal discovery methods typically operate on raw observations, making them vulnerable to spurious edges and misattributed temporal dependencies. We introduce a decomposition-based causal discovery framework that separates each time series into trend, seasonal, and residual components and performs component-specific causal analysis. Trend components are assessed using stationarity tests, seasonal components using kernel-based dependence measures, and residual components using constraint-based causal discovery. The resulting component-level graphs are integrated into a unified multi-scale causal structure. This approach isolates long- and short-range causal effects, reduces spurious associations, and improves interpretability. Across extensive synthetic benchmarks and real-world climate data, our framework more accurately recovers ground-truth causal structure than state-of-the-art baselines, particularly under strong non-stationarity and temporal autocorrelation.</p></details> |  |
| **[PaAno: Patch-Based Representation Learning for Time-Series Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01359v1)** | 2026-02-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although recent studies on time-series anomaly detection have increasingly adopted ever-larger neural network architectures such as transformers and foundation models, they incur high computational costs and memory usage, making them impractical for real-time and resource-constrained scenarios. Moreover, they often fail to demonstrate significant performance gains over simpler methods under rigorous evaluation protocols. In this study, we propose Patch-based representation learning for time-series Anomaly detection (PaAno), a lightweight yet effective method for fast and efficient time-series anomaly detection. PaAno extracts short temporal patches from time-series training data and uses a 1D convolutional neural network to embed each patch into a vector representation. The model is trained using a combination of triplet loss and pretext loss to ensure the embeddings capture informative temporal patterns from input patches. During inference, the anomaly score at each time step is computed by comparing the embeddings of its surrounding patches to those of normal patches extracted from the training time-series. Evaluated on the TSB-AD benchmark, PaAno achieved state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming existing methods, including those based on heavy architectures, on both univariate and multivariate time-series anomaly detection across various range-wise and point-wise performance measures.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the 14th International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR 2026)</p></details> |
| **[The Procrustean Bed of Time Series: The Optimization Bias of Point-wise Loss](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18610v2)** | 2026-02-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Optimizing time series models via point-wise loss functions (e.g., MSE) relying on a heuristic point-wise i.i.d. assumption disregards the causal temporal structure. Focusing on the core independence issue under covariance stationarity, this paper aims to provide a first-principles analysis of the Expectation of Optimization Bias (EOB). Our analysis reveals a fundamental paradigm paradox: The more deterministic and structured the time series, the more severe the bias incurred by point-wise loss function. We derive the first closed-form quantification for the non-deterministic EOB across linear and non-linear systems, and prove EOB is an intrinsic data property, governed exclusively by sequence length and the defined Structural Signal-to-Noise Ratio. This theoretical discovery motivates our principled debiasing program that eliminates the bias through sequence length reduction and structural orthogonalization. We present a concrete solution via DFT or DWT, and propose a novel harmonized $\ell_p$ norm framework to rectify gradient optimization pathologies of high-variance sequences. Extensive experiments validate EOB Theory's generality and the superior performance of debiasing program, achieving 5.2% and 5.1% average improvement of MSE and MAE conducted on the iTransformer across 11 datasets, respectively.</p></details> | 54 pages |
| **[Semi-Supervised Model-Free Bayesian State Estimation from Compressed Measurements](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07368v7)** | 2026-02-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider data-driven Bayesian state estimation from compressed measurements (BSCM) of a model-free process. The dimension of the temporal measurement vector is lower than that of the temporal state vector to be estimated, leading to an under-determined inverse problem. The underlying dynamical model of the state's evolution is unknown for a 'model-free process.' Hence, it is difficult to use traditional model-driven methods, for example, Kalman and particle filters. Instead, we consider data-driven methods. We experimentally show that two existing unsupervised learning-based data-driven methods fail to address the BSCM problem in a model-free process. The methods are -- data-driven nonlinear state estimation (DANSE) and deep Markov model (DMM). While DANSE provides good predictive/forecasting performance to model the temporal measurement data as a time series, its unsupervised learning lacks suitable regularization for tackling the BSCM task. We then propose a semi-supervised learning approach and develop a semi-supervised learning-based DANSE method, referred to as SemiDANSE. In SemiDANSE, we use a large amount of unlabelled data along with a limited amount of labelled data, i.e., pairwise measurement-and-state data, which provides the desired regularization. Using benchmark chaotic dynamical systems, we empirically show that the data-driven SemiDANSE provides competitive state estimation performance for BSCM using a handful of different measurement systems, against a hybrid method called KalmanNet and two model-driven methods (extended Kalman filter and unscented Kalman filter) that know the dynamical models exactly.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 14 figures, under review in IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing</p></details> |
| **[Chronos: Learning Temporal Dynamics of Reasoning Chains for Test-Time Scaling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01208v1)** | 2026-02-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Test-Time Scaling (TTS) has emerged as an effective paradigm for improving the reasoning performance of large language models (LLMs). However, existing methods -- most notably majority voting and heuristic token-level scoring -- treat reasoning traces or tokens equally, thereby being susceptible to substantial variations in trajectory quality and localized logical failures. In this work, we introduce \textbf{Chronos}, a lightweight and plug-and-play chronological reasoning scorer that models each trajectory as a time series. Specifically, Chronos learns to capture trajectory features of token probabilities, assigns quality scores accordingly, and employs a weighted voting mechanism. Extensive evaluations on both in-domain and out-of-domain benchmarks demonstrate that Chronos consistently delivers substantial gains across a variety of models, with negligible computational overhead. Notably, Chronos@128 achieves relative improvements of 34.21\% over Pass@1 and 22.70\% over Maj@128 on HMMT25 using Qwen3-4B-Thinking-2507, highlighting its effectiveness.</p></details> |  |
| **[Analyzing and Improving Diffusion Models for Time-Series Data Imputation: A Proximal Recursion Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01182v1)** | 2026-02-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models (DMs) have shown promise for Time-Series Data Imputation (TSDI); however, their performance remains inconsistent in complex scenarios. We attribute this to two primary obstacles: (1) non-stationary temporal dynamics, which can bias the inference trajectory and lead to outlier-sensitive imputations; and (2) objective inconsistency, since imputation favors accurate pointwise recovery whereas DMs are inherently trained to generate diverse samples. To better understand these issues, we analyze DM-based TSDI process through a proximal-operator perspective and uncover that an implicit Wasserstein distance regularization inherent in the process hinders the model's ability to counteract non-stationarity and dissipative regularizer, thereby amplifying diversity at the expense of fidelity. Building on this insight, we propose a novel framework called SPIRIT (Semi-Proximal Transport Regularized time-series Imputation). Specifically, we introduce entropy-induced Bregman divergence to relax the mass preserving constraint in the Wasserstein distance, formulate the semi-proximal transport (SPT) discrepancy, and theoretically prove the robustness of SPT against non-stationarity. Subsequently, we remove the dissipative structure and derive the complete SPIRIT workflow, with SPT serving as the proximal operator. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed SPIRIT approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-Horizon Electricity Price Forecasting with Deep Learning in the Australian National Electricity Market](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01157v1)** | 2026-02-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate electricity price forecasting (EPF) is essential for operational planning, trading, and flexible asset scheduling in liberalised power systems, yet remains challenging due to volatility, heavy-tailed spikes, and frequent regime shifts. While deep learning (DL) has been increasingly adopted in EPF to capture complex and nonlinear price dynamics, several important gaps persist: (i) limited attention to multi-day horizons beyond day-ahead forecasting, (ii) insufficient exploration of state-of-the-art (SOTA) time series DL models, and (iii) a predominant reliance on aggregated horizon-level evaluation that obscures time-of-day forecasting variation. To address these gaps, we propose a novel EPF framework that extends the forecast horizon to multi-day-ahead by systematically building forecasting models that leverage benchmarked SOTA time series DL models. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation to analyse time-of-day forecasting performance by integrating model assessment at intraday interval levels across all five regions in the Australian National Electricity Market (NEM). The results show that no single model consistently dominates across regions, metrics, and horizons. Overall, standard DL models deliver superior performance in most regions, while SOTA time series DL models demonstrate greater robustness to forecast horizon extension. Intraday interval-level evaluation reveals pronounced diurnal error patterns, indicating that absolute errors peak during the evening ramp, relative errors inflate during midday negative-price regimes, and directional accuracy degrades during periods of frequent trend changes. These findings suggest that future research on DL-based EPF can benefit from enriched feature representations and modelling strategies that enhance longer-term forecasting robustness while maintaining sensitivity to intraday volatility and structural price dynamics.</p></details> | 63 Pages |
| **[Parallel Training in Spiking Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01133v1)** | 2026-02-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The bio-inspired integrate-fire-reset mechanism of spiking neurons constitutes the foundation for efficient processing in Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs). Recent progress in large models demands that spiking neurons support highly parallel computation to scale efficiently on modern GPUs. This work proposes a novel functional perspective that provides general guidance for designing parallel spiking neurons. We argue that the reset mechanism, which induces complex temporal dependencies and hinders parallel training, should be removed. However, any such modification should satisfy two principles: 1) preserving the functions of reset as a core biological mechanism; and 2) enabling parallel training without sacrificing the serial inference ability of spiking neurons, which underpins their efficiency at test time. To this end, we identify the functions of the reset and analyze how to reconcile parallel training with serial inference, upon which we propose a dynamic decay spiking neuron. We conduct comprehensive testing of our method in terms of: 1) Training efficiency and extrapolation capability. On 16k-length sequences, we achieve a 25.6x training speedup over the pioneering parallel spiking neuron, and our models trained on 2k-length can stably perform inference on sequences as long as 30k. 2) Generality. We demonstrate the consistent effectiveness of the proposed method across five task categories (image classification, neuromorphic event processing, time-series forecasting, language modeling, and reinforcement learning), three network architectures (spiking CNN/Transformer/SSMs), and two spike activation modes (spike/integer activation). 3) Energy consumption. The spiking firing of our neuron is lower than that of vanilla and existing parallel spiking neurons.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learnable Koopman-Enhanced Transformer-Based Time Series Forecasting with Spectral Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02592v1)** | 2026-02-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper proposes a unified family of learnable Koopman operator parameterizations that integrate linear dynamical systems theory with modern deep learning forecasting architectures. We introduce four learnable Koopman variants-scalar-gated, per-mode gated, MLP-shaped spectral mapping, and low-rank Koopman operators which generalize and interpolate between strictly stable Koopman operators and unconstrained linear latent dynamics. Our formulation enables explicit control over the spectrum, stability, and rank of the linear transition operator while retaining compatibility with expressive nonlinear backbones such as Patchtst, Autoformer, and Informer. We evaluate the proposed operators in a large-scale benchmark that also includes LSTM, DLinear, and simple diagonal State-Space Models (SSMs), as well as lightweight transformer variants. Experiments across multiple horizons and patch lengths show that learnable Koopman models provide a favorable bias-variance trade-off, improved conditioning, and more interpretable latent dynamics. We provide a full spectral analysis, including eigenvalue trajectories, stability envelopes, and learned spectral distributions. Our results demonstrate that learnable Koopman operators are effective, stable, and theoretically principled components for deep forecasting.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Knowable Future: Mapping the Decay of Past-Future Mutual Information Across Forecast Horizons](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10006v3)** | 2026-02-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In many social, business, economic, and physical systems, the true data generating process (DGP) is unknown and forecasters must therefore work with the observed time series. We propose a pre-modelling diagnostic framework that assesses horizon-specific forecastability before model selection begins, helping decide when additional modelling effort is likely to pay off. We operationalise forecastability as auto-mutual information (AMI) at lag h, measuring how much the past reduces uncertainty about future values. Using a k-nearest-neighbour estimator computed on training data only, we validate AMI against realised out-of-sample error (sMAPE) across 1,350 M4 series spanning six frequencies, using Seasonal Naive, ETS, and N-BEATS as probe models under a rolling-origin protocol. The central finding is that the AMI-sMAPE relationship is strongly frequency-conditional. For Hourly, Weekly, Quarterly, and Yearly series, AMI shows consistent negative rank association with realised error (Spearman rho from -0.52 to -0.66 for higher-capacity probes), supporting its use as a triage signal; Monthly shows moderate association, while Daily exhibits weaker discrimination despite measurable dependence. Across all frequencies, median forecast error decreases monotonically from low to high AMI terciles, confirming decision-relevant separation. These results establish AMI as a practical screening tool for identifying when sophisticated modelling is warranted, when simple baselines are likely to suffice, and when attention should shift from accuracy improvement to robust decision design. These results support the use of horizon-specific forecastability diagnostics to guide modelling effort and resource allocation in organisational forecasting settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages with 5 figures</p></details> |

Given the complexity of physical constraints, two challenges stand out. $(i)$ Physics-computation scalability: physics-informed learning can enforce physical regularization, but its computation (e.g., ODE integration) does not scale to extensive systems. $(ii)$ Knowledge-sharing efficiency: the attention mechanism is primarily computed within each system, which limits the extraction of shared ODE structures across systems. We show that enforcing ODE consistency does not require expensive nonlinear integration: a token-wise locally linear ODE representation preserves physical fidelity while scaling to foundation-model regimes. Thus, we propose novel token representations that respect locally linear ODE evolution. Such linearity substantially accelerates integration while accurately approximating the local data manifold. Second, we introduce a simple yet effective inter-system attention that augments attention with a common structure hub (CSH) that stores shared tokens and aggregates knowledge across systems. The resulting model, termed LASS-ODE (\underline{LA}rge-\underline{S}cale \underline{S}mall \underline{ODE}), is pretrained on our $40$GB ODE trajectory collections to enable strong in-domain performance, zero-shot generalization across diverse ODE systems, and additional improvements through fine-tuning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Early Classification of Time Series in Non-Stationary Cost Regimes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00918v1)** | 2026-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Early Classification of Time Series (ECTS) addresses decision-making problems in which predictions must be made as early as possible while maintaining high accuracy. Most existing ECTS methods assume that the time-dependent decision costs governing the learning objective are known, fixed, and correctly specified. In practice, however, these costs are often uncertain and may change over time, leading to mismatches between training-time and deployment-time objectives. In this paper, we study ECTS under two practically relevant forms of cost non-stationarity: drift in the balance between misclassification and decision delay costs, and stochastic realizations of decision costs that deviate from the nominal training-time model. To address these challenges, we revisit representative ECTS approaches and adapt them to an online learning setting. Focusing on separable methods, we update only the triggering model during deployment, while keeping the classifier fixed. We propose several online adaptations and baselines, including bandit-based and RL-based approaches, and conduct controlled experiments on synthetic data to systematically evaluate robustness under cost non-stationarity. Our results demonstrate that online learning can effectively improve the robustness of ECTS methods to cost drift, with RL-based strategies exhibiting strong and stable performance across varying cost regimes.</p></details> |  |

Without structured oversight, such changes can degrade model behavior, increase operational cost, and reduce the usefulness of deployed systems. Although Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) streamlines the lifecycle of ML models, it provides limited support for addressing runtime uncertainties that influence the longer term sustainability of MLS. To support continued viability, these systems need a mechanism that detects when execution drifts outside acceptable bounds and adjusts system behavior in response. Despite the growing interest in sustainable and self-adaptive MLS, there has been limited work towards exemplars that allow researchers to study these challenges in MLOps pipelines. This paper presents Harmonica, a self-adaptation exemplar built on the HarmonE approach, designed to enable the sustainable operation of such pipelines. Harmonica introduces structured adaptive control through MAPE-K loop, separating high-level adaptation policy from low-level tactic execution. It continuously monitors sustainability metrics, evaluates them against dynamic adaptation boundaries, and automatically triggers architectural tactics when thresholds are violated. We demonstrate the tool through case studies in time series regression and computer vision, examining its ability to improve system stability and reduce manual intervention. The results show that Harmonica offers a practical and reusable foundation for enabling adaptive behavior in MLS that rely on MLOps pipelines for sustained operation.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted to SEAMS 2026 Artifact Track</p></details> |

RMFlow approximates the average velocity of the flow path using a neural network trained with a new loss function that balances minimizing the Wasserstein distance between probability paths and maximizing sample likelihood.

Standard methods that minimize reconstruction error or encourage distributional alignment risk overfitting these biased observations. We propose the Distributionally Robust Regularized Imputer Objective (DRIO), which jointly minimizes reconstruction error and the divergence between the imputer and a worst-case distribution within a Wasserstein ambiguity set. We derive a tractable dual formulation that reduces infinite-dimensional optimization over measures to adversarial search over sample trajectories, and propose an adversarial learning algorithm compatible with flexible deep learning backbones. Comprehensive experiments on diverse real-world datasets show DRIO consistently improves imputation under both missing-completely-at-random and missing-not-at-random settings, reaching Pareto-optimal trade-offs between reconstruction accuracy and distributional alignment.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dynamic causal inference with time series data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00836v1)** | 2026-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We generalize the potential outcome framework to time series with an intervention by defining causal effects on stochastic processes. Interventions in dynamic systems alter not only outcome levels but also evolutionary dynamics -- changing persistence and transition laws. Our framework treats potential outcomes as entire trajectories, enabling causal estimands, identification conditions, and estimators to be formulated directly on path space. The resulting Dynamic Average Treatment Effect (DATE) characterizes how causal effects evolve through time and reduces to the classical average treatment effect under one period of time. For observational data, we derive a dynamic inverse-probability weighting estimator that is unbiased under dynamic ignorability and positivity. When treated units are scarce, we show that conditional mean trajectories underlying the DATE admit a linear state-space representation, yielding a dynamic linear model implementation. Simulations demonstrate that modeling time as intrinsic to the causal mechanism exposes dynamic effects that static methods systematically misestimate. An empirical study of COVID-19 lockdowns illustrates the framework's practical value for estimating and decomposing treatment effects.</p></details> |  |

Although the NPP-VIIRS sensor provides high-quality NTL observations, its temporal coverage, which begins in 2012, restricts long-term time-series studies that extend to earlier periods. Current extended VIIRS-like NTL data products suffer from two significant shortcomings: the underestimation of light intensity and the omission of structural details. To overcome these limitations, we present the Extended VIIRS-like Artificial Nighttime Light (EVAL) dataset, a new annual NTL dataset for China spanning from 1986 to 2024. This dataset was generated using a novel two-stage deep learning model designed to address the aforementioned shortcomings. The model first constructs an initial estimate and subsequently refines fine-grained structural details using high-resolution impervious surface data as guidance. Quantitative evaluations demonstrate that EVAL significantly outperforms state-of-the-art products, exhibiting superior temporal consistency and a stronger correlation with socioeconomic indicators.</p></details> |  |
| **[True Zero-Shot Inference of Dynamical Systems Preserving Long-Term Statistics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13192v3)** | 2026-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Complex, temporally evolving phenomena, from climate to brain activity, are governed by dynamical systems (DS). DS reconstruction (DSR) seeks to infer generative surrogate models of these from observed data, reproducing their long-term behavior. Existing DSR approaches require purpose-training for any new system observed, lacking the zero-shot and in-context inference capabilities known from LLMs. Here we introduce DynaMix, a novel multivariate ALRNN-based mixture-of-experts architecture pre-trained for DSR, the first DSR model able to generalize zero-shot to out-of-domain DS. Just from a provided context signal, without any re-training, DynaMix faithfully forecasts the long-term evolution of novel DS where existing time series (TS) foundation models, like Chronos, fail -- at a fraction of the number of parameters (0.1%) and orders of magnitude faster inference times. DynaMix outperforms TS foundation models in terms of long-term statistics, and often also short-term forecasts, even on real-world time series, like traffic or weather data, typically used for training and evaluating TS models, but not at all part of DynaMix' training corpus. We illustrate some of the failure modes of TS models for DSR problems, and conclude that models built on DS principles may bear a huge potential also for advancing the TS prediction field.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hybrid Artificial-Living Cell Collectives for Wetware Computing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00787v1)** | 2026-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Living systems continuously sense, integrate, and act on chemical information using multiscale biochemical networks whose dynamics are inherently nonlinear, adaptive, and energy-efficient. Yet, most attempts to harness such "wetware" for external computational tasks have centered on neural tissue and electrical interfaces, leaving the information-processing potential of non-neural collectives comparatively underexplored. In this letter, we study a hybrid artificial-living cell network in which programmable artificial cells write time-varying inputs into a biochemical microenvironment, while a living bacterial collective provides the nonlinear spatiotemporal dynamics required for temporal information processing. Specifically, artificial cells transduce an external input sequence into the controlled secretion of attractant and repellent molecules, thereby modulating the "local biochemical context" that bacteria naturally sense and respond to. The resulting collective bacterial dynamics, together with the evolving molecular fields, form a high-dimensional reservoir state that is sampled coarsely (voxel-wise) and mapped to outputs through a trained linear readout within a physical reservoir computing framework. Using an agent-based in silico model, we evaluate the proposed hybrid reservoir on the Mackey-Glass chaotic time-series prediction benchmark. The system achieves normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) values of approximately 0.33-0.40 for prediction horizons H=1 to 5, and exhibits measurable short-term memory as encoded in the distributed spatiotemporal patterns of bacteria and biochemicals. These results motivate the future exploration of non-neural hybrid cell networks for in situ temporal signal processing towards novel biomedical applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Stable Time Series Prediction of Enterprise Carbon Emissions Based on Causal Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00775v1)** | 2026-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Against the backdrop of ongoing carbon peaking and carbon neutrality goals, accurate prediction of enterprise carbon emission trends constitutes an essential foundation for energy structure optimization and low-carbon transformation decision-making. Nevertheless, significant heterogeneity persists across regions, industries and individual enterprises regarding energy structure, production scale, policy intensity and governance efficacy, resulting in pronounced distribution shifts and non-stationarity in carbon emission data across both temporal and spatial dimensions. Such cross-regional and cross-enterprise data drift not only compromises the accuracy of carbon emission reporting but substantially undermines the guidance value of predictive models for production planning and carbon quota trading decisions. To address this critical challenge, we integrate causal inference perspectives with stable learning methodologies and time-series modelling, proposing a stable temporal prediction mechanism tailored to distribution shift environments. This mechanism incorporates enterprise-level energy inputs, capital investment, labour deployment, carbon pricing, governmental interventions and policy implementation intensity, constructing a risk consistency-constrained stable learning framework that extracts causal stable features (robust against external perturbations yet demonstrating long-term stable effects on carbon dioxide emissions) from multi-environment samples across diverse policies, regions and industrial sectors. Furthermore, through adaptive normalization and sample reweighting strategies, the approach dynamically rectifies temporal non-stationarity induced by economic fluctuations and policy transitions, ultimately enhancing model generalization capability and explainability in complex environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Aurora: Towards Universal Generative Multimodal Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22295v3)** | 2026-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cross-domain generalization is very important in Time Series Forecasting because similar historical information may lead to distinct future trends due to the domain-specific characteristics. Recent works focus on building unimodal time series foundation models and end-to-end multimodal supervised models. Since domain-specific knowledge is often contained in modalities like texts, the former lacks the explicit utilization of them, thus hindering the performance. The latter is tailored for end-to-end scenarios and does not support zero-shot inference for cross-domain scenarios. In this work, we introduce Aurora, a Multimodal Time Series Foundation Model, which supports multimodal inputs and zero-shot inference. Pretrained on Corss-domain Multimodal Time Series Corpus, Aurora can adaptively extract and focus on key domain knowledge contained in corrsponding text or image modalities, thus possessing strong Cross-domain generalization capability. Through tokenization, encoding, and distillation, Aurora can extract multimodal domain knowledge as guidance and then utilizes a Modality-Guided Multi-head Self-Attention to inject them into the modeling of temporal representations. In the decoding phase, the multimodal representations are used to generate the conditions and prototypes of future tokens, contributing to a novel Prototype-Guided Flow Matching for generative probabilistic forecasting. Comprehensive experiments on 5 well-recognized benchmarks, including TimeMMD, TSFM-Bench, ProbTS, TFB, and EPF, demonstrate the consistent state-of-the-art performance of Aurora on both unimodal and multimodal scenarios.</p></details> |  |

Firstly, the basic information and transaction data of popular NFTs on the Solana chain are collected using the Selenium tool. Secondly, the transaction records of the Magic Eden trading market are thoroughly analyzed by combining them with the Scrapy framework to examine the price fluctuations and market trends of NFTs. In terms of data analysis, this paper employs time series analysis to examine the dynamics of the NFT market and seeks to identify potential price patterns. In addition, the risk and return of different NFTs are evaluated using the mean-variance optimization model, taking into account their characteristics, such as illiquidity and market volatility, to provide investors with data-driven portfolio recommendations. The experimental results show that the combination of crawler technology and financial analytics can effectively analyze NFT data on the Solana blockchain and provide timely market insights and investment strategies. This study provides a reference for further exploration in the field of digital currencies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deep Time-series Forecasting Needs Kernelized Moment Balancing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00717v1)** | 2026-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep time-series forecasting can be formulated as a distribution balancing problem aimed at aligning the distribution of the forecasts and ground truths. According to Imbens' criterion, true distribution balance requires matching the first moments with respect to any balancing function. We demonstrate that existing objectives fail to meet this criterion, as they enforce moment matching only for one or two predefined balancing functions, thus failing to achieve full distribution balance. To address this limitation, we propose direct forecasting with kernelized moment balancing (KMB-DF). Unlike existing objectives, KMB-DF adaptively selects the most informative balancing functions from a reproducing kernel hilbert space (RKHS) to enforce sufficient distribution balancing. We derive a tractable and differentiable objective that enables efficient estimation from empirical samples and seamless integration into gradient-based training pipelines. Extensive experiments across multiple models and datasets show that KMB-DF consistently improves forecasting accuracy and achieves state-of-the-art performance. Code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/KMB-DF-403C.</p></details> |  |

We revisit this paradigm and show that a simple linear autoregressive anomaly score with the closed-form solution provided by ordinary least squares (OLS) regression consistently matches or outperforms state-of-the-art deep detectors. From a theoretical perspective, we show that linear models capture a broad class of anomaly types, estimating a finite-history Gaussian process conditional density. From a practical side, across extensive univariate and multivariate benchmarks, the proposed approach achieves superior accuracy while requiring orders of magnitude fewer computational resources. Thus, future research should consistently include strong linear baselines and, more importantly, develop new benchmarks with richer temporal structures pinpointing the advantages of deep learning models.</p></details> |  |
| **[PHAT: Modeling Period Heterogeneity for Multivariate Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00654v1)** | 2026-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While existing multivariate time series forecasting models have advanced significantly in modeling periodicity, they largely neglect the periodic heterogeneity common in real-world data, where variates exhibit distinct and dynamically changing periods. To effectively capture this periodic heterogeneity, we propose PHAT (Period Heterogeneity-Aware Transformer). Specifically, PHAT arranges multivariate inputs into a three-dimensional "periodic bucket" tensor, where the dimensions correspond to variate group characteristics with similar periodicity, time steps aligned by phase, and offsets within the period. By restricting interactions within buckets and masking cross-bucket connections, PHAT effectively avoids interference from inconsistent periods. We also propose a positive-negative attention mechanism, which captures periodic dependencies from two perspectives: periodic alignment and periodic deviation. Additionally, the periodic alignment attention scores are decomposed into positive and negative components, with a modulation term encoding periodic priors. This modulation constrains the attention mechanism to more faithfully reflect the underlying periodic trends. A mathematical explanation is provided to support this property. We evaluate PHAT comprehensively on 14 real-world datasets against 18 baselines, and the results show that it significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving highly competitive forecasting performance.

The existing LTSF paradigms follow a three-stage pipeline of embedding, backbone refinement, and long-horizon prediction. However, the behaviors of individual backbone layers remain underexplored. We introduce layer sensitivity, a gradient-based metric inspired by GradCAM and effective receptive field theory, which quantifies both positive and negative contributions of each time point to a layer's latent features. Applying this metric to a three-layer MLP backbone reveals depth-specific specialization in modeling temporal dynamics in the input sequence. Motivated by these insights, we propose MoDEx, a lightweight Mixture of Depth-specific Experts, which replaces complex backbones with depth-specific MLP experts. MoDEx achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on seven real-world benchmarks, ranking first in 78 percent of cases, while using significantly fewer parameters and computational resources. It also integrates seamlessly into transformer variants, consistently boosting their performance and demonstrating robust generalizability as an efficient and high-performance LTSF framework.</p></details> |  |

However, this practice violates the training-free premise of zero-shot deployment and introduces evaluation bias due to classifier-dependent training choices. To address this issue, we propose TIC-FM, an in-context learning framework that treats the labeled training set as context and predicts labels for all test instances in a single forward pass, without parameter updates. TIC-FM pairs a time series encoder and a lightweight projection adapter with a split-masked latent memory Transformer. We further provide theoretical justification that in-context inference can subsume trained classifiers and can emulate gradient-based classifier training within a single forward pass. Experiments on 128 UCR datasets show strong accuracy, with consistent gains in the extreme low-label situation, highlighting training-free transfer</p></details> |  |

Patching techniques, commonly used and effective in time series modeling, help capture temporal dependencies by dividing the data into patches. However, existing patch-based methods fail to dynamically select patches and typically use all patches during the prediction process. In real-world time series, there are often low-quality issues during data collection, such as missing values, distribution shifts, anomalies and white noise, which may cause some patches to contain low-quality information, negatively impacting the prediction results. To address this issue, this study proposes a robust time series forecasting framework called SEER. Firstly, we propose an Augmented Embedding Module, which improves patch-wise representations using a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture and obtains series-wise token representations through a channel-adaptive perception mechanism. Secondly, we introduce a Learnable Patch Replacement Module, which enhances forecasting robustness and model accuracy through a two-stage process: 1) a dynamic filtering mechanism eliminates negative patch-wise tokens; 2) a replaced attention module substitutes the identified low-quality patches with global series-wise token, further refining their representations through a causal attention mechanism. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate the SOTA performance of SEER.</p></details> |  |

These irregularities violate the equidistant assumptions of standard models, hindering local temporal modeling and rendering classical frequency-domain methods ineffective for capturing global periodic structures. To address this challenge, we propose TFMixer, a joint time-frequency modeling framework for IMTS forecasting. Specifically, TFMixer incorporates a Global Frequency Module that employs a learnable Non-Uniform Discrete Fourier Transform (NUDFT) to directly extract spectral representations from irregular timestamps. In parallel, the Local Time Module introduces a query-based patch mixing mechanism to adaptively aggregate informative temporal patches and alleviate information density imbalance. Finally, TFMixer fuses the time-domain and frequency-domain representations to generate forecasts and further leverages inverse NUDFT for explicit seasonal extrapolation. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the state--of-the-art performance of TFMixer.</p></details> |  |
| **[Global Feature Enhancing and Fusion Framework for Strain Gauge Time Series Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11629v2)** | 2026-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Strain Gauge Status (SGS) time series recognition is crucial in the field of intelligent manufacturing based on the Internet of Things, as accurate identification helps timely detection of failed mechanical components, avoiding accidents. The loading and unloading sequences generated by strain gauges can be identified through time series classification (TSC) algorithms. Recently, deep learning models, e.g., convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown remarkable success in the TSC task, as they can extract discriminative local features from the subsequences to identify the time series. However, we observe that only the local features may not be sufficient for expressing the time series, especially when the local sub-sequences between different time series are very similar, e.g., SGS data of aircraft wings in static strength experiments. Nevertheless, CNNs suffer from the limitation in extracting global features due to the nature of convolution operations. For extracting global features to more comprehensively represent the SGS time series, we propose two insights: (i) Constructing global features through feature engineering. (ii) Learning high-order relationships between local features to capture global features. To realize and utilize them, we propose a hypergraph-based global feature learning and fusion framework, which learns and fuses global features for semantic consistency to enhance the representation of SGS time series, thereby improving recognition accuracy. Our method designs are validated on industrial SGS and public UCR datasets, showing better generalization for unseen data in SGS recognition.

| **[Multi-period Learning for Financial Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08622v2)** | 2026-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting is important in finance domain. Financial time series (TS) patterns are influenced by both short-term public opinions and medium-/long-term policy and market trends. Hence, processing multi-period inputs becomes crucial for accurate financial time series forecasting (TSF). However, current TSF models either use only single-period input, or lack customized designs for addressing multi-period characteristics. In this paper, we propose a Multi-period Learning Framework (MLF) to enhance financial TSF performance. MLF considers both TSF's accuracy and efficiency requirements. Specifically, we design three new modules to better integrate the multi-period inputs for improving accuracy: (i) Inter-period Redundancy Filtering (IRF), that removes the information redundancy between periods for accurate self-attention modeling, (ii) Learnable Weighted-average Integration (LWI), that effectively integrates multi-period forecasts, (iii) Multi-period self-Adaptive Patching (MAP), that mitigates the bias towards certain periods by setting the same number of patches across all periods. Furthermore, we propose a Patch Squeeze module to reduce the number of patches in self-attention modeling for maximized efficiency. MLF incorporates multiple inputs with varying lengths (periods) to achieve better accuracy and reduces the costs of selecting input lengths during training.

Compared to relying solely on endogenous variables (i.e., target variables), considering exogenous variables (i.e., covariates) provides additional predictive information and often leads to more accurate predictions. However, existing methods for time series forecasting with exogenous variables (TSF-X) have the following shortcomings: 1) they do not leverage future exogenous variables, 2) they fail to fully account for the correlation between endogenous and exogenous variables. In this study, to better leverage exogenous variables, especially future exogenous variables, we propose DAG, which utilizes Dual correlAtion network along both the temporal and channel dimensions for time series forecasting with exoGenous variables. Specifically, we propose two core components: the Temporal Correlation Module and the Channel Correlation Module. Both modules consist of a correlation discovery submodule and a correlation injection submodule. The former is designed to capture the correlation effects of historical exogenous variables on future exogenous variables and on historical endogenous variables, respectively. The latter injects the discovered correlation relationships into the processes of forecasting future endogenous variables based on historical endogenous variables and future exogenous variables.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exact Gibbs sampling for stochastic differential equations with gradient drift and constant diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00512v1)** | 2026-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Stochastic differential equations (SDEs) are an important class of time-series models, used to describe stochastic systems evolving in continuous time. Simulating paths from these processes, particularly after conditioning on noisy observations of the latent path, remains a challenge. Existing methods often introduce bias through time-discretization, require involved rejection sampling or debiasing schemes or are restricted to a narrow family of diffusions. In this work, we propose an exact Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling algorithm that is applicable to a broad subset of all SDEs with unit diffusion coefficient; after suitable transformation, this includes an even larger class of multivariate SDEs and most 1-d SDEs. We develop a Gibbs sampling framework that allows exact MCMC for such diffusions, without any discretization error. We demonstrate how our MCMC methodology requires only fairly straightforward simulation steps. Our framework can be extended to include parameter simulation, and allows tools from the Gaussian process literature to be easily applied. We evaluate our method on synthetic and real datasets, demonstrating superior performance to particle MCMC approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Main ...</summary><p>Main document: 18 pages, 4 figures.

| **[AverageTime: Enhance Long-Term Time Series Forecasting with Simple Averaging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20727v4)** | 2026-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multivariate long-term time series forecasting aims to predict future sequences by utilizing historical observations, with a core focus on modeling intra-sequence and cross-channel dependencies. Numerous studies have developed diverse architectures to capture these patterns, achieving significant improvements in forecasting accuracy. Among them, iTransformer, a representative method for channel information extraction, leverages the Transformer architecture to model channel-wise dependencies, thereby facilitating sequence transformation for enhanced forecasting performance. Building upon iTransformer's channel extraction concept, we propose AverageTime, a simple, efficient, and scalable forecasting model. Beyond iTransformer, AverageTime retains the original sequence information and reframes channel extraction as a stackable and extensible architecture. This allows the model to generate multiple novel sequences through various structural mechanisms, rather than being limited to transforming the original input. Moreover, the newly extracted sequences are not restricted to channel processing; other techniques such as series decomposition can also be incorporated to enhance predictive accuracy. Additionally, we introduce a channel clustering technique into AverageTime, which substantially improves training and inference efficiency with negligible performance loss. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that with only two straightforward averaging operations, applied to both the extracted sequences and the original series. AverageTime surpasses state-of-the-art models in forecasting performance while maintaining near-linear complexity. This work offers a new perspective on time series forecasting: enriching sequence information through extraction and fusion.

| **[TRACE: Grounding Time Series in Context for Multimodal Embedding and Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09114v3)** | 2026-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The ubiquity of dynamic data in domains such as weather, healthcare, and energy underscores a growing need for effective interpretation and retrieval of time-series data. These data are inherently tied to domain-specific contexts, such as clinical notes or weather narratives, making cross-modal retrieval essential not only for downstream tasks but also for developing robust time-series foundation models by retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). Despite the increasing demand, time-series retrieval remains largely underexplored. Existing methods often lack semantic grounding, struggle to align heterogeneous modalities, and have limited capacity for handling multi-channel signals. To address this gap, we propose TRACE, a generic multimodal retriever that grounds time-series embeddings in aligned textual context. TRACE enables fine-grained channel-level alignment and employs hard negative mining to facilitate semantically meaningful retrieval. It supports flexible cross-modal retrieval modes, including Text-to-Timeseries and Timeseries-to-Text, effectively linking linguistic descriptions with complex temporal patterns. By retrieving semantically relevant pairs, TRACE enriches downstream models with informative context, leading to improved predictive accuracy and interpretability. Beyond a static retrieval engine, TRACE also serves as a powerful standalone encoder, with lightweight task-specific tuning that refines context-aware representations while maintaining strong cross-modal alignment. These representations achieve state-of-the-art performance on downstream forecasting and classification tasks. Extensive experiments across multiple domains highlight its dual utility, as both an effective encoder for downstream applications and a general-purpose retriever to enhance time-series models.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Observations to States: Latent Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00297v1)** | 2026-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning has achieved strong performance in Time Series Forecasting (TSF). However, we identify a critical representation paradox, termed Latent Chaos: models with accurate predictions often learn latent representations that are temporally disordered and lack continuity. We attribute this phenomenon to the dominant observation-space forecasting paradigm. Most TSF models minimize point-wise errors on noisy and partially observed data, which encourages shortcut solutions instead of the recovery of underlying system dynamics. To address this issue, we propose Latent Time Series Forecasting (LatentTSF), a novel paradigm that shifts TSF from observation regression to latent state prediction. Specifically, LatentTSF employs an AutoEncoder to project observations at each time step into a higher-dimensional latent state space. This expanded representation aims to capture underlying system variables and impose a smoother temporal structure. Forecasting is then performed entirely in the latent space, allowing the model to focus on learning structured temporal dynamics. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that our proposed latent objectives implicitly maximize mutual information between predicted latent states and ground-truth states and observations. Extensive experiments on widely-used benchmarks confirm that LatentTSF effectively mitigates latent chaos, achieving superior performance. Our code is available in https://github.com/Muyiiiii/LatentTSF.</p></details> |  |
| **[Revisiting Multivariate Time Series Forecasting with Missing Values](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23494v3)** | 2026-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Missing values are common in real-world time series, and multivariate time series forecasting with missing values (MTSF-M) has become a crucial area of research for ensuring reliable predictions. To address the challenge of missing data, current approaches have developed an imputation-then-prediction framework that uses imputation modules to fill in missing values, followed by forecasting on the imputed data. However, this framework overlooks a critical issue: there is no ground truth for the missing values, making the imputation process susceptible to errors that can degrade prediction accuracy. In this paper, we conduct a systematic empirical study and reveal that imputation without direct supervision can corrupt the underlying data distribution and actively degrade prediction accuracy. To address this, we propose a paradigm shift that moves away from imputation and directly predicts from the partially observed time series. We introduce Consistency-Regularized Information Bottleneck (CRIB), a novel framework built on the Information Bottleneck principle. CRIB combines a unified-variate attention mechanism with a consistency regularization scheme to learn robust representations that filter out noise introduced by missing values while preserving essential predictive signals. Comprehensive experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of CRIB, which predicts accurately even under high missing rates. Our code is available in https://github.com/Muyiiiii/CRIB.</p></details> |  |

We propose \emph{WaveLSFormer}, a learnable wavelet-based long-short Transformer that jointly performs multi-scale decomposition and return-oriented decision learning. Specifically, a learnable wavelet front-end generates low-/high-frequency components via an end-to-end trained filter bank, guided by spectral regularizers that encourage stable and well-separated frequency bands. To fuse multi-scale information, we introduce a low-guided high-frequency injection (LGHI) module that refines low-frequency representations with high-frequency cues while controlling training stability. The model outputs a portfolio of long/short positions that is rescaled to satisfy a fixed risk budget and is optimized directly with a trading objective and risk-aware regularization. Extensive experiments on five years of hourly data across six industry groups, evaluated over ten random seeds, demonstrate that WaveLSFormer consistently outperforms MLP, LSTM and Transformer backbones, with and without fixed discrete wavelet front-ends. On average in all industries, WaveLSFormer achieves a cumulative overall strategy return of $0.607 \pm 0.045$ and a Sharpe ratio of $2.157 \pm 0.166$, substantially improving both profitability and risk-adjusted returns over the strongest baselines.</p></details> |  |

Two types of techniques are commonly used to reduce the number of parameters - regularization and dimension reduction. In this project, we combine them by imposing a sparse factor structure and propose a regularized estimator to further reduce the number of parameters in factor models. A challenge limiting the widespread application of factor models is that factors are hard to interpret, as both factors and the loading matrix are unobserved. To address this, we introduce a penalty term when estimating the loading matrix for a sparse estimate. As a result, each factor only drives a smaller subset of time series that exhibit the strongest correlation, improving the factor interpretability. The theoretical properties of the proposed estimator are investigated. The simulation results are presented to confirm that our algorithm performs well. We apply our method to Hawaii tourism data.</p></details> |  |

Real-world trajectory data frequently exhibit heterogeneity across subjects such as patients, sites, and subpopulations, yet many traditional methods are not designed to accommodate such heterogeneity in data analysis. To address this, we propose a unified framework, termed Functional Singular Value Decomposition (FSVD), for statistical learning with heterogeneous trajectories. We establish the theoretical foundations of FSVD and develop a corresponding estimation algorithm that accommodates noisy and irregular observations. We further adapt FSVD to a wide range of trajectory-learning tasks, including dimension reduction, factor modeling, regression, clustering, and data completion, while preserving its ability to account for heterogeneity, leverage inherent smoothness, and handle irregular sampling. Through extensive simulations, we demonstrate that FSVD-based methods consistently outperform existing approaches across these tasks. Finally, we apply FSVD to a COVID-19 case-count dataset and electronic health record datasets, showcasing its effective performance in global and subgroup pattern discovery and factor analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>Journ...</summary><p>Journal of the American Statistical Association, to appear</p></details> |

However, constructing such data at scale remains challenging due to two key requirements: \textbf{\emph{Executability}}, since each instance requires a suitable and often distinct Docker environment; and \textbf{\emph{Verifiability}}, because heterogeneous task outputs preclude unified, standardized verification. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{TerminalTraj}, a scalable pipeline that (i) filters high-quality repositories to construct Dockerized execution environments, (ii) generates Docker-aligned task instances, and (iii) synthesizes agent trajectories with executable validation code. Using TerminalTraj, we curate 32K Docker images and generate 50,733 verified terminal trajectories across eight domains. Models trained on this data with the Qwen2.5-Coder backbone achieve consistent performance improvements on TerminalBench (TB), with gains of up to 20\% on TB~1.0 and 10\% on TB~2.0 over their respective backbones. Notably, \textbf{TerminalTraj-32B} achieves strong performance among models with fewer than 100B parameters, reaching 35.30\% on TB~1.0 and 22.00\% on TB~2.0, and demonstrates improved test-time scaling behavior.

The optimization performance largely depends on the quality of initial trajectories. However, the selection of a high-quality initial trajectory is non-trivial and requires a considerable time budget due to the extremely large space of the solution trajectories and the lack of prior knowledge about task constraints in configuration space. To alleviate the issue, we present a learning-based initial trajectory generation method that generates high-quality initial trajectories in a short time budget by adopting example-guided reinforcement learning. In addition, we suggest a null-space projected imitation reward to consider null-space constraints by efficiently learning kinematically feasible motion captured in expert demonstrations. Our statistical evaluation in simulation shows the improved optimality, efficiency, and applicability of TO when we plug in our method's output, compared with three other baselines. We also show the performance improvement and feasibility via real-world experiments with a seven-degree-of-freedom manipulator.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICRA 2023. <a href="https://sgvr.kaist.ac.kr/~msyoon/papers/ICRA23_RLITG/" rel="external noopener nofollow" class="link-external link-https">Project Page</a></p></details> |

However, current benchmarks are impeded by a notable scarcity of scenarios featuring dense traffic, which is essential for understanding and modeling complex interactions among road users. To address this gap, we collaborated with our industrial partner, DeepScenario, to develop DeepUrban-a new drone dataset designed to enhance trajectory prediction and planning benchmarks focusing on dense urban settings. DeepUrban provides a rich collection of 3D traffic objects, extracted from high-resolution images captured over urban intersections at approximately 100 meters altitude. The dataset is further enriched with comprehensive map and scene information to support advanced modeling and simulation tasks. We evaluate state-of-the-art (SOTA) prediction and planning methods, and conducted experiments on generalization capabilities. Our findings demonstrate that adding DeepUrban to nuScenes can boost the accuracy of vehicle predictions and planning, achieving improvements up to 44.1 % / 44.3% on the ADE / FDE metrics.

The current approaches focus on reinforcement learning (RL) and generative models. These efforts imitate offline historical behaviors by utilizing a complex structure with expensive hyperparameter tuning. The suboptimal trajectories further exacerbate the difficulty of policy learning. To address these challenges, we proposes QGA, a novel Q-value regularized Generative Auto-bidding method. In QGA, we propose to plug a Q-value regularization with double Q-learning strategy into the Decision Transformer backbone. This design enables joint optimization of policy imitation and action-value maximization, allowing the learned bidding policy to both leverage experience from the dataset and alleviate the adverse impact of the suboptimal trajectories. Furthermore, to safely explore the policy space beyond the data distribution, we propose a Q-value guided dual-exploration mechanism, in which the DT model is conditioned on multiple return-to-go targets and locally perturbed actions. This entire exploration process is dynamically guided by the aforementioned Q-value module, which provides principled evaluation for each candidate action. Experiments on public benchmarks and simulation environments demonstrate that QGA consistently achieves superior or highly competitive results compared to existing alternatives.

| **[Beyond Quantity: Trajectory Diversity Scaling for Code Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03219v1)** | 2026-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As code large language models (LLMs) evolve into tool-interactive agents via the Model Context Protocol (MCP), their generalization is increasingly limited by low-quality synthetic data and the diminishing returns of quantity scaling. Moreover, quantity-centric scaling exhibits an early bottleneck that underutilizes trajectory data. We propose TDScaling, a Trajectory Diversity Scaling-based data synthesis framework for code agents that scales performance through diversity rather than raw volume. Under a fixed training budget, increasing trajectory diversity yields larger gains than adding more trajectories, improving the performance-cost trade-off for agent training. TDScaling integrates four innovations: (1) a Business Cluster mechanism that captures real-service logical dependencies; (2) a blueprint-driven multi-agent paradigm that enforces trajectory coherence; (3) an adaptive evolution mechanism that steers synthesis toward long-tail scenarios using Domain Entropy, Reasoning Mode Entropy, and Cumulative Action Complexity to prevent mode collapse; and (4) a sandboxed code tool that mitigates catastrophic forgetting of intrinsic coding capabilities. Experiments on general tool-use benchmarks (BFCL, tau^2-Bench) and code agent tasks (RebenchT, CodeCI, BIRD) demonstrate a win-win outcome: TDScaling improves both tool-use generalization and inherent coding proficiency. We plan to release the full codebase and the synthesized dataset (including 30,000+ tool clusters) upon publication.</p></details> |  |

However, the high collection costs and ever-increasing privacy concerns prevent us from accessing large-scale LBSN trajectory data. The recent advances in synthetic data generation provide us with a new opportunity to achieve this, which utilizes generative AI to generate synthetic data that preserves the characteristics of real data while ensuring privacy protection. However, generating synthetic LBSN check-in trajectories remains challenging due to their spatially discrete, temporally irregular nature and the complex spatio-temporal patterns caused by sparse activities and uncertain human mobility. To address this challenge, we propose GeoGen, a two-stage coarse-to-fine framework for large-scale LBSN check-in trajectory generation. In the first stage, we reconstruct spatially continuous, temporally regular latent movement sequences from the original LBSN check-in trajectories and then design a Sparsity-aware Spatio-temporal Diffusion model (S$^2$TDiff) with an efficient denosing network to learn their underlying behavioral patterns. In the second stage, we design Coarse2FineNet, a Transformer-based Seq2Seq architecture equipped with a dynamic context fusion mechanism in the encoder and a multi-task hybrid-head decoder, which generates fine-grained LBSN trajectories based on coarse-grained latent movement sequences by modeling semantic relevance and behavioral uncertainty. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets show that GeoGen excels state-of-the-art models for both fidelity and utility evaluation, e.g., it increases over 69% and 55% in distance and radius metrics on the FS-TKY dataset.</p></details> |  |
| **[TMS: Trajectory-Mixed Supervision for Reward-Free, On-Policy SFT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03073v1)** | 2026-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) are the two dominant paradigms for enhancing Large Language Model (LLM) performance on downstream tasks. While RL generally preserves broader model capabilities (retention) better than SFT, it comes with significant costs: complex reward engineering, instability, and expensive on-policy sampling. In contrast, SFT is efficient but brittle, often suffering from catastrophic forgetting due to $\textbf{Supervision Mismatch}$: the divergence between the model's evolving policy and static training labels. We address this trade-off with $\textbf{Trajectory-Mixed Supervision (TMS)}$, a reward-free framework that approximates the on-policy benefits of RL by creating a dynamic curriculum from the model's own historical checkpoints. TMS minimizes $\textit{Policy-Label Divergence (PLD)}$, preventing the mode collapse that drives forgetting in standard SFT. Experiments across reasoning (MATH, GSM8K) and instruction-following benchmarks demonstrate that TMS effectively shifts the accuracy--retention Pareto frontier. While RL remains the gold standard for retention, TMS significantly outperforms standard and iterative SFT, bridging the gap to RL without requiring reward models or verifiers.

Maintaining safe operation under impairment to achieve task completion, i.e. fail-active operation, is our target. Focusing on actuation failures, we introduce DEFT, a diffusion-based trajectory generator conditioned on the robot's current embodiment and task constraints. DEFT generalizes across failure types, supports constrained and unconstrained motions, and enables task completion under arbitrary failure. We evaluated DEFT in both simulation and real-world scenarios using a 7-DoF robotic arm. In simulation over thousands of joint-failure cases across multiple tasks, DEFT outperformed the baseline by up to 2 times. On failures unseen during training, it continued to outperform the baseline, indicating robust generalization in simulation. Further, we performed real-world evaluations on two multi-step tasks, drawer manipulation and whiteboard erasing. These experiments demonstrated DEFT succeeding on tasks where classical methods failed. Our results show that DEFT achieves fail-active manipulation across arbitrary failure configurations and real-world deployments.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be published in the 2026 IEEE International Conference on Robotics & Automation</p></details> |

This linear design makes it difficult to revisit earlier states, branch into alternative search directions, or maintain global awareness under long contexts, often leading to local optima, redundant exploration, and inefficient search. We propose Re-TRAC, an agentic framework that performs cross-trajectory exploration by generating a structured state representation after each trajectory to summarize evidence, uncertainties, failures, and future plans, and conditioning subsequent trajectories on this state representation. This enables iterative reflection and globally informed planning, reframing research as a progressive process. Empirical results show that Re-TRAC consistently outperforms ReAct by 15-20% on BrowseComp with frontier LLMs. For smaller models, we introduce Re-TRAC-aware supervised fine-tuning, achieving state-of-the-art performance at comparable scales. Notably, Re-TRAC shows a monotonic reduction in tool calls and token usage across rounds, indicating progressively targeted exploration driven by cross-trajectory reflection rather than redundant search.</p></details> |  |
| **[Which Reasoning Trajectories Teach Students to Reason Better? A Simple Metric of Informative Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14249v2)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Long chain-of-thought (CoT) trajectories provide rich supervision signals for distilling reasoning from teacher to student LLMs. However, both prior work and our experiments show that trajectories from stronger teachers do not necessarily yield better students, highlighting the importance of data-student suitability in distillation. Existing methods assess suitability primarily through student likelihood, favoring trajectories that align closely with the student model's current behavior but overlooking more informative ones. Addressing this, we propose Rank-Surprisal Ratio (RSR), a simple metric that captures both alignment and informativeness to assess the suitability of a reasoning trajectory. RSR is motivated by the observation that effective trajectories typically balance learning signal strength and behavioral alignment by combining low absolute probability with relatively high-ranked tokens under the student model. Concretely, RSR is defined as the ratio of a trajectory's average token-wise rank to its average negative log-likelihood, and is straightforward to compute and interpret. Across five student models and reasoning trajectories from 11 diverse teachers, RSR strongly correlates with post-training reasoning performance (average Spearman 0.86), consistently outperforming existing metrics. We further demonstrate its practical utility in both trajectory selection and teacher selection.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages.

| **[AgentRx: Diagnosing AI Agent Failures from Execution Trajectories](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02475v1)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>AI agents often fail in ways that are difficult to localize because executions are probabilistic, long-horizon, multi-agent, and mediated by noisy tool outputs. We address this gap by manually annotating failed agent runs and release a novel benchmark of 115 failed trajectories spanning structured API workflows, incident management, and open-ended web/file tasks. Each trajectory is annotated with a critical failure step and a category from a grounded-theory derived, cross-domain failure taxonomy. To mitigate the human cost of failure attribution, we present AGENTRX, an automated domain-agnostic diagnostic framework that pinpoints the critical failure step in a failed agent trajectory. It synthesizes constraints, evaluates them step-by-step, and produces an auditable validation log of constraint violations with associated evidence; an LLM-based judge uses this log to localize the critical step and category. Our framework improves step localization and failure attribution over existing baselines across three domains.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Latent Signals to Reflection Behavior: Tracing Meta-Cognitive Activation Trajectory in R1-Style LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01999v1)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>R1-style LLMs have attracted growing attention for their capacity for self-reflection, yet the internal mechanisms underlying such behavior remain unclear. To bridge this gap, we anchor on the onset of reflection behavior and trace its layer-wise activation trajectory. Using the logit lens to read out token-level semantics, we uncover a structured progression: (i) Latent-control layers, where an approximate linear direction encodes the semantics of thinking budget; (ii) Semantic-pivot layers, where discourse-level cues, including turning-point and summarization cues, surface and dominate the probability mass; and (iii) Behavior-overt layers, where the likelihood of reflection-behavior tokens begins to rise until they become highly likely to be sampled. Moreover, our targeted interventions uncover a causal chain across these stages: prompt-level semantics modulate the projection of activations along latent-control directions, thereby inducing competition between turning-point and summarization cues in semantic-pivot layers, which in turn regulates the sampling likelihood of reflection-behavior tokens in behavior-overt layers. Collectively, our findings suggest a human-like meta-cognitive process-progressing from latent monitoring, to discourse-level regulation, and to finally overt self-reflection.

| **[Reusing Trajectories in Policy Gradients Enables Fast Convergence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06178v2)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Policy gradient (PG) methods are a class of effective reinforcement learning algorithms, particularly when dealing with continuous control problems. They rely on fresh on-policy data, making them sample-inefficient and requiring $O(ε^{-2})$ trajectories to reach an $ε$-approximate stationary point. A common strategy to improve efficiency is to reuse information from past iterations, such as previous gradients or trajectories, leading to off-policy PG methods. While gradient reuse has received substantial attention, leading to improved rates up to $O(ε^{-3/2})$, the reuse of past trajectories, although intuitive, remains largely unexplored from a theoretical perspective. In this work, we provide the first rigorous theoretical evidence that reusing past off-policy trajectories can significantly accelerate PG convergence. We propose RT-PG (Reusing Trajectories - Policy Gradient), a novel algorithm that leverages a power mean-corrected multiple importance weighting estimator to effectively combine on-policy and off-policy data coming from the most recent $ω$ iterations. Through a novel analysis, we prove that RT-PG achieves a sample complexity of $\widetilde{O}(ε^{-2}ω^{-1})$. When reusing all available past trajectories, this leads to a rate of $\widetilde{O}(ε^{-1})$, the best known one in the literature for PG methods. We further validate our approach empirically, demonstrating its effectiveness against baselines with state-of-the-art rates.</p></details> |  |

However, existing approaches predominantly rely on inversion-reconstruction trajectories, which impose an inherent trade-off: longer trajectories accumulate errors and compromise fidelity, while shorter ones fail to ensure sufficient alignment with the edit prompt. Previous attempts to address this issue typically employ backbone-specific feature manipulations, limiting general applicability. To address these challenges, we propose FlowBypass, a novel and analytical framework grounded in Rectified Flow that constructs a bypass directly connecting inversion and reconstruction trajectories, thereby mitigating error accumulation without relying on feature manipulations. We provide a formal derivation of two trajectories, from which we obtain an approximate bypass formulation and its numerical solution, enabling seamless trajectory transitions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FlowBypass consistently outperforms state-of-the-art image editing methods, achieving stronger prompt alignment while preserving high-fidelity details in irrelevant regions.</p></details> |  |

The majority of existing placement campaigns either follow standard `space-filling' designs or relatively ad-hoc expert opinions. A key challenge to applying principled active learning in this setting is that Lagrangian observers are continuously advected through the vector field, so they make measurements at different locations and times. It is, therefore, important to consider the likely future trajectories of placed observers to account for the utility of candidate placement locations. To this end, we present BALLAST: Bayesian Active Learning with Look-ahead Amendment for Sea-drifter Trajectories. We observe noticeable benefits of BALLAST-aided sequential observer placement strategies on both synthetic and high-fidelity ocean current models. In addition, we developed a novel GP inference method -- the Vanilla SPDE Exchange (VaSE) -- to boost the GP posterior sampling efficiency, which is also of independent interest.</p></details> |  |
| **[R-Stitch: Dynamic Trajectory Stitching for Efficient Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17307v5)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Chain-of-thought (CoT) enhances the problem-solving ability of large language models (LLMs) but incurs substantial inference cost due to long autoregressive trajectories. Existing acceleration strategies either shorten traces via early stopping or compression, or adopt speculative decoding with a smaller model. However, speculative decoding provides limited gains when model agreement is low and rigidly enforces token-level consistency, overlooking the observation that some smaller models, when correct, produce significantly more concise reasoning traces that could reduce inference length. We introduce R-Stitch, a training-free hybrid decoding framework that leverages token-level entropy as an uncertainty proxy to delegate computation between a small language model (SLM) and an LLM. Our analysis shows that high-entropy tokens are more likely to induce errors, motivating an entropy-guided routing strategy that lets the SLM efficiently handle low-entropy tokens while delegating uncertain ones to the LLM, thereby avoiding full rollbacks and preserving answer quality. We further extend this design with R-Stitch$^{+}$, which learns an adaptive routing policy to adjust the token budget dynamically beyond fixed thresholds. By jointly reducing per-token decoding complexity and the number of generated tokens, our method achieves substantial acceleration with negligible accuracy loss. Concretely, it attains peak speedups of 3.00$\times$ on DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B, 3.85$\times$ on 14B, and 4.10$\times$ on QWQ-32B while maintaining accuracy comparable to full LLM decoding. Moreover, it naturally enables adaptive efficiency--accuracy trade-offs that can be tailored to diverse computational budgets without retraining.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mitigating loss of control in advanced AI systems through instrumental goal trajectories](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01699v1)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Researchers at artificial intelligence labs and universities are concerned that highly capable artificial intelligence (AI) systems may erode human control by pursuing instrumental goals. Existing mitigations remain largely technical and system-centric: tracking capability in advanced systems, shaping behaviour through methods such as reinforcement learning from human feedback, and designing systems to be corrigible and interruptible. Here we develop instrumental goal trajectories to expand these options beyond the model. Gaining capability typically depends on access to additional technical resources, such as compute, storage, data and adjacent services, which in turn requires access to monetary resources. In organisations, these resources can be obtained through three organisational pathways. We label these pathways the procurement, governance and finance instrumental goal trajectories (IGTs). Each IGT produces a trail of organisational artefacts that can be monitored and used as intervention points when a systems capabilities or behaviour exceed acceptable thresholds. In this way, IGTs offer concrete avenues for defining capability levels and for broadening how corrigibility and interruptibility are implemented, shifting attention from model properties alone to the organisational systems that enable them.</p></details> |  |

Segmentation-oriented industrial anomaly synthesis (SIAS) has emerged as a promising alternative; however, existing methods struggle to balance sampling efficiency and generation quality. Moreover, most approaches treat all spatial regions uniformly, overlooking the distinct statistical differences between anomaly and background areas. This uniform treatment hinders the synthesis of controllable, structure-specific anomalies tailored for segmentation tasks. In this paper, we propose FAST, a foreground-aware diffusion framework featuring two novel modules: the Anomaly-Informed Accelerated Sampling (AIAS) and the Foreground-Aware Reconstruction Module (FARM). AIAS is a training-free sampling algorithm specifically designed for segmentation-oriented industrial anomaly synthesis, which accelerates the reverse process through coarse-to-fine aggregation and enables the synthesis of state-of-the-art segmentation-oriented anomalies in as few as 10 steps. Meanwhile, FARM adaptively adjusts the anomaly-aware noise within the masked foreground regions at each sampling step, preserving localized anomaly signals throughout the denoising trajectory. Extensive experiments on multiple industrial benchmarks demonstrate that FAST consistently outperforms existing anomaly synthesis methods in downstream segmentation tasks. We release the code at: https://github.com/Chhro123/fast-foreground-aware-anomaly-synthesis.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

Because both mechanisms can yield identical task success on the original interface, benchmark scores alone are not identifiable evidence of environment-invariant capability. We propose PIPE, a protocol-level evaluation augmentation for diagnosing interface reliance by minimally rewriting environment interfaces while preserving task semantics and execution behavior. Across 16 environments from AgentBench and AgentGym and a range of open-source and API-based agents, PIPE reveals that trajectory-SFT substantially amplifies interface shortcutting: trained agents degrade sharply under minimal interface rewrites, while non-trajectory-trained models remain largely stable. We further introduce Interface Reliance (IR), a counterbalanced alias-based metric that quantifies preference for training-time interfaces, and show that interface shortcutting exhibits environment-dependent, non-monotonic training dynamics that remain invisible under standard evaluation. Our code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/What-Do-Agents-Learn-from-Trajectory-SFT-Semantics-or-Interfaces--0831/.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we propose an efficient controller for trajectory tracking of marine vehicles under unknown disturbances by combining a convex error-state MPC on the Lie group augmented by an online learning module to compensate for these disturbances in real time. This design enables adaptive and robust tracking control while maintaining computational efficiency. Extensive evaluations in the Virtual RobotX (VRX) simulator, and real-world field experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior tracking accuracy under various disturbance scenarios compared with existing approaches.</p></details> |  |

It combines the exploratory capacity of conditional variational autoencoders (CVAEs) to generate trajectories and the semantic segmentation capabilities of a lightweight visual language model (VLM) to select the trajectory to execute. Open-vocabulary segmentation is used to score and select the generated trajectories based on natural language, and a state-of-the-art local planner executes velocity commands. One of the key features of the proposed approach is its ability to generate a large variability of trajectories and to select them and navigate in real-time. The approach was validated through real-world outdoor navigation experiments, achieving superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

This paper proposes a fully data-driven, graph-based framework for blind floor separation using only Wi-Fi fingerprint trajectories, without requiring prior building information or knowledge of the number of floors. In the proposed method, Wi-Fi fingerprints are represented as nodes in a trajectory graph, where edges capture both signal similarity and sequential movement context. Structural node embeddings are learned via Node2Vec, and floor-level partitions are obtained using K-Means clustering with automatic cluster number estimation. The framework is evaluated on multiple publicly available datasets, including a newly released Huawei University Challenge 2021 dataset and a restructured version of the UJIIndoorLoc benchmark. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach effectively captures the intrinsic vertical structure of multistory buildings using only received signal strength data. By eliminating dependence on building-specific metadata, the proposed method provides a scalable and practical solution for vertical localization in indoor environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages,4 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

Many existing distribution-matching approaches struggle in this regime because they impose strict support constraints and rely on brittle one-step models, making it hard to extract useful signal from imperfect data. To tackle this challenge, we propose TGE, a trajectory-level generative embedding for offline LfO that constructs a dense, smooth surrogate reward by estimating expert state density in the latent space of a temporal diffusion model trained on offline trajectory data. By leveraging the smooth geometry of the learned diffusion embedding, TGE captures long-horizon temporal dynamics and effectively bridges the gap between disjoint supports, ensuring a robust learning signal even when offline data is distributionally distinct from the expert. Empirically, the proposed approach consistently matches or outperforms prior offline LfO methods across a range of D4RL locomotion and manipulation benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 6 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |

However, their prohibitively slow inference due to a large number of denoising steps limits their potential use in real-time or interactive applications. Existing acceleration methods, like distillation, truncation, or consistency training, either degrade quality, incur costly retraining, or lack generalization. We propose FlowCast, a training-free speculative generation framework that accelerates inference by exploiting the fact that FM models are trained to preserve constant velocity. FlowCast speculates future velocity by extrapolating current velocity without incurring additional time cost, and accepts it if it is within a mean-squared error threshold. This constant-velocity forecasting allows redundant steps in stable regions to be aggressively skipped while retaining precision in complex ones. FlowCast is a plug-and-play framework that integrates seamlessly with any FM model and requires no auxiliary networks. We also present a theoretical analysis and bound the worst-case deviation between speculative and full FM trajectories. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that FlowCast achieves $>2.5\times$ speedup in image generation, video generation, and editing tasks, outperforming existing baselines with no quality loss as compared to standard full generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR 2026)</p></details> |

Our approach leverages a 4-dimensional spatio-temporal planner, integrated with vision-based Safe Flight Corridor (SFC) generation and trajectory optimization. Unlike prior methods that rely on map fusion, our framework is mapless, enabling collision avoidance directly from perception while reducing computational overhead. Dynamic obstacles are detected and tracked using a vision-based object segmentation and tracking pipeline, allowing robust classification of static versus dynamic elements in the scene. To further enhance robustness, we introduce a backup planning module that reactively avoids dynamic obstacles when no direct path to the goal is available, mitigating the risk of collisions during deadlock situations. We validate our method extensively in both simulation and real-world hardware experiments, and benchmark it against state-of-the-art approaches, showing significant advantages for reactive UAV navigation in dynamic, unknown environments.</p></details> |  |

Recent generative models promise end-to-end synthesis, but their reliance on unstructured noise priors often yields unsafe, inefficient, or unimodal plans that cannot meet real-time requirements. We propose StepNav, a novel framework that bridges this gap by introducing structured, multimodal trajectory priors derived from variational principles. StepNav first learns a geometry-aware success probability field to identify all feasible navigation corridors. These corridors are then used to construct an explicit, multi-modal mixture prior that initializes a conditional flow-matching process. This refinement is formulated as an optimal control problem with explicit smoothness and safety regularization. By replacing unstructured noise with physically-grounded candidates, StepNav generates safer and more efficient plans in significantly fewer steps. Experiments in both simulation and real-world benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements in robustness, efficiency, and safety over state-of-the-art generative planners, advancing reliable trajectory generation for practical autonomous navigation.

Inspired by the success of RL in language models, there is growing interest in further improving the models by alignment with a certain reward. In this work, we propose an offline preference optimization method to approach trajectory alignment for discrete diffusion models. Instead of applying the reward on the final output and backpropagating the gradient to the entire denoising process, we decompose the problem into a set of stepwise alignment objectives by matching the per-step posterior. This framework enables efficient diffusion optimization, is compatible with arbitrary reward functions, and importantly, yields an equivalent optimal solution under additive factorization of the trajectory reward. Experiments across multiple domains including DNA sequence design, protein inverse folding, and language modeling consistently demonstrate the superiority of our approach. Notably, it achieves an up to 12\% improvement over the most competitive RL-based baseline in terms of predicted activity on DNA sequence design, and further improves the GSM8K score from 78.6 to 81.2 on LLaDA-8B-Instruct for language modeling.</p></details> | ICLR 2026 |

Since molecular property evaluation often relies on costly and rate-limited oracles, such as experimental assays, molecular optimization must be highly sample-efficient. To address this, we introduce SEISMO, an LLM agent that performs strictly online, inference-time molecular optimization, updating after every oracle call without the need for population-based or batched learning. SEISMO conditions each proposal on the full optimization trajectory, combining natural-language task descriptions with scalar scores and, when available, structured explanatory feedback. Across the Practical Molecular Optimization benchmark of 23 tasks, SEISMO achieves a 2-3 times higher area under the optimisation curve than prior methods, often reaching near-maximal task scores within 50 oracle calls. Our additional medicinal-chemistry tasks show that providing explanatory feedback further improves efficiency, demonstrating that leveraging domain knowledge and structured information is key to sample-efficient molecular optimization.</p></details> | <details><summary>Fabia...</summary><p>Fabian P.

Traditional methods, focusing on simplistic spatio-temporal features, face challenges of complex calculations, limited scalability, and inadequate adaptability to real-world complexities. In this paper, we present a comprehensive review of the development and recent advances in trajectory computing, from deep learning to the more recent large language models. We first define trajectory data and provide a brief overview of widely-used deep learning models. Systematically, we explore deep learning applications in trajectory management (pre-processing, storage, analysis, and visualization) and mining (trajectory-related forecasting, trajectory-related recommendation, trajectory classification, travel time estimation, anomaly detection, and mobility generation). Furthermore, we discuss emerging research directions and recent advancements in large models (represented by foundation models and large language models) for trajectory computing, which promise to reshape the next generation of trajectory computing. Additionally, we summarize application scenarios, public datasets, and toolkits. Finally, we outline current challenges in trajectory computing research and propose future directions.

However, we find that the perpendicular component of the pushing force from negative samples in contrastive learning is a double-edged sword: it contains rich supplementary information from negative samples, yet its unconstrained nature causes optimization trajectory drift and training instability. To address this, we propose Support Vector Regularization (SVR), a method that introduces an auxiliary support vector to control this perpendicular component, aiming to harness its rich information while mitigating the associated trajectory drift. The efficacy of SVR is critically governed by its semantic radius, for which we explore two unsupervised modeling strategies: direct parameterization and an adaptive radius predictor module enhanced with constraints to improve its predicting accuracy. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method surpasses widely used baselines like InfoNCE and SigLIP loss across classification, monolingual retrieval, and multilingual retrieval on standard audio-text datasets. Both the theoretical analysis and the experimental results on optimizing trajectory drift validate the correctness and effectiveness of our SVR method. Notably, our method is highly efficient, it operates without the need for extra training data or inference computation, and adds only a negligible overhead to the training.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trajectory Consistency for One-Step Generation on Euler Mean Flows](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02571v1)** | 2026-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose \emph{Euler Mean Flows (EMF)}, a flow-based generative framework for one-step and few-step generation that enforces long-range trajectory consistency with minimal sampling cost. The key idea of EMF is to replace the trajectory consistency constraint, which is difficult to supervise and optimize over long time scales, with a principled linear surrogate that enables direct data supervision for long-horizon flow-map compositions. We derive this approximation from the semigroup formulation of flow-based models and show that, under mild regularity assumptions, it faithfully approximates the original consistency objective while being substantially easier to optimize. This formulation leads to a unified, JVP-free training framework that supports both $u$-prediction and $x_1$-prediction variants, avoiding explicit Jacobian computations and significantly reducing memory and computational overhead. Experiments on image synthesis, particle-based geometry generation, and functional generation demonstrate improved optimization stability and sample quality under fixed sampling budgets, together with approximately $50\%$ reductions in training time and memory consumption compared to existing one-step methods for image generation.</p></details> | 40 pages, 27 figures |

However, current sampling methods rely on simple confidence-based heuristics that ignore the long-term impact of local decisions, leading to trajectory lock-in where early hallucinations cascade into global incoherence. While search-based methods mitigate this, they incur prohibitive computational costs ($O(K)$ forward passes per step). In this work, we propose Backward-on-Entropy (BoE) Steering, a gradient-guided inference framework that approximates infinite-horizon lookahead via a single backward pass. We formally derive the Token Influence Score (TIS) from a first-order expansion of the trajectory cost functional, proving that the gradient of future entropy with respect to input embeddings serves as an optimal control signal for minimizing uncertainty. To ensure scalability, we introduce \texttt{ActiveQueryAttention}, a sparse adjoint primitive that exploits the structure of the masking objective to reduce backward pass complexity. BoE achieves a superior Pareto frontier for inference-time scaling compared to existing unmasking methods, demonstrating that gradient-guided steering offers a mathematically principled and efficient path to robust non-autoregressive generation.

| **[Probing the Trajectories of Reasoning Traces in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23163v1)** | 2026-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) increasingly solve difficult problems by producing "reasoning traces" before emitting a final response. However, it remains unclear how accuracy and decision commitment evolve along a reasoning trajectory, and whether intermediate trace segments provide answer-relevant information beyond generic length or stylistic effects. Here, we propose a protocol to systematically probe the trajectories of reasoning traces in LLMs by 1) generating a model's reasoning trace, 2) truncating it at fixed token-percentiles, and 3) injecting each partial trace back into the model (or a different model) to measure the induced distribution over answer choices via next-token probabilities. We apply this protocol to the open-source Qwen3-4B/-8B/-14B and gpt-oss-20b/-120b models across the multiple-choice GPQA Diamond and MMLU-Pro benchmarks. We find that accuracy and decision commitment consistently increase as the percentage of provided reasoning tokens grows. These gains are primarily driven by relevant content in the model generation rather than context length or generic "reasoning style" effects. Stronger models often backtrack successfully from incorrect partial traces, but immediate answers often remain anchored in the weaker model's incorrect response. More broadly, we show that trajectory probing provides diagnostics for efficient and safer deployment of reasoning models as the measurements can inform practical trace-handling and monitoring policies that improve reliability without assuming intermediate tokens are inherently faithful explanations.</p></details> | <details><summary>33 pa...</summary><p>33 pages, 20 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

We propose ContextFlow, a novel context-aware flow matching framework that incorporates prior knowledge to guide the inference of structural tissue dynamics from spatially resolved omics data. Specifically, ContextFlow integrates local tissue organization and ligand-receptor communication patterns into a transition plausibility matrix that regularizes the optimal transport objective. By embedding these contextual constraints, ContextFlow generates trajectories that are not only statistically consistent but also biologically meaningful, making it a generalizable framework for modeling spatiotemporal dynamics from longitudinal, spatially resolved omics data. Evaluated on three datasets, ContextFlow consistently outperforms state-of-the-art flow matching methods across multiple quantitative and qualitative metrics of inference accuracy and biological coherence.

To address these challenges, in this paper, we propose AutoTraj, a two-stage framework that automatically learns TIR by repairing and rewarding tool-use trajectories. Specifically, in the supervised fine-tuning (SFT) stage, AutoTraj generates multiple candidate tool-use trajectories for each query and evaluates them along multiple dimensions. High-quality trajectories are directly retained, while low-quality ones are repaired using a LLM (i.e., LLM-as-Repairer). The resulting repaired and high-quality trajectories form a synthetic SFT dataset, while each repaired trajectory paired with its original low-quality counterpart constitutes a dataset for trajectory preference modeling. In the reinforcement learning (RL) stage, based on the preference dataset, we train a trajectory-level reward model to assess the quality of reasoning paths and combine it with outcome and format rewards, thereby explicitly guiding the optimization toward reliable TIR behaviors. Experiments on real-world benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of AutoTraj in TIR.</p></details> |  |

On Hallucination Evaluation in Full Research Trajectory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22984v1)** | 2026-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diagnosing the failure mechanisms of Deep Research Agents (DRAs) remains a critical challenge. Existing benchmarks predominantly rely on end-to-end evaluation, obscuring critical intermediate hallucinations, such as flawed planning, that accumulate throughout the research trajectory. To bridge this gap, we propose a shift from outcome-based to process-aware evaluation by auditing the full research trajectory. We introduce the PIES Taxonomy to categorize hallucinations along functional components (Planning vs. Summarization) and error properties (Explicit vs. Implicit). We instantiate this taxonomy into a fine-grained evaluation framework that decomposes the trajectory to rigorously quantify these hallucinations. Leveraging this framework to isolate 100 distinctively hallucination-prone tasks including adversarial scenarios, we curate DeepHalluBench. Experiments on six state-of-theart DRAs reveal that no system achieves robust reliability. Furthermore, our diagnostic analysis traces the etiology of these failures to systemic deficits, specifically hallucination propagation and cognitive biases, providing foundational insights to guide future architectural optimization. Data and code are available at https://github.com/yuhao-zhan/DeepHalluBench.</p></details> |  |
| **[AccidentSim: Generating Vehicle Collision Videos with Physically Realistic Collision Trajectories from Real-World Accident Reports](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20654v2)** | 2026-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Collecting real-world vehicle accident videos for autonomous driving research is challenging due to their rarity and complexity. While existing driving video generation methods may produce visually realistic videos, they often fail to deliver physically realistic simulations because they lack the capability to generate accurate post-collision trajectories. In this paper, we introduce AccidentSim, a novel framework that generates physically realistic vehicle collision videos by extracting and utilizing the physical clues and contextual information available in real-world vehicle accident reports. Specifically, AccidentSim leverages a reliable physical simulator to replicate post-collision vehicle trajectories from the physical and contextual information in the accident reports and to build a vehicle collision trajectory dataset. This dataset is then used to fine-tune a language model, enabling it to respond to user prompts and predict physically consistent post-collision trajectories across various driving scenarios based on user descriptions. Finally, we employ Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) to render high-quality backgrounds, merging them with the foreground vehicles that exhibit physically realistic trajectories to generate vehicle collision videos. Experimental results demonstrate that the videos produced by AccidentSim excel in both visual and physical authenticity.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods still require manual intervention, depend on non-verifiable simulated environments, rely exclusively on either supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or reinforcement learning (RL), and struggle with stable long-horizon, multi-turn learning. To address these challenges, we introduce ASTRA, a fully automated end-to-end framework for training tool-augmented language model agents via scalable data synthesis and verifiable reinforcement learning. ASTRA integrates two complementary components. First, a pipeline that leverages the static topology of tool-call graphs synthesizes diverse, structurally grounded trajectories, instilling broad and transferable tool-use competence. Second, an environment synthesis framework that captures the rich, compositional topology of human semantic reasoning converts decomposed question-answer traces into independent, code-executable, and rule-verifiable environments, enabling deterministic multi-turn RL. Based on this method, we develop a unified training methodology that integrates SFT with online RL using trajectory-level rewards to balance task completion and interaction efficiency. Experiments on multiple agentic tool-use benchmarks demonstrate that ASTRA-trained models achieve state-of-the-art performance at comparable scales, approaching closed-source systems while preserving core reasoning ability. We release the full pipelines, environments, and trained models at https://github.com/LianjiaTech/astra.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generalizable Multimodal Large Language Model Editing via Invariant Trajectory Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19700v2)** | 2026-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knowledge editing emerges as a crucial technique for efficiently correcting incorrect or outdated knowledge in large language models (LLM). Existing editing methods rely on a rigid mapping from parameter or module modifications to output, which causes the generalization limitation in Multimodal LLM (MLLM). In this paper, we reformulate MLLM editing as an out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization problem, where the goal is to discern semantic shift with factual shift and thus achieve robust editing among diverse cross-modal prompting. The key challenge of this OOD problem lies in identifying invariant causal trajectories that generalize accurately while suppressing spurious correlations. To address it, we propose ODEdit, a plug-and-play invariant learning based framework that optimizes the tripartite OOD risk objective to simultaneously enhance editing reliability, locality, and generality.We further introduce an edit trajectory invariant learning method, which integrates a total variation penalty into the risk minimization objective to stabilize edit trajectories against environmental variations. Theoretical analysis and extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of ODEdit.</p></details> |  |
| **[DRL-Enabled Trajectory Planing for UAV-Assisted VLC: Optimal Altitude and Reward Design](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22512v1)** | 2026-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, the integration of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and visible light communication (VLC) technologies has emerged as a promising solution to offer flexible communication and efficient lighting. This letter investigates the three-dimensional trajectory planning in a UAV-assisted VLC system, where a UAV is dispatched to collect data from ground users (GUs). The core objective is to develop a trajectory planning framework that minimizes UAV flight distance, which is equivalent to maximizing the data collection efficiency. This issue is formulated as a challenging mixed-integer non-convex optimization problem. To tackle it, we first derive a closed-form optimal flight altitude under specific VLC channel gain threshold. Subsequently, we optimize the UAV horizontal trajectory by integrating a novel pheromone-driven reward mechanism with the twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm, which enables adaptive UAV motion strategy in complex environments. Simulation results validate that the derived optimal altitude effectively reduces the flight distance by up to 35% compared to baseline methods. Additionally, the proposed reward mechanism significantly shortens the convergence steps by approximately 50%, demonstrating notable efficiency gains in the context of UAV-assisted VLC data collection.</p></details> |  |
| **[Drive-JEPA: Video JEPA Meets Multimodal Trajectory Distillation for End-to-End Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22032v1)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>End-to-end autonomous driving increasingly leverages self-supervised video pretraining to learn transferable planning representations. However, pretraining video world models for scene understanding has so far brought only limited improvements. This limitation is compounded by the inherent ambiguity of driving: each scene typically provides only a single human trajectory, making it difficult to learn multimodal behaviors. In this work, we propose Drive-JEPA, a framework that integrates Video Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture (V-JEPA) with multimodal trajectory distillation for end-to-end driving. First, we adapt V-JEPA for end-to-end driving, pretraining a ViT encoder on large-scale driving videos to produce predictive representations aligned with trajectory planning. Second, we introduce a proposal-centric planner that distills diverse simulator-generated trajectories alongside human trajectories, with a momentum-aware selection mechanism to promote stable and safe behavior. When evaluated on NAVSIM, the V-JEPA representation combined with a simple transformer-based decoder outperforms prior methods by 3 PDMS in the perception-free setting. The complete Drive-JEPA framework achieves 93.3 PDMS on v1 and 87.8 EPDMS on v2, setting a new state-of-the-art.</p></details> |  |
| **[d3LLM: Ultra-Fast Diffusion LLM using Pseudo-Trajectory Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07568v2)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) offer capabilities beyond those of autoregressive (AR) LLMs, such as parallel decoding and random-order generation. However, realizing these benefits in practice is non-trivial, as dLLMs inherently face an accuracy-parallelism trade-off. Despite increasing interest, existing methods typically focus on only one-side of the coin, targeting either efficiency or performance. To address this limitation, we propose d3LLM (Pseudo-Distilled Diffusion Large Language Model), striking a balance between accuracy and parallelism: (i) during training, we introduce pseudo-trajectory distillation to teach the model which tokens can be decoded confidently at early steps, thereby improving parallelism; (ii) during inference, we employ entropy-based multi-block decoding with a KV-cache refresh mechanism to achieve high parallelism while maintaining accuracy. To better evaluate dLLMs, we also introduce AUP (Accuracy Under Parallelism), a new metric that jointly measures accuracy and parallelism. Experiments demonstrate that our d3LLM achieves up to 10$\times$ speedup over vanilla LLaDA/Dream and 5$\times$ speedup over AR models without much accuracy drop. Our code is available at https://github.com/hao-ai-lab/d3LLM.</p></details> |  |

Instead of suppressing diffusion updates or applying masking heuristics, our approach reinterprets diffusion as the evolution of stochastic trajectories through a structured latent space. By shaping the initial noise and its geometric alignment, background generation naturally avoids designated foreground regions, allowing readable content to remain intact without auxiliary mechanisms. To address the long-standing issue of stylistic drift across pages, we decouple style control from text conditioning and introduce cached style directions as persistent vectors in latent space. Once selected, these directions constrain diffusion trajectories to a shared stylistic subspace, ensuring consistent appearance across pages and editing iterations. This formulation eliminates the need for repeated prompt-based style specification and provides a more stable foundation for multi-page generation. Our framework admits a geometric and physical interpretation, where diffusion paths evolve on a latent manifold shaped by preferred directions, and foreground regions are rarely traversed as a consequence of trajectory initialization rather than explicit exclusion. The proposed method is training-free, compatible with existing diffusion backbones, and produces visually coherent, foreground-preserving results across complex documents. By reframing diffusion as trajectory design in latent space, we offer a principled approach to consistent and structured generative modeling.</p></details> | 47 pages, 36 figures |

Existing methods often struggle to maintain global directional consistency, leading to drifting or implausible trajectories when extrapolated over long time horizons. To address this issue, we propose a semantic-key-point-conditioned trajectory modeling framework, in which future trajectories are predicted by conditioning on a high-level Next Key Point (NKP) that captures navigational intent. This formulation decomposes long-horizon prediction into global semantic decision-making and local motion modeling, effectively restricting the support of future trajectories to semantically feasible subsets. To efficiently estimate the NKP prior from historical observations, we adopt a pretrain-finetune strategy. Extensive experiments on real-world AIS data demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, particularly for long travel durations, directional accuracy, and fine-grained trajectory prediction.</p></details> |  |

To bridge this gap, we introduce JointDiff, a novel diffusion framework designed to unify these two processes by simultaneously generating continuous spatio-temporal data and synchronous discrete events. We demonstrate its efficacy in the sports domain by simultaneously modeling multi-agent trajectories and key possession events. This joint modeling is validated with non-controllable generation and two novel controllable generation scenarios: weak-possessor-guidance, which offers flexible semantic control over game dynamics through a simple list of intended ball possessors, and text-guidance, which enables fine-grained, language-driven generation. To enable the conditioning with these guidance signals, we introduce CrossGuid, an effective conditioning operation for multi-agent domains. We also share a new unified sports benchmark enhanced with textual descriptions for soccer and football datasets. JointDiff achieves state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating that joint modeling is crucial for building realistic and controllable generative models for interactive systems. https://guillem-cf.github.io/JointDiff/</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICLR 2026</p></details> |

For example, a vehicle's dynamics evolve gradually through a turning maneuver, and human gait shifts smoothly from walking to running. We formalize this setting by modeling transitional mechanisms as convex combinations of finitely many atomic mechanisms, governed by time-varying mixing coefficients. Our theoretical contributions establish that both the latent causal variables and the continuous mixing trajectory are jointly identifiable. We further propose TRACE, a Mixture-of-Experts framework where each expert learns one atomic mechanism during training, enabling recovery of mechanism trajectories at test time. This formulation generalizes to intermediate mechanism states never observed during training. Experiments on synthetic and real-world data demonstrate that TRACE recovers mixing trajectories with up to 0.99 correlation, substantially outperforming discrete-switching baselines.</p></details> | 23 pages, 11 figures |

Optimizing the trajectory over the full racing horizon is computationally expensive, and tracking such a trajectory in the real world hardly assures global optimality due to uncertain dynamics. Yet, existing work mostly focuses on dynamics learning at the tracking level, without updating the trajectory itself to account for the learned dynamics. To address these challenges, we propose a track-centric approach that directly learns and optimizes the full-horizon trajectory. We first represent trajectories through a track-agnostic parametric space in light of the wavelet transform. This space is then efficiently explored using Bayesian optimization, where the lap time of each candidate is evaluated by running simulations with the learned dynamics. This optimization is embedded in an iterative learning framework, where the optimized trajectory is deployed to collect real-world data for updating the dynamics, progressively refining the trajectory over the iterations. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is validated through simulations and real-world experiments, demonstrating lap time improvement of up to 20.7% over a nominal baseline and consistently outperforming state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

Modular pipelines restrict information flow and can amplify upstream errors. Recent query-based, fully differentiable perception-and-prediction (PnP) models mitigate these issues, yet the complementarity of cameras and LiDAR in the query-space has not been sufficiently explored. Models often rely on fusion schemes that introduce heuristic alignment and discrete selection steps which prevent full utilization of available information and can introduce unwanted bias. We propose Li-ViP3D++, a query-based multimodal PnP framework that introduces Query-Gated Deformable Fusion (QGDF) to integrate multi-view RGB and LiDAR in query space. QGDF (i) aggregates image evidence via masked attention across cameras and feature levels, (ii) extracts LiDAR context through fully differentiable BEV sampling with learned per-query offsets, and (iii) applies query-conditioned gating to adaptively weight visual and geometric cues per agent. The resulting architecture jointly optimizes detection, tracking, and multi-hypothesis trajectory forecasting in a single end-to-end model. On nuScenes, Li-ViP3D++ improves end-to-end behavior and detection quality, achieving higher EPA (0.335) and mAP (0.502) while substantially reducing false positives (FP ratio 0.147), and it is faster than the prior Li-ViP3D variant (139.82 ms vs. 145.91 ms). These results indicate that query-space, fully differentiable camera-LiDAR fusion can increase robustness of end-to-end PnP without sacrificing deployability.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |

This paper presents a scalable alternative: high-accuracy whole-body touch localization via vibro-acoustic sensing. By equipping a robotic hand with seven low-cost piezoelectric microphones and leveraging an Audio Spectrogram Transformer, we decode the vibrational signatures generated during physical interaction. Extensive evaluation across stationary and dynamic tasks reveals a localization error of under 5 mm in static conditions. Furthermore, our analysis highlights the distinct influence of material properties: stiff materials (e.g., metal) excel in impulse response localization due to sharp, high-bandwidth responses, whereas textured materials (e.g., wood) provide superior friction-based features for trajectory tracking. The system demonstrates robustness to the robot's own motion, maintaining effective tracking even during active operation. Our primary contribution is demonstrating that complex physical contact dynamics can be effectively decoded from simple vibrational signals, offering a viable pathway to widespread, affordable contact perception in robotics. To accelerate research, we provide our full datasets, models, and experimental setups as open-source resources.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under Review: Springer Autonomous Robots Journal</p></details> |

Despite the success of textual safety moderation, its multimodal counterparts remain hindered by a dual sparsity of data and supervision. Conventional reliance on binary labels lead to shortcut learning, which obscures the intrinsic classification boundaries necessary for effective multimodal discrimination. Hence, we propose a novel learning paradigm (UniMod) that transitions from sparse decision-making to dense reasoning traces. By constructing structured trajectories encompassing evidence grounding, modality assessment, risk mapping, policy decision, and response generation, we reformulate monolithic decision tasks into a multi-dimensional boundary learning process. This approach forces the model to ground its decision in explicit safety semantics, preventing the model from converging on superficial shortcuts. To facilitate this paradigm, we develop a multi-head scalar reward model (UniRM). UniRM provides multi-dimensional supervision by assigning attribute-level scores to the response generation stage. Furthermore, we introduce specialized optimization strategies to decouple task-specific parameters and rebalance training dynamics, effectively resolving interference between diverse objectives in multi-task learning. Empirical results show UniMod achieves competitive textual moderation performance and sets a new multimodal benchmark using less than 40\% of the training data used by leading baselines. Ablations further validate our multi-attribute trajectory reasoning, offering an effective and efficient framework for multimodal moderation.

We argue that current evaluation paradigms suffer from an unanchored defect, leading to two forms of instability: process drift, where unsteered client simulation wanders away from specific counseling goals, and standard drift, where static pointwise scoring lacks the stability for reliable judgment. To address this, we introduce Ps, a unified framework that calibrates the therapeutic competence of LLMs via trajectory-anchored tournaments. We first anchor the interaction trajectory in simulation, where clients precisely control the fluid consultation process to probe multifaceted capabilities. We then anchor the battle trajectory in judgments through an efficient Swiss-system tournament, utilizing dynamic pairwise battles to yield robust Elo ratings. Beyond ranking, we demonstrate that tournament trajectories can be transformed into credible reward signals, enabling on-policy reinforcement learning to enhance LLMs' performance. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of PsychePass and its strong consistency with human expert judgments.</p></details> |  |

Learning-based MAPF solvers offer fast and scalable planning but often produce feasible trajectories that contain unnecessary or oscillatory movements. We propose Judgelight, a post-optimization layer that improves trajectory quality after a MAPF solver generates a feasible schedule. Judgelight collapses closed subwalks in agents' trajectories to remove redundant movements while preserving all feasibility constraints. We formalize this process as MAPF-Collapse, prove that it is NP-hard, and present an exact optimization approach by formulating it as integer linear programming (ILP) problem. Experimental results show Judgelight consistently reduces solution cost by around 20%, particularly for learning-based solvers, producing trajectories that are better suited for real-world deployment.</p></details> |  |

To this end, a deep autoencoder (DAE) model is employed to infer the ID in the weakly nonlinear regime ($β\lesssim 1$). We find that the trajectories lie on a nonlinear manifold of dimension $m^{\ast} = 2$ embedded in a $64$-dimensional phase space. The DAE further reveals that this dimensionality increases to $m^{\ast} = 3$ at $β= 1.1$, coinciding with a symmetry breaking transition, in which additional energy modes with even wave numbers $k = 2, 4$ become excited. Finally, we discuss the limitations of the linear approach based on principal component analysis (PCA), which fails to capture the underlying structure of the data and therefore yields unreliable results in most cases.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 10 figures.

Configuration Space Distance Fields (CDF) enable fixed-base manipulators to model collisions directly in configuration space via smooth, implicit distances. This representation holds strong potential to bypass the nonlinear configuration-to-workspace mapping while preserving accurate whole-body geometry and providing optimization-friendly collision costs. Yet, extending this capability to mobile manipulators is hindered by unbounded workspaces and tighter base-arm coupling. We lift this promise to mobile manipulation with Generalized Configuration Space Distance Fields (GCDF), extending CDF to robots with both translational and rotational joints in unbounded workspaces with tighter base-arm coupling. We prove that GCDF preserves Euclidean-like local distance structure and accurately encodes whole-body geometry in configuration space, and develop a data generation and training pipeline that yields continuous neural GCDFs with accurate values and gradients, supporting efficient GPU-batched queries. Building on this representation, we develop a high-performance sequential convex optimization framework centered on GCDF-based collision reasoning. The solver scales to large numbers of implicit constraints through (i) online specification of neural constraints, (ii) sparsity-aware active-set detection with parallel batched evaluation across thousands of constraints, and (iii) incremental constraint management for rapid replanning under scene changes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Video Generation for Robotic Manipulation with Collaborative Trajectory Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01943v3)** | 2026-01-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in video diffusion models shows promise for generating robotic decision-making data, with trajectory conditions further enabling fine-grained control. However, existing methods primarily focus on individual object motion and struggle to capture multi-object interaction crucial in complex manipulation. This limitation arises from entangled features in overlapping regions, leading to degraded visual fidelity. To address this, we present RoboMaster, a novel framework that models inter-object dynamics via a collaborative trajectory formulation. Unlike prior methods that decompose objects, our core is to decompose the interaction process into three sub-stages: pre-interaction, interaction, and post-interaction, and models each phase using the dominant object, specifically the robotic arm in the pre- and post-interaction phases and the manipulated object during interaction. This design effectively alleviates the multi-object feature fusion issue in prior work. To further ensure subject semantic consistency across the video, we incorporate appearance- and shape-aware latent representations for objects. Extensive experiments on the challenging Bridge dataset, as well as RLBench and SIMPLER benchmarks, demonstrate that our method establishs new state-of-the-art performance in trajectory-controlled video generation for robotic manipulation.

| **[Efficient UAV trajectory prediction: A multi-modal deep diffusion framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00107v1)** | 2026-01-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To meet the requirements for managing unauthorized UAVs in the low-altitude economy, a multi-modal UAV trajectory prediction method based on the fusion of LiDAR and millimeter-wave radar information is proposed. A deep fusion network for multi-modal UAV trajectory prediction, termed the Multi-Modal Deep Fusion Framework, is designed. The overall architecture consists of two modality-specific feature extraction networks and a bidirectional cross-attention fusion module, aiming to fully exploit the complementary information of LiDAR and radar point clouds in spatial geometric structure and dynamic reflection characteristics. In the feature extraction stage, the model employs independent but structurally identical feature encoders for LiDAR and radar. After feature extraction, the model enters the Bidirectional Cross-Attention Mechanism stage to achieve information complementarity and semantic alignment between the two modalities. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed model, the MMAUD dataset used in the CVPR 2024 UG2+ UAV Tracking and Pose-Estimation Challenge is adopted as the training and testing dataset. Experimental results show that the proposed multi-modal fusion model significantly improves trajectory prediction accuracy, achieving a 40% improvement compared to the baseline model. In addition, ablation experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of different loss functions and post-processing strategies in improving model performance. The proposed model can effectively utilize multi-modal data and provides an efficient solution for unauthorized UAV trajectory prediction in the low-altitude economy.</p></details> | in Chinese language |
| **[Generative Chain of Behavior for User Trajectory Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18213v1)** | 2026-01-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modeling long-term user behavior trajectories is essential for understanding evolving preferences and enabling proactive recommendations. However, most sequential recommenders focus on next-item prediction, overlooking dependencies across multiple future actions. We propose Generative Chain of Behavior (GCB), a generative framework that models user interactions as an autoregressive chain of semantic behaviors over multiple future steps. GCB first encodes items into semantic IDs via RQ-VAE with k-means refinement, forming a discrete latent space that preserves semantic proximity. On top of this space, a transformer-based autoregressive generator predicts multi-step future behaviors conditioned on user history, capturing long-horizon intent transitions and generating coherent trajectories. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that GCB consistently outperforms state-of-the-art sequential recommenders in multi-step accuracy and trajectory consistency. Beyond these gains, GCB offers a unified generative formulation for capturing user preference evolution.</p></details> |  |
| **[Universal Refusal Circuits Across LLMs: Cross-Model Transfer via Trajectory Replay and Concept-Basis Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16034v2)** | 2026-01-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Refusal behavior in aligned LLMs is often viewed as model-specific, yet we hypothesize it stems from a universal, low-dimensional semantic circuit shared across models. To test this, we introduce Trajectory Replay via Concept-Basis Reconstruction, a framework that transfers refusal interventions from donor to target models, spanning diverse architectures (e.g., Dense to MoE) and training regimes, without using target-side refusal supervision. By aligning layers via concept fingerprints and reconstructing refusal directions using a shared ``recipe'' of concept atoms, we map the donor's ablation trajectory into the target's semantic space. To preserve capabilities, we introduce a weight-SVD stability guard that projects interventions away from high-variance weight subspaces to prevent collateral damage. Our evaluation across 8 model pairs confirms that these transferred recipes consistently attenuate refusal while maintaining performance, providing strong evidence for the semantic universality of safety alignment.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multimodal Trajectory Representation Learning for Travel Time Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05840v2)** | 2026-01-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate travel time estimation (TTE) plays a crucial role in intelligent transportation systems. However, it remains challenging due to heterogeneous data sources and complex traffic dynamics. Moreover, traditional approaches typically convert trajectory data into fixed-length representations. This overlooks the inherent variability of real-world motion patterns, often resulting in information loss and redundancy. To address these challenges, this paper introduces the Multimodal Dynamic Trajectory Integration (MDTI) framework--a novel multimodal trajectory representation learning approach that integrates GPS sequences, grid trajectories, and road network constraints to enhance the performance of TTE. MDTI employs modality-specific encoders and a multimodal fusion module to capture complementary spatial, temporal, and topological semantics, while a dynamic trajectory modeling mechanism adaptively regulates information density for trajectories of varying lengths. Two self-supervised pretraining objectives, named contrastive alignment and masked language modeling, further strengthen multimodal consistency and contextual understanding. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that MDTI consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, confirming its robustness and strong generalization abilities. The code is publicly available at: https://github.com/City-Computing/MDTI.</p></details> |  |
| **[Harnessing Reasoning Trajectories for Hallucination Detection via Answer-agreement Representation Shaping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17467v1)** | 2026-01-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large reasoning models (LRMs) often generate long, seemingly coherent reasoning traces yet still produce incorrect answers, making hallucination detection challenging. Although trajectories contain useful signals, directly using trace text or vanilla hidden states for detection is brittle: traces vary in form and detectors can overfit to superficial patterns rather than answer validity. We introduce Answer-agreement Representation Shaping (ARS), which learns detection-friendly trace-conditioned representations by explicitly encoding answer stability. ARS generates counterfactual answers through small latent interventions, specifically, perturbing the trace-boundary embedding, and labels each perturbation by whether the resulting answer agrees with the original. It then learns representations that bring answer-agreeing states together and separate answer-disagreeing ones, exposing latent instability indicative of hallucination risk. The shaped embeddings are plug-and-play with existing embedding-based detectors and require no human annotations during training. Experiments demonstrate that ARS consistently improves detection and achieves substantial gains over strong baselines.</p></details> |  |

Existing approaches focus on single learning experiences and do not account for students' gradual knowledge construction and evolving skill sets. Moreover, large language models are optimized to produce direct and accurate responses, making it challenging to represent the incomplete understanding and developmental constraints that characterize real learners. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework for memory-based student simulation that incorporates developmental trajectories through a hierarchical memory mechanism with structured knowledge representation. The framework also integrates metacognitive processes and personality traits to enrich the individual learner profiling, through dynamical consolidation of both cognitive development and personal learning characteristics. In practice, we implement a curriculum-aligned simulator grounded on the Next Generation Science Standards. Experimental results show that our approach can effectively reflect the gradual nature of knowledge development and the characteristic difficulties students face, providing a more accurate representation of learning processes.</p></details> | <details><summary>Fixed...</summary><p>Fixed some grammar and format issues.

Graph-based solvers provide global guarantees but assume pre-selected measurement locations, while continuous trajectory optimization supports path-based sensing but is computationally intensive and sensitive to initialization in obstacle-dense settings. We propose a hierarchical framework with three stages: (i) graph-based global planning, (ii) segment-wise budget allocation using geometric and kernel bounds, and (iii) spline-based refinement of each segment with hard constraints and obstacle pruning. By combining global guidance with local refinement, our method achieves lower posterior uncertainty than graph-only and continuous baselines, while running faster than continuous-space solvers (up to 9x faster than gradient-based methods and 20x faster than black-box optimizers) across synthetic cluttered environments and Arctic datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Trajectory Alignment Coefficient in Two Acts: From Reward Tuning to Reward Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16906v1)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The success of reinforcement learning (RL) is fundamentally tied to having a reward function that accurately reflects the task objective. Yet, designing reward functions is notoriously time-consuming and prone to misspecification. To address this issue, our first goal is to understand how to support RL practitioners in specifying appropriate weights for a reward function. We leverage the Trajectory Alignment Coefficient (TAC), a metric that evaluates how closely a reward function's induced preferences match those of a domain expert. To evaluate whether TAC provides effective support in practice, we conducted a human-subject study in which RL practitioners tuned reward weights for Lunar Lander. We found that providing TAC during reward tuning led participants to produce more performant reward functions and report lower cognitive workload relative to standard tuning without TAC. However, the study also underscored that manual reward design, even with TAC, remains labor-intensive. This limitation motivated our second goal: to learn a reward model that maximizes TAC directly. Specifically, we propose Soft-TAC, a differentiable approximation of TAC that can be used as a loss function to train reward models from human preference data. Validated in the racing simulator Gran Turismo 7, reward models trained using Soft-TAC successfully captured preference-specific objectives, resulting in policies with qualitatively more distinct behaviors than models trained with standard Cross-Entropy loss. This work demonstrates that TAC can serve as both a practical tool for guiding reward tuning and a reward learning objective in complex domains.</p></details> |  |

This paper presents HumanDiffusion, a lightweight image-conditioned diffusion planner that generates human-aware navigation trajectories directly from RGB imagery. The system combines YOLO-11 based human detection with diffusion-driven trajectory generation, enabling a quadrotor to approach a target person and deliver medical assistance without relying on prior maps or computationally intensive planning pipelines. Trajectories are predicted in pixel space, ensuring smooth motion and a consistent safety margin around humans. We evaluate HumanDiffusion in simulation and real-world indoor mock-disaster scenarios. On a 300-sample test set, the model achieves a mean squared error of 0.02 in pixel-space trajectory reconstruction. Real-world experiments demonstrate an overall mission success rate of 80% across accident-response and search-and-locate tasks with partial occlusions. These results indicate that human-conditioned diffusion planning offers a practical and robust solution for human-aware UAV navigation in time-critical assistance settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted at HRI, Late Breaking Report, 2026</p></details> |
| **[MoE-Enhanced Multi-Domain Feature Selection and Fusion for Fast Map-Free Trajectory Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02368v2)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction is crucial for the reliability and safety of autonomous driving systems, yet it remains a challenging task in complex interactive scenarios due to noisy trajectory observations and intricate agent interactions. Existing methods often struggle to filter redundant scene data for discriminative information extraction, directly impairing trajectory prediction accuracy especially when handling outliers and dynamic multi-agent interactions. In response to these limitations, we present a novel map-free trajectory prediction method which adaptively eliminates redundant information and selects discriminative features across the temporal, spatial, and frequency domains, thereby enabling precise trajectory prediction in real-world driving environments. First, we design a MoE based frequency domain filter to adaptively weight distinct frequency components of observed trajectory data and suppress outlier related noise; then a selective spatiotemporal attention module that reallocates weights across temporal nodes (sequential dependencies), temporal trends (evolution patterns), and spatial nodes to extract salient information is proposed. Finally, our multimodal decoder-supervised by joint patch level and point-level losses generates reasonable and temporally consistent trajectories, and comprehensive experiments on the large-scale NuScenes and Argoverse dataset demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance and low-latency inference performance compared with recently proposed methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[R$^2$PO: Decoupling Training Trajectories from Inference Responses for LLM Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11960v2)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning has become a central paradigm for improving LLM reasoning. However, existing methods use a single policy to produce both inference responses and training optimization trajectories. The objective conflict between generating stable inference responses and diverse training trajectories leads to insufficient exploration, which harms reasoning capability. In this paper, to address the problem, we propose R$^2$PO (Residual Rollout Policy Optimization), which introduces a lightweight Residual Rollout-Head atop the policy to decouple training trajectories from inference responses, enabling controlled trajectory diversification during training while keeping inference generation stable. Experiments across multiple benchmarks show that our method consistently outperforms baselines, achieving average accuracy gains of 3.4% on MATH-500 and 1.3% on APPS, while also reducing formatting errors and mitigating length bias for stable optimization.

We extend this line of work to the social sciences by introducing a Transformer-based generative model tailored to longitudinal socio-economic data. Our contributions are: (i) we design a novel encoding method that represents socio-economic life histories as sequences, including overlapping events across life domains; and (ii) we adapt generative modelling techniques to simulate plausible alternative life trajectories conditioned on past histories. Using large-scale data from the Italian social security administration (INPS), we show that the model can be trained at scale, reproduces realistic labour market patterns consistent with known causal relationships, and generates coherent hypothetical life paths. This work demonstrates the feasibility of generative modelling for socio-economic trajectories and opens new opportunities for policy-oriented research, with counterfactual generation as a particularly promising application.</p></details> |  |
| **[Emerging from Ground: Addressing Intent Deviation in Tool-Using Agents via Deriving Real Calls into Virtual Trajectories](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15120v2)** | 2026-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLMs have advanced tool-using agents for real-world applications, yet they often lead to unexpected behaviors or results. Beyond obvious failures, the subtle issue of "intent deviation" severely hinders reliable evaluation and performance improvement. Existing post-training methods generally leverage either real system samples or virtual data simulated by LLMs. However, the former is costly due to reliance on hand-crafted user requests, while the latter suffers from distribution shift from the real tools in the wild. Additionally, both methods lack negative samples tailored to intent deviation scenarios, hindering effective guidance on preference learning. We introduce RISE, a "Real-to-Virtual" method designed to mitigate intent deviation. Anchoring on verified tool primitives, RISE synthesizes virtual trajectories and generates diverse negative samples through mutation on critical parameters. With synthetic data, RISE fine-tunes backbone LLMs via the two-stage training for intent alignment. Evaluation results demonstrate that data synthesized by RISE achieve promising results in eight metrics covering user requires, execution trajectories and agent responses. Integrating with training, RISE achieves an average 35.28% improvement in Acctask (task completion) and 23.27% in Accintent (intent alignment), outperforming SOTA baselines by 1.20--42.09% and 1.17--54.93% respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[PAD-TRO: Projection-Augmented Diffusion for Direct Trajectory Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04436v2)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, diffusion models have gained popularity and attention in trajectory optimization due to their capability of modeling multi-modal probability distributions. However, addressing nonlinear equality constraints, i.e, dynamic feasibility, remains a great challenge in diffusion-based trajectory optimization. Recent diffusion-based trajectory optimization frameworks rely on a single-shooting style approach where the denoised control sequence is applied to forward propagate the dynamical system, which cannot explicitly enforce constraints on the states and frequently leads to sub-optimal solutions. In this work, we propose a novel direct trajectory optimization approach via model-based diffusion, which directly generates a sequence of states. To ensure dynamic feasibility, we propose a gradient-free projection mechanism that is incorporated into the reverse diffusion process. Our results show that, compared to a recent state-of-the-art baseline, our approach leads to zero dynamic feasibility error and approximately 4x higher success rate in a quadrotor waypoint navigation scenario involving dense static obstacles.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at the 2026 American Control Conference</p></details> |
| **[CLEANER: Self-Purified Trajectories Boost Agentic Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15141v1)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Agentic Reinforcement Learning (RL) has empowered Large Language Models (LLMs) to utilize tools like Python interpreters for complex problem-solving. However, for parameter-constrained models (e.g., 4B--7B), the exploration phase is often plagued by frequent execution failures, creating noisy trajectories that hinder policy optimization. Under standard outcome-based reward settings, this noise leads to a critical credit assignment issue, where erroneous actions are inadvertently reinforced alongside successful outcomes. Existing mitigations face a dilemma: dense rewards often trigger reward hacking, while supersampling incurs prohibitive computational costs. To address these challenges, we propose CLEANER. Distinct from external filtering methods, CLEANER exploits the model's intrinsic self-correction capabilities to eliminate error-contaminated context directly during data collection. At its core, the Similarity-Aware Adaptive Rollback (SAAR) mechanism autonomously constructs clean, purified trajectories by retrospectively replacing failures with successful self-corrections. Based on semantic similarity, SAAR adaptively regulates replacement granularity from shallow execution repairs to deep reasoning substitutions. By training on these self-purified paths, the model internalizes correct reasoning patterns rather than error-recovery loops. Empirical results on AIME24/25, GPQA, and LiveCodeBench show average accuracy gains of 6%, 3%, and 5% over baselines. Notably, CLEANER matches state-of-the-art performance using only one-third of the training steps, highlighting trajectory purification as a scalable solution for efficient agentic RL.

| **[Context-aware Learned Mesh-based Simulation via Trajectory-Level Meta-Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05234v2)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Simulating object deformations is a critical challenge across many scientific domains, including robotics, manufacturing, and structural mechanics. Learned Graph Network Simulators (GNSs) offer a promising alternative to traditional mesh-based physics simulators. Their speed and inherent differentiability make them particularly well suited for applications that require fast and accurate simulations, such as robotic manipulation or manufacturing optimization. However, existing learned simulators typically rely on single-step observations, which limits their ability to exploit temporal context. Without this information, these models fail to infer, e.g., material properties. Further, they rely on auto-regressive rollouts, which quickly accumulate error for long trajectories. We instead frame mesh-based simulation as a trajectory-level meta-learning problem. Using Conditional Neural Processes, our method enables rapid adaptation to new simulation scenarios from limited initial data while capturing their latent simulation properties. We utilize movement primitives to directly predict fast, stable and accurate simulations from a single model call. The resulting approach, Movement-primitive Meta-MeshGraphNet (M3GN), provides higher simulation accuracy at a fraction of the runtime cost compared to state-of-the-art GNSs across several tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>35 pa...</summary><p>35 pages.

| **[Trajectory-Driven Multi-Product Influence Maximization in Billboard Advertising](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14737v1)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Billboard Advertising has emerged as an effective out-of-home advertising technique, where the goal is to select a limited number of slots and play advertisement content there, with the hope that it will be observed by many people and, effectively, a significant number of them will be influenced towards the brand. Given a trajectory and a billboard database and a positive integer $k$, how can we select $k$ highly influential slots to maximize influence? In this paper, we study a variant of this problem where a commercial house wants to make a promotion of multiple products, and there is an influence demand for each product. We have studied two variants of the problem. In the first variant, our goal is to select $k$ slots such that the respective influence demand of each product is satisfied. In the other variant of the problem, we are given with $\ell$ integers $k_1,k_2, \ldots, k_{\ell}$, the goal here is to search for $\ell$ many set of slots $S_1, S_2, \ldots, S_{\ell}$ such that for all $i \in [\ell]$, $|S_{i}| \leq k_i$ and for all $i \neq j$, $S_i \cap S_j=\emptyset$ and the influence demand of each of the products gets satisfied. We model the first variant of the problem as a multi-submodular cover problem and the second variant as its generalization. To solve the common-slot variant, we formulate the problem as a multi-submodular cover problem and design a bi-criteria approximation algorithm based on the continuous greedy framework and randomized rounding. For the disjoint-slot variant, we proposed a sampling-based approximation approach along with an efficient primal-dual greedy algorithm that enforces disjointness naturally. Extensive experiments with real-world trajectory and billboard datasets highlight the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed solution approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 Pa...</summary><p>31 Pages. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2510.09050</p></details> |

Existing methods face two distinct challenges. Geometrically unconditioned models lack spatial awareness, leading to drift and deformation under viewpoint changes. On the other hand, geometrically-conditioned models depend on estimated depth and explicit reconstruction, making them susceptible to depth inaccuracies and calibration errors. We propose to address these challenges by using the implicit geometric knowledge embedded in the latent space of a large 4D reconstruction model to condition the video generation process. These latents capture scene structure in a continuous space without explicit reconstruction. Therefore, they provide a flexible representation that allows the pretrained diffusion prior to regularize errors more effectively. By jointly conditioning on these latents and source camera poses, we demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art results on the video re-rendering task.

| **[Can the Waymo Open Motion Dataset Support Realistic Behavioral Modeling? A Validation Study with Naturalistic Trajectories](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03515v2)** | 2026-01-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD) has become a popular resource for data-driven modeling of autonomous vehicles (AVs) behavior. However, its validity for behavioral analysis remains uncertain due to proprietary post-processing, the absence of error quantification, and the segmentation of trajectories into 20-second clips. This study examines whether WOMD accurately captures the dynamics and interactions observed in real-world AV operations. Leveraging an independently collected naturalistic dataset from Level 4 AV operations in Phoenix, Arizona (PHX), we perform comparative analyses across three representative urban driving scenarios: discharging at signalized intersections, car-following, and lane-changing behaviors. For the discharging analysis, headways are manually extracted from aerial video to ensure negligible measurement error. For the car-following and lane-changing cases, we apply the Simulation-Extrapolation (SIMEX) method to account for empirically estimated error in the PHX data and use Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) distances to quantify behavioral differences. Results across all scenarios consistently show that behavior in PHX falls outside the behavioral envelope of WOMD. Notably, WOMD underrepresents short headways and abrupt decelerations. These findings suggest that behavioral models calibrated solely on WOMD may systematically underestimate the variability, risk, and complexity of naturalistic driving. Caution is therefore warranted when using WOMD for behavior modeling without proper validation against independently collected data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fast Surrogate Models for Adaptive Aircraft Trajectory Prediction in En route Airspace](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03075v2)** | 2026-01-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction (TP) is crucial for ensuring safety and efficiency in modern air traffic management systems. It is, for example, a core component of conflict detection and resolution tools, arrival sequencing algorithms, capacity planning, as well as several future concepts. However, TP accuracy within operational systems is hampered by a range of epistemic uncertainties such as the mass and performance settings of aircraft and the effect of meteorological conditions on aircraft performance. It can also require considerable computational resources. This paper proposes a method for adaptive TP that has two components: first, a fast surrogate TP model based on linear state space models (LSSM)s with an execution time that was 6.7 times lower on average than an implementation of the Base of Aircraft Data (BADA) in Python. It is demonstrated that such models can effectively emulate the BADA aircraft performance model, which is based on the numerical solution of a partial differential equation (PDE), and that the LSSMs can be fitted to trajectories in a dataset of historic flight data. Secondly, the paper proposes an algorithm to assimilate radar observations using particle filtering to adaptively refine TP accuracy. Comparison with baselines using BADA and Kalman filtering demonstrate that the proposed framework improves system identification and state estimation for both climb and descent phases, with 46.3% and 64.7% better estimates for time to top of climb and bottom of descent compared to the best performing benchmark model. In particular, the particle filtering approach provides the flexibility to capture non-linear performance effects including the CAS-Mach transition.</p></details> |  |

Popular approaches such as reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) and inference-time reward aggregation are typically analyzed from a performance perspective, leaving their effects on the underlying reasoning distribution less understood. In this work, we study post-training reasoning from a stochastic trajectory viewpoint. Following Kim et al. (2025), we model reasoning steps of varying difficulty as Markov transitions with different probabilities, and formalize reasoning processes using tree-structured Markov chains. Within this framework, pretraining corresponds to discovering the reasoning structure, while post-training primarily reweights existing chains of thought. We show that both RLVR and inference-time reward aggregation concentrate probability mass on a small number of high-probability trajectories, leading to the suppression of rare but essential reasoning paths. As a consequence, solving hard instances often depends on low-probability trajectories already present in the base model. We further prove that exploration-oriented mechanisms, such as rejecting easy instances and applying KL regularization, help preserve these rare trajectories. Empirical simulations support our theoretical analysis.</p></details> |  |

Developing accurate prediction algorithms relies on reliable, multimodal, and realistic datasets; however, such datasets for roundabout scenarios are scarce, as real-world data collection is often limited by incomplete observations and entangled factors that are difficult to isolate. We present CARLA-Round, a systematically designed simulation dataset for roundabout trajectory prediction. The dataset varies weather conditions (five types) and traffic density levels (spanning Level-of-Service A-E) in a structured manner, resulting in 25 controlled scenarios. Each scenario incorporates realistic mixtures of driving behaviors and provides explicit annotations that are largely absent from existing datasets. Unlike randomly sampled simulation data, this structured design enables precise analysis of how different conditions influence trajectory prediction performance. Validation experiments using standard baselines (LSTM, GCN, GRU+GCN) reveal traffic density dominates prediction difficulty with strong monotonic effects, while weather shows non-linear impacts. The best model achieves 0.312m ADE on real-world rounD dataset, demonstrating effective sim-to-real transfer. This systematic approach quantifies factor impacts impossible to isolate in confounded real-world datasets.

To solve this problem, we propose a Curriculum-Guided Feature Learning and Three-Stage Attention Network (CL3AN-GNN), a learning network that uses a three-step attention system (Engage, Enact, Embed) similar to how humans learn. The model begins by engaging with structurally simpler features, defined as (1) local neighbourhood patterns (1-hop), (2) low-degree node attributes, and (3) class-separable node pairs identified via initial graph convolutional networks and graph attention networks (GCN and GAT) embeddings. This foundation enables stable early learning despite label skew. The Enact stage then addresses complicated aspects: (1) connections that require multiple steps, (2) edges that connect different types of nodes, and (3) nodes at the edges of minority classes by using adjustable attention weights. Finally, Embed consolidates these features via iterative message passing and curriculum-aligned loss weighting. We evaluate CL3AN-GNN on eight Open Graph Benchmark datasets spanning social, biological, and citation networks. Experiments show consistent improvements across all datasets in accuracy, F1-score, and AUC over recent state-of-the-art methods. The model's step-by-step method works well with different types of graph datasets, showing quicker results than training everything at once, better performance on new, imbalanced graphs, and clear explanations of each step using gradient stability and attention correlation learning curves. This work provides both a theoretically grounded framework for curriculum learning in GNNs and practical evidence of its effectiveness against imbalances, validated through metrics, convergence speeds, and generalisation tests.</p></details> |  |
| **[Data-Driven Graph Filters via Adaptive Spectral Shaping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03698v1)** | 2026-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce Adaptive Spectral Shaping, a data-driven framework for graph filtering that learns a reusable baseline spectral kernel and modulates it with a small set of Gaussian factors. The resulting multi-peak, multi-scale responses allocate energy to heterogeneous regions of the Laplacian spectrum while remaining interpretable via explicit centers and bandwidths. To scale, we implement filters with Chebyshev polynomial expansions, avoiding eigendecompositions. We further propose Transferable Adaptive Spectral Shaping (TASS): the baseline kernel is learned on source graphs and, on a target graph, kept fixed while only the shaping parameters are adapted, enabling few-shot transfer under matched compute. Across controlled synthetic benchmarks spanning graph families and signal regimes, Adaptive Spectral Shaping reduces reconstruction error relative to fixed-prototype wavelets and learned linear banks, and TASS yields consistent positive transfer. The framework provides compact spectral modules that plug into graph signal processing pipelines and graph neural networks, combining scalability, interpretability, and cross-graph generalization.</p></details> |  |

The inclusion of all these mechanisms has been first demonstrated in small systems, composed of a few atoms, before being scaled up to larger structures made of thousands of atoms. Also, the accuracy of the models has kept improving, from empirical to fully ab-initio ones, e.g., density functional theory (DFT). This paper summarizes key (algorithmic) achievements that have allowed us to bring DFT+NEGF simulations closer to the dimensions and functionality of realistic systems. The possibility of leveraging graph neural networks and machine learning to speed up ab-initio device simulations is discussed as well.</p></details> |  |
| **[SPGCL: Simple yet Powerful Graph Contrastive Learning via SVD-Guided Structural Perturbation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00064v2)** | 2026-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are sensitive to structural noise from adversarial attacks or imperfections. Existing graph contrastive learning (GCL) methods typically rely on either random perturbations (e.g., edge dropping) for diversity or spectral augmentations (e.g., SVD) to preserve structural priors. However, random perturbations are structure-agnostic and may remove critical edges, while SVD-based views often lack sufficient diversity. Integrating these paradigms is challenging as they operate on discrete edge removal and continuous matrix factorization, respectively.We propose SPGCL, a framework for robust GCL via SVD-guided structural perturbation. Leveraging a recently developed SVD-based method that generalizes structural perturbation theory to arbitrary graphs, we design a two-stage strategy: (1) lightweight stochastic edge removal to inject diversity, and (2) truncated SVD to derive a structure-aware scoring matrix for sparse top-$P$ edge recovery. This integration offers three advantages: (1) Robustness to accidental deletion, as important edges can be recovered by SVD-guided scoring; (2) Enrichment with missing links, creating more informative contrastive views by introducing semantically meaningful edges; and (3) Controllable structural discrepancy, ensuring contrastive signals stem from semantic differences rather than edge-number gaps.Furthermore, we incorporate a contrastive fusion module with a global similarity constraint to align embeddings. Extensive experiments on ten benchmark datasets demonstrate that SPGCL consistently improves the robustness and accuracy of GNNs, outperforming state-of-the-art GCL and structure learning methods, validating its effectiveness in integrating previously disparate paradigms.</p></details> |  |

The architecture of GTs typically integrates Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with global attention mechanisms either in parallel or as a precursor to attention mechanisms, yielding a local-and-global or local-to-global attention scheme. However, as the global attention mechanism primarily captures long-range dependencies between nodes, these integration schemes may suffer from information loss, where the local neighborhood information learned by GNN could be diluted by the attention mechanism. Therefore, we propose G2LFormer, featuring a novel global-to-local attention scheme where the shallow network layers use attention mechanisms to capture global information, while the deeper layers employ GNN modules to learn local structural information, thereby preventing nodes from ignoring their immediate neighbors. An effective cross-layer information fusion strategy is introduced to allow local layers to retain beneficial information from global layers and alleviate information loss, with acceptable trade-offs in scalability. To validate the feasibility of the global-to-local attention scheme, we compare G2LFormer with state-of-the-art linear GTs and GNNs on node-level and graph-level tasks. The results indicate that G2LFormer exhibits excellent performance while keeping linear complexity.</p></details> | <details><summary>The a...</summary><p>The article has been accepted by Frontiers of Computer Science (FCS), with the DOI: {10.1007/s11704-026-51718-4}</p></details> |
| **[GraphAllocBench: A Flexible Benchmark for Preference-Conditioned Multi-Objective Policy Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20753v3)** | 2026-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Preference-Conditioned Policy Learning (PCPL) in Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning (MORL) aims to approximate diverse Pareto-optimal solutions by conditioning policies on user-specified preferences over objectives. This enables a single model to flexibly adapt to arbitrary trade-offs at run-time by producing a policy on or near the Pareto front. However, existing benchmarks for PCPL are largely restricted to toy tasks and fixed environments, limiting their realism and scalability. To address this gap, we introduce GraphAllocBench, a flexible benchmark built on a novel graph-based resource allocation sandbox environment inspired by city management, which we call CityPlannerEnv. GraphAllocBench provides a rich suite of problems with diverse objective functions, varying preference conditions, and high-dimensional scalability. We also propose two new evaluation metrics -- Proportion of Non-Dominated Solutions (PNDS) and Ordering Score (OS) -- that directly capture preference consistency while complementing the widely used hypervolume metric. Through experiments with Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) and graph-aware models, we show that GraphAllocBench exposes the limitations of existing MORL approaches and paves the way for using graph-based methods such as Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in complex, high-dimensional combinatorial allocation tasks. Beyond its predefined problem set, GraphAllocBench enables users to flexibly vary objectives, preferences, and allocation rules, establishing it as a versatile and extensible benchmark for advancing PCPL.

Traditional bot mitigation techniques, including IP blacklists and CAPTCHA-based challenges, are increasingly ineffective or intrusive, as modern bots leverage proxies, botnets, and AI-assisted evasion strategies. This work proposes a non-intrusive graph-based bot detection framework for e-commerce that models user session behavior through a graph representation and applies an inductive graph neural network for classification. The approach captures both relational structure and behavioral semantics, enabling accurate identification of subtle automated activity that evades feature-based methods. Experiments on real-world e-commerce traffic demonstrate that the proposed inductive graph model outperforms a strong session-level multilayer perceptron baseline in terms of AUC and F1 score. Additional adversarial perturbation and cold-start simulations show that the model remains robust under moderate graph modifications and generalizes effectively to previously unseen sessions and URLs. The proposed framework is deployment-friendly, integrates with existing systems without client-side instrumentation, and supports real-time inference and incremental updates, making it suitable for practical e-commerce security deployments.</p></details> |  |

Previous graph neural network (GNN) models leverage molecular structures and interaction networks but mostly rely on linear aggregation and symmetric assumptions, limiting their ability to capture nonlinear and heterogeneous patterns. We propose MGKAN, a Graph Kolmogorov-Arnold Network that introduces learnable basis functions into asymmetric DDI prediction. MGKAN replaces conventional MLP transformations with KAN-driven basis functions, enabling more expressive and nonlinear modeling of drug relationships. To capture pharmacological dependencies, MGKAN integrates three network views-an asymmetric DDI network, a co-interaction network, and a biochemical similarity network-with role-specific embeddings to preserve directional semantics. A fusion module combines linear attention and nonlinear transformation to enhance representational capacity. On two benchmark datasets, MGKAN outperforms seven state-of-the-art baselines. Ablation studies and case studies confirm its predictive accuracy and effectiveness in modeling directional drug effects.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted by ICASSP 2026</p></details> |
| **[Fast Task Planning with Neuro-Symbolic Relaxation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15975v2)** | 2026-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-world task planning requires long-horizon reasoning over large sets of objects with complex relationships and attributes, leading to a combinatorial explosion for classical symbolic planners. To prune the search space, recent methods prioritize searching on a simplified task only containing a few ``important" objects predicted by a neural network. However, such a simple neuro-symbolic (NeSy) integration risks omitting critical objects and wasting resources on unsolvable simplified tasks. To enable Fast and reliable planning, we introduce a NeSy relaxation strategy (Flax), combining neural importance prediction with symbolic expansion. Specifically, we first learn a graph neural network to predict object importance to create a simplified task and solve it with a symbolic planner. Then, we solve a rule-relaxed task to obtain a quick rough plan, and reintegrate all referenced objects into the simplified task to recover any overlooked but essential elements. Finally, we apply complementary rules to refine the updated task, keeping it both reliable and compact. Extensive experiments are conducted on both synthetic and real-world maze navigation benchmarks where a robot must traverse through a maze and interact with movable obstacles. The results show that Flax boosts the average success rate by 20.82\% and cuts mean wall-clock planning time by 17.65\% compared with the state-of-the-art NeSy baseline. We expect that Flax offers a practical path toward fast, scalable, long-horizon task planning in complex environments.</p></details> | 8 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Multi-view Graph Condensation via Tensor Decomposition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14330v2)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated remarkable results in various real-world applications, including drug discovery, object detection, social media analysis, recommender systems, and text classification. In contrast to their vast potential, training them on large-scale graphs presents significant computational challenges due to the resources required for their storage and processing. Graph Condensation has emerged as a promising solution to reduce these demands by learning a synthetic compact graph that preserves the essential information of the original one while maintaining the GNN's predictive performance. Despite their efficacy, current graph condensation approaches frequently rely on a computationally intensive bi-level optimization. Moreover, they fail to maintain a mapping between synthetic and original nodes, limiting the interpretability of the model's decisions. In this sense, a wide range of decomposition techniques have been applied to learn linear or multi-linear functions from graph data, offering a more transparent and less resource-intensive alternative. However, their applicability to graph condensation remains unexplored. This paper addresses this gap and proposes a novel method called Multi-view Graph Condensation via Tensor Decomposition (GCTD) to investigate to what extent such techniques can synthesize an informative smaller graph and achieve comparable downstream task performance. Extensive experiments on six real-world datasets demonstrate that GCTD effectively reduces graph size while preserving GNN performance, achieving up to a 4.0\ improvement in accuracy on three out of six datasets and competitive performance on large graphs compared to existing approaches.

Our construction generalizes the Goldreich-Micali-Wigderson zero-knowledge protocol to arbitrary k >= 3, applies the Fiat-Shamir transform, and uses Merkle-tree commitments to compress signatures from O(tn) to O(t log n). Crucially, we generate hard instances via planted "quiet" colorings that preserve the statistical profile of random graphs. We present the first empirical security analysis of such a scheme against both classical solvers (ILP, DSatur) and a custom graph neural network (GNN) attacker. Experiments show that for n >= 60, neither approach recovers the secret coloring, demonstrating that well-engineered k-coloring instances can resist modern cryptanalysis, including machine learning. This revives combinatorial hardness as a credible foundation for post-quantum signatures.</p></details> | 23 pages, 5 figures |

Building on GraphRAG, we construct a domain-specific knowledge graph and retrieve query-relevant subgraphs to provide relational evidence during answer generation. The framework adopts ChatGLM as the Transformer backbone with LoRA-based parameter-efficient fine-tuning, and employs a graph neural network to learn node representations that capture symptom-disease-treatment dependencies. By explicitly modeling diseases, symptoms, pesticides, and control measures as linked entities, the system supports evidence-aware retrieval beyond surface-level text similarity. Retrieved graph evidence is incorporated into the LLM input to guide generation toward domain-consistent recommendations and to mitigate hallucinated or inappropriate treatments. Experimental results show consistent improvements over text-only baselines, with the largest gains observed on multi-hop and comparative reasoning questions that require chaining multiple relations.</p></details> |  |

We propose a robust SASV framework in which a spoofing detector and a speaker verification (SV) network operate in tandem. The spoofing detector employs a self-supervised speech embedding extractor as the frontend, combined with a state-of-the-art graph neural network backend. In addition, a top-3 layer based mixture-of-experts (MoE) is used to fuse high-level and low-level features for effective spoofed utterance detection. For speaker verification, we adapt a low-complexity convolutional neural network that fuses 2D and 1D features at multiple scales, trained with the SphereFace loss. Additionally, contrastive circle loss is applied to adaptively weight positive and negative pairs within each training batch, enabling the network to better distinguish between hard and easy sample pairs. Finally, fixed imposter cohort based AS Norm score normalization and model ensembling are used to further enhance the discriminative capability of the speaker verification system.</p></details> |  |

We propose \textbf{PIMPC-GNN}, a physics-informed multi-phase consensus framework for imbalanced node classification. Our method integrates three complementary dynamics: (i) thermodynamic diffusion, which spreads minority labels to capture long-range dependencies, (ii) Kuramoto synchronisation, which aligns minority nodes through oscillatory consensus, and (iii) spectral embedding, which separates classes via structural regularisation. These perspectives are combined through class-adaptive ensemble weighting and trained with an imbalance-aware loss that couples balanced cross-entropy with physics-based constraints. Across five benchmark datasets and imbalance ratios from 5-100, PIMPC-GNN outperforms 16 state-of-the-art baselines, achieving notable gains in minority-class recall (up to +12.7\%) and balanced accuracy (up to +8.3\%). Beyond empirical improvements, the framework also provides interpretable insights into consensus dynamics in graph learning.

Grappa is a distributed GNN training framework that enforces gradient-only communication: during each iteration, partitions train in isolation and exchange only gradients for the global update. To recover accuracy lost to isolation, Grappa (i) periodically repartitions to expose new neighborhoods and (ii) applies a lightweight coverage-corrected gradient aggregation inspired by importance sampling. We prove the corrected estimator is asymptotically unbiased under standard support and boundedness assumptions, and we derive a batch-level variant for compatibility with common deep-learning packages that minimizes mean-squared deviation from the ideal node-level correction. We also introduce a shrinkage version that improves stability in practice. Empirical results on real and synthetic graphs show that Grappa trains GNNs 4 times faster on average (up to 13 times) than state-of-the-art systems, achieves better accuracy especially for deeper models, and sustains training at the trillion-edge scale on commodity hardware. Grappa is model-agnostic, supports full-graph and mini-batch training, and does not rely on high-bandwidth interconnects or caching.</p></details> |  |

We focus on classes of pointed Kripke models that are invariant under bounded unravellings, a natural locality condition satisfied by modal logics and by graph neural networks (GNNs). We show that preservation under embeddings coincides with definability in existential graded modal logic; preservation under injective homomorphisms with definability in existential positive graded modal logic; and preservation under homomorphisms with definability in existential positive modal logic. A key technical contribution is a structural well-quasi-ordering result. We prove that the embedding relation on classes of tree-shaped models of uniformly bounded height forms a well-quasi-order, and that the bounded-height assumption is essential. This well-quasi-ordering yields a finite minimal-tree argument leading to explicit syntactic characterisations via finite disjunctions of (graded) modal formulae. As an application, we derive consequences for the expressive power of GNNs. Using our preservation theorem for injective homomorphisms, we obtain a new logical characterisation of monotonic GNNs, showing that they capture exactly existential-positive graded modal logic, while monotonic GNNs with MAX aggregation correspond precisely to existential-positive modal logic.</p></details> | 13 pages |

Based on this observation, Hyperbolic Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs) have been widely adopted as a principled choice for representation learning on tree-like graphs. In this work, we question this paradigm by proposing an additional condition of geometry-task alignment, i.e., whether the metric structure of the target follows that of the input graph. We theoretically and empirically demonstrate the capability of HGNNs to recover low-distortion representations on two synthetic regression problems, and show that their geometric inductive bias becomes helpful when the problem requires preserving metric structure. Additionally, we evaluate HGNNs on the tasks of link prediction and node classification by jointly analyzing predictive performance and embedding distortion, revealing that only link prediction is geometry-aligned. Overall, our findings shift the focus from only asking "Is the graph hyperbolic?" to also questioning "Is the task aligned with hyperbolic geometry?", showing that HGNNs consistently outperform Euclidean models under such alignment, while their advantage vanishes otherwise.</p></details> |  |

While previous research has addressed dataset limitations and explored various approaches including Open-Vocabulary settings, they frequently fail to optimize the representational capacity of object and relationship features, showing excessive reliance on Graph Neural Networks despite insufficient discriminative capability. In this work, we demonstrate through extensive analysis that the quality of object features plays a critical role in determining overall scene graph accuracy. To address this challenge, we design a highly discriminative object feature encoder and employ a contrastive pretraining strategy that decouples object representation learning from the scene graph prediction. This design not only enhances object classification accuracy but also yields direct improvements in relationship prediction. Notably, when plugging in our pretrained encoder into existing frameworks, we observe substantial performance improvements across all evaluation metrics. Additionally, whereas existing approaches have not fully exploited the integration of relationship information, we effectively combine both geometric and semantic features to achieve superior relationship prediction. Comprehensive experiments on the 3DSSG dataset demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods.

While Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are the standard solution, state-of-the-art pipelines often rely on explicit structural heuristics or memory-intensive node embeddings -- approaches that struggle to generalize or scale to massive graphs. Emerging Graph Transformers (GTs) offer a potential alternative but often incur significant overhead due to complex structural encodings, hindering their applications to large-scale link prediction. We challenge these sophisticated paradigms with PENCIL, an encoder-only plain Transformer that replaces hand-crafted priors with attention over sampled local subgraphs, retaining the scalability and hardware efficiency of standard Transformers. Through experimental and theoretical analysis, we show that PENCIL extracts richer structural signals than GNNs, implicitly generalizing a broad class of heuristics and subgraph-based expressivity. Empirically, PENCIL outperforms heuristic-informed GNNs and is far more parameter-efficient than ID-embedding--based alternatives, while remaining competitive across diverse benchmarks -- even without node features. Our results challenge the prevailing reliance on complex engineering techniques, demonstrating that simple design choices are potentially sufficient to achieve the same capabilities.</p></details> |  |

Despite their widespread use, implementing them efficiently over large vocabularies remains a significant challenge. Existing approaches often rely on sorting, which incur significant computation and memory overhead on GPUs, or stochastic approaches, which alter the algorithm output. In this work, we propose Qrita, an efficient Top-k and Top-p algorithm based on a pivot-based selection strategy. Based on RTop-k, which uses a pivot-based search for node selection in graph neural networks, Qrita extends the concept of pivot-based search to both Top-k and Top-p with two key techniques: 1. Gaussian-based sigma-truncation, which greatly reduces the search space of the target elements, and 2. Quaternary pivot search with duplication handling, which halves the pivot search iteration and guarantees deterministic output. We provide the full implementation of Qrita using Triton, a popular GPU programming language. Our evaluation of Qrita against the Top-k and Top-p kernels of high performance LLM execution engines such as vLLM, SGLang, and Flashinfer show that Qrita achieves up to 2 times throughput and half memory use while providing the same output to the the sorting-based algorithms.</p></details> |  |

Although many platforms attempt to curb incivility through moderation and automated detection, the performance of existing approaches often remains limited in both accuracy and efficiency. To address this challenge, we propose a Graph Neural Network (GNN) framework for detecting three types of uncivil behavior (i.e., toxicity, aggression, and personal attacks) within the English Wikipedia community. Our model represents each user comment as a node, with textual similarity between comments defining the edges, allowing the network to jointly learn from both linguistic content and relational structures among comments. We also introduce a dynamically adjusted attention mechanism that adaptively balances nodal and topological features during information aggregation. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our proposed architecture outperforms 12 state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs) across multiple metrics while requiring significantly lower inference cost. These findings highlight the crucial role of structural context in detecting online incivility and address the limitations of text-only LLM paradigms in behavioral prediction. All datasets and comparative outputs will be publicly available in our repository to support further research and reproducibility.</p></details> | 10 pages |

Spiking neural networks offer event-driven efficiency but remain limited by sequential propagation, binary information loss, and local aggregation that misses global context. We propose ChronoSpike, an adaptive spiking graph neural network that integrates learnable LIF neurons with per-channel membrane dynamics, multi-head attentive spatial aggregation on continuous features, and a lightweight Transformer temporal encoder, enabling both fine-grained local modeling and long-range dependency capture with linear memory complexity $O(T \cdot d)$. On three large-scale benchmarks, ChronoSpike outperforms twelve state-of-the-art baselines by $2.0\%$ Macro-F1 and $2.4\%$ Micro-F1 while achieving $3-10\times$ faster training than recurrent methods with a constant 105K-parameter budget independent of graph size. We provide theoretical guarantees for membrane potential boundedness, gradient flow stability under contraction factor $ρ< 1$, and BIBO stability; interpretability analyses reveal heterogeneous temporal receptive fields and a learned primacy effect with $83-88\%$ sparsity.</p></details> |  |
| **[Single-Edge Node Injection Threats to GNN-Based Security Monitoring in Industrial Graph Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01113v1)** | 2026-02-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) are increasingly adopted in industrial graph-based monitoring systems (e.g., Industrial internet of things (IIoT) device graphs, power-grid topology models, and manufacturing communication networks) to support anomaly detection, state estimation, and asset classification. In such settings, an adversary that compromises a small number of edge devices may inject counterfeit nodes (e.g., rogue sensors, virtualized endpoints, or spoofed substations) to bias downstream decisions while evading topology- and homophily-based sanitization. This paper formulates deployment-oriented node-injection attacks under constrained resources and proposes the \emph{Single-Edge Graph Injection Attack} (SEGIA), in which each injected node attaches to the operational graph through a single edge. SEGIA integrates a pruned SGC surrogate, multi-hop neighborhood sampling, and reverse graph convolution-based feature synthesis with a similarity-regularized objective to preserve local homophily and survive edge pruning. Theoretical analysis and extensive evaluations across datasets and defenses show at least $25\%$ higher attack success than representative baselines under substantially smaller edge budgets. These results indicate a system-level risk in industrial GNN deployments and motivate lightweight admission validation and neighborhood-consistency monitoring.</p></details> |  |

Yet discovering GPCR modulators remains challenging because receptor activation often arises from complex allosteric effects rather than direct binding affinity, and conventional assays are slow, costly, and not optimized for capturing these dynamics. Here we present GPCR-Filter, a deep learning framework specifically developed for GPCR modulator discovery. We assembled a high-quality dataset of over 90,000 experimentally validated GPCR-ligand pairs, providing a robust foundation for training and evaluation. GPCR-Filter integrates the ESM-3 protein language model for high-fidelity GPCR sequence representations with graph neural networks that encode ligand structures, coupled through an attention-based fusion mechanism that learns receptor-ligand functional relationships. Across multiple evaluation settings, GPCR-Filter consistently outperforms state-of-the-art compound-protein interaction models and exhibits strong generalization to unseen receptors and ligands. Notably, the model successfully identified micromolar-level agonists of the 5-HT\textsubscript{1A} receptor with distinct chemical frameworks. These results establish GPCR-Filter as a scalable and effective computational approach for GPCR modulator discovery, advancing AI-assisted drug development for complex signaling systems.</p></details> |  |

In the past few years, rapid developments of machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) have offered a solution to scale up quantum mechanical calculations. Parallelizing these interatomic potentials across multiple devices poses a challenging, but promising approach to further extending simulation scales to real-world applications. In this work, we present DistMLIP, an efficient distributed inference platform for MLIPs based on zero-redundancy, graph-level parallelization. In contrast to conventional spatial partitioning parallelization, DistMLIP enables efficient MLIP parallelization through graph partitioning, allowing multi-device inference on flexible MLIP model architectures like multi-layer graph neural networks. DistMLIP presents an easy-to-use, flexible, plug-in interface that enables distributed inference of pre-existing MLIPs. We demonstrate DistMLIP on four widely used and state-of-the-art MLIPs: CHGNet, MACE, TensorNet, and eSEN. We show that DistMLIP can simulate atomic systems 3.4x larger and up to 8x faster compared to previous multi-GPU methods. We show that existing foundation potentials can perform near-million-atom calculations at the scale of a few seconds on 8 GPUs with DistMLIP.</p></details> | ICLR 2026 |

Focusing on the Travelling Salesman Problem, we show that encoding global structural constraints as an inductive bias enables a non-autoregressive model to generate solutions via direct forward passes, without search, supervision, or sequential decision-making. At inference time, dropout and snapshot ensembling allow a single model to act as an implicit ensemble, reducing optimality gaps through increased solution diversity. Our results establish that graph neural networks do not require supervised training nor explicit search to be effective. Instead, they can internalize global combinatorial structure and function as strong, learned heuristics. This reframes the role of learning in combinatorial optimization: from augmenting classical algorithms to directly instantiating new heuristics.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 3 tables with 2 figures, code repo included in the manuscript</p></details> |
| **[Towards Multiscale Graph-based Protein Learning with Geometric Secondary Structural Motifs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00862v1)** | 2026-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful tools for learning protein structures by capturing spatial relationships at the residue level. However, existing GNN-based methods often face challenges in learning multiscale representations and modeling long-range dependencies efficiently. In this work, we propose an efficient multiscale graph-based learning framework tailored to proteins. Our proposed framework contains two crucial components: (1) It constructs a hierarchical graph representation comprising a collection of fine-grained subgraphs, each corresponding to a secondary structure motif (e.g., $α$-helices, $β$-strands, loops), and a single coarse-grained graph that connects these motifs based on their spatial arrangement and relative orientation. (2) It employs two GNNs for feature learning: the first operates within individual secondary motifs to capture local interactions, and the second models higher-level structural relationships across motifs. Our modular framework allows a flexible choice of GNN in each stage. Theoretically, we show that our hierarchical framework preserves the desired maximal expressiveness, ensuring no loss of critical structural information. Empirically, we demonstrate that integrating baseline GNNs into our multiscale framework remarkably improves prediction accuracy and reduces computational cost across various benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

We introduce AutoGNN, an FPGA-based accelerator designed to address these challenges by leveraging FPGA's reconfigurability and specialized components. AutoGNN adapts to diverse graph inputs, efficiently performing computationally intensive tasks such as graph conversion and sampling. By utilizing components like adder trees, AutoGNN executes reduction operations in constant time, overcoming the limitations of serialization and synchronization on GPUs. AutoGNN integrates unified processing elements (UPEs) and single-cycle reducers (SCRs) to streamline GNN preprocessing. UPEs enable scalable parallel processing for edge sorting and unique vertex selection, while SCRs efficiently handle sequential tasks such as pointer array construction and subgraph reindexing. A user-level software framework dynamically profiles graph inputs, determines optimal configurations, and reprograms AutoGNN to handle varying workloads. Implemented on a 7$n$m enterprise FPGA, AutoGNN achieves up to 9.0$\times$ and 2.1$\times$ speedup compared to conventional and GPU-accelerated preprocessing systems, respectively, enabling high-performance GNN preprocessing across diverse datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[When LLM Agents Meet Graph Optimization: An Automated Data Quality Improvement Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08952v3)** | 2026-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-attributed graphs (TAGs) have become a key form of graph-structured data in modern data management and analytics, combining structural relationships with rich textual semantics for diverse applications. However, the effectiveness of analytical models, particularly graph neural networks (GNNs), is highly sensitive to data quality. Our empirical analysis shows that both conventional and LLM-enhanced GNNs degrade notably under textual, structural, and label imperfections, underscoring TAG quality as a key bottleneck for reliable analytics. Existing studies have explored data-level optimization for TAGs, but most focus on specific degradation types and target a single aspect like structure or label, lacking a systematic and comprehensive perspective on data quality improvement. To address this gap, we propose LAGA (Large Language and Graph Agent), a unified multi-agent framework for comprehensive TAG quality optimization. LAGA formulates graph quality control as a data-centric process, integrating detection, planning, action, and evaluation agents into an automated loop. It holistically enhances textual, structural, and label aspects through coordinated multi-modal optimization. Extensive experiments on 5 datasets and 16 baselines across 9 scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness, robustness and scalability of LAGA, confirming the importance of data-centric quality optimization for reliable TAG analytics.</p></details> | 12 pages, 10figures |

A key challenge is the severe lack of training data, as many properties are too complicated to calculate with high-throughput first principles techniques. To address this, recent research has created experimental databases from information extracted from scientific literature. However, most existing experimental databases do not provide full atomic coordinate information, which prevents them from supporting advanced ML architectures such as Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). In this work, we propose to bridge this gap through an alignment process between experimental databases and Crystallographic Information Files (CIF) from the Inorganic Crystal Structure Database (ICSD). Our approach enables the creation of a database that can fully leverage state-of-the-art model architectures for material property prediction. It also opens the door to utilizing transfer learning to improve prediction accuracy. To validate our approach, we align NEMAD with the ICSD and compare models trained on the resulting database to those trained on NEMAD originally. We demonstrate significant improvements in both Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Correct Classification Rate (CCR) in predicting the ordering temperatures and magnetic ground states of magnetic materials, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 3 figures, 1 table, submitted to Journal of Magnetism and Magnetic Materials</p></details> |

| **[Kernelized Edge Attention: Addressing Semantic Attention Blurring in Temporal Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00596v1)** | 2026-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal Graph Neural Networks (TGNNs) aim to capture the evolving structure and timing of interactions in dynamic graphs. Although many models incorporate time through encodings or architectural design, they often compute attention over entangled node and edge representations, failing to reflect their distinct temporal behaviors. Node embeddings evolve slowly as they aggregate long-term structural context, while edge features reflect transient, timestamped interactions (e.g. messages, trades, or transactions). This mismatch results in semantic attention blurring, where attention weights cannot distinguish between slowly drifting node states and rapidly changing, information-rich edge interactions. As a result, models struggle to capture fine-grained temporal dependencies and provide limited transparency into how temporal relevance is computed. This paper introduces KEAT (Kernelized Edge Attention for Temporal Graphs), a novel attention formulation that modulates edge features using a family of continuous-time kernels, including Laplacian, RBF, and learnable MLP variant. KEAT preserves the distinct roles of nodes and edges, and integrates seamlessly with both Transformer-style (e.g., DyGFormer) and message-passing (e.g., TGN) architectures. It achieves up to 18% MRR improvement over the recent DyGFormer and 7% over TGN on link prediction tasks, enabling more accurate, interpretable and temporally aware message passing in TGNNs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at AAAI 2026</p></details> |

We present a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) embedding framework that integrates graph neural network representations with dynamically retrieved literature-derived knowledge through contrastive learning. Benchmarking against ten embedding methods reveals task-specific complementarity: topology-focused methods achieve near-perfect link prediction (GCN: 0.983 AUROC), while RAG-GNN is the only method achieving positive silhouette scores for functional clustering (0.001 vs. negative scores for all baselines). Information-theoretic decomposition shows network topology contributes 77.3% of predictive information, while retrieved documents provide 8.6% unique information. Applied to cancer signaling networks (379 proteins, 3,498 interactions), the framework identifies DDR1 as a therapeutic target based on retrieved evidence of synthetic lethality with KRAS mutations. These results establish that topology-only and retrieval-augmented approaches serve complementary purposes: structural prediction tasks are solved by network topology alone, while functional interpretation uniquely benefits from retrieved knowledge.</p></details> |  |
| **[FloydNet: A Learning Paradigm for Global Relational Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19094v2)** | 2026-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Developing models capable of complex, multi-step reasoning is a central goal in artificial intelligence. While representing problems as graphs is a powerful approach, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are fundamentally constrained by their message-passing mechanism, which imposes a local bottleneck that limits global, holistic reasoning. We argue that dynamic programming (DP), which solves problems by iteratively refining a global state, offers a more powerful and suitable learning paradigm. We introduce FloydNet, a new architecture that embodies this principle. In contrast to local message passing, FloydNet maintains a global, all-pairs relationship tensor and learns a generalized DP operator to progressively refine it. This enables the model to develop a task-specific relational calculus, providing a principled framework for capturing long-range dependencies. Theoretically, we prove that FloydNet achieves 3-WL (2-FWL) expressive power, and its generalized form aligns with the k-FWL hierarchy. FloydNet demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across challenging domains: it achieves near-perfect scores (often >99\%) on the CLRS-30 algorithmic benchmark, finds exact optimal solutions for the general Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) at rates significantly exceeding strong heuristics, and empirically matches the 3-WL test on the BREC benchmark. Our results establish this learned, DP-style refinement as a powerful and practical alternative to message passing for high-level graph reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>29 pa...</summary><p>29 pages, 9 figures, 14 tables</p></details> |

Although post-training model editing offers a pathway for dynamic updates, existing methods frequently suffer from overfitting and catastrophic forgetting. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel framework that leverages hyperbolic geometry and graph neural networks for precise and stable model edits. We introduce HYPE (HYperbolic Parameter Editing), which comprises three key components: (i) Hyperbolic Graph Construction, which uses Poincaré embeddings to represent knowledge triples in hyperbolic space, preserving hierarchical relationships and preventing unintended side effects by ensuring that edits to parent concepts do not inadvertently affect child concepts; (ii) Möbius-Transformed Updates, which apply hyperbolic addition to propagate edits while maintaining structural consistency within the hyperbolic manifold, unlike conventional Euclidean updates that distort relational distances; and (iii) Dual Stabilization, which combines gradient masking and periodic GNN parameter resetting to prevent catastrophic forgetting by focusing updates on critical parameters and preserving long-term knowledge. Experiments on CounterFact, CounterFact+, and MQuAKE with GPT-J and GPT2-XL demonstrate that HYPE significantly enhances edit stability, factual accuracy, and multi-hop reasoning.</p></details> |  |

However, the standalone GNNs can unleash threat surfaces and privacy implications, as some sensitive graph-structured data is collected and processed in a centralized setting. To solve this issue, Federated Graph Neural Networks (FedGNNs) are proposed to facilitate collaborative learning over decentralized local graph data, aiming to preserve user privacy. Yet, emerging research indicates that even in these settings, shared model updates, particularly gradients, can unintentionally leak sensitive information of local users. Numerous privacy inference attacks have been explored in traditional federated learning and extended to graph settings, but the problem of label distribution inference in FedGNNs remains largely underexplored. In this work, we introduce Fed-Listing (Federated Label Distribution Inference in GNNs), a novel gradient-based attack designed to infer the private label statistics of target clients in FedGNNs without access to raw data or node features. Fed-Listing only leverages the final-layer gradients exchanged during training to uncover statistical patterns that reveal class proportions in a stealthy manner. An auxiliary shadow dataset is used to generate diverse label partitioning strategies, simulating various client distributions, on which the attack model is obtained. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets and three GNN architectures show that Fed-Listing significantly outperforms existing baselines, including random guessing and Decaf, even under challenging non-i.i.d. scenarios. Moreover, applying defense mechanisms can barely reduce our attack performance, unless the model's utility is severely degraded.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 4 figures, and 5 tables</p></details> |

The two networks interact with each other at the layer level to find a saddle point of the Lagrangian. The primal GNN finds a stationary point for a given dual multiplier, while the dual network iteratively refines its estimates to reach an optimal solution. We force the primal and dual networks to mirror the dynamics of the DA algorithm by imposing descent and ascent constraints. We propose a joint training scheme that alternates between updating the primal and dual networks. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that our approach yields near-optimal near-feasible solutions and generalizes well to out-of-distribution (OOD) problems.</p></details> |  |

To address this threat, modern bot detectors increasingly rely on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). However, the effectiveness of these GNN-based detectors in real-world settings remains poorly understood. In practice, attackers continuously adapt their strategies as well as must operate under domain-specific and temporal constraints, which can fundamentally limit the applicability of existing attack methods. As a result, there is a critical need for robust GNN-based bot detection methods under realistic, constraint-aware attack scenarios. To address this gap, we introduce BOCLOAK to systematically evaluate the robustness of GNN-based social bot detection via both edge editing and node injection adversarial attacks under realistic constraints. BOCLOAK constructs a probability measure over spatio-temporal neighbor features and learns an optimal transport geometry that separates human and bot behaviors. It then decodes transport plans into sparse, plausible edge edits that evade detection while obeying real-world constraints. We evaluate BOCLOAK across three social bot datasets, five state-of-the-art bot detectors, three adversarial defenses, and compare it against four leading graph adversarial attack baselines. BOCLOAK achieves up to 80.13% higher attack success rates while using 99.80% less GPU memory under realistic real-world constraints. Most importantly, BOCLOAK shows that optimal transport provides a lightweight, principled framework for bridging the gap between adversarial attacks and real-world bot detection.</p></details> |  |
| **[Cooperative Sheaf Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00647v3)** | 2026-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sheaf diffusion has recently emerged as a promising design pattern for graph representation learning due to its inherent ability to handle heterophilic data and avoid oversmoothing. Meanwhile, cooperative message passing has also been proposed as a way to enhance the flexibility of information diffusion by allowing nodes to independently choose whether to propagate/gather information from/to neighbors. A natural question ensues: is sheaf diffusion capable of exhibiting this cooperative behavior? Here, we provide a negative answer to this question. In particular, we show that existing sheaf diffusion methods fail to achieve cooperative behavior due to the lack of message directionality. To circumvent this limitation, we introduce the notion of cellular sheaves over directed graphs and characterize their in- and out-degree Laplacians. We leverage our construction to propose Cooperative Sheaf Neural Networks (CSNNs). Theoretically, we characterize the receptive field of CSNN and show it allows nodes to selectively attend (listen) to arbitrarily far nodes while ignoring all others in their path, potentially mitigating oversquashing. Our experiments show that CSNN presents overall better performance compared to prior art on sheaf diffusion as well as cooperative graph neural networks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR 2026</p></details> |

In this work, we shift our attention to GNNs that perform message passing on edges and introduce EB-1WL, an edge-based color-refinement test, and a corresponding architecture, EB-GNN. Our EB-GNN architecture is inspired by the classic triangle-counting algorithm of Chiba and Nishizeki and passes messages along edges and triangles. Our contributions are as follows: (1) Theoretically, we show that EB-1WL is significantly more expressive than 1WL. We provide a complete logical characterization of EB-1WL in first-order logic, along with distinguishability results via homomorphism counting. To the best of our knowledge, EB-GNN has the strongest theoretical expressivity guarantees among edge-based message-passing GNNs in the literature. (2) Unlike many GNN architectures that are more expressive than 1WL, we prove that EB-1WL and EB-GNN admit near-linear time and memory usage on practical graph learning workloads. (3) We show in experiments that EB-GNN is a highly efficient general-purpose architecture: it substantially outperforms simple MPNNs and remains competitive with task-specialized state-of-the-art GNNs at substantially lower computational cost.</p></details> |  |

We partially address this gap for node regression with graph-based errors-in-variables models under simultaneous covariate and edge corruption: responses are generated from latent node-level covariates, but only noise-perturbed versions of the latent covariates are observed; and the sample graph is a random geometric graph created from the node covariates but contaminated by independent Erdős--Rényi edges. We propose and analyze a carefully designed, task-specific GAT that constructs denoised proxy features for regression. We prove that regressing the response variables on the proxies achieves lower error asymptotically in (a) estimating the regression coefficient compared to the ordinary least squares (OLS) estimator on the noisy node covariates, and (b) predicting the response for an unlabelled node compared to a vanilla graph convolutional network~(GCN) -- under mild growth conditions. Our analysis leverages high-dimensional geometric tail bounds and concentration for neighbourhood counts and sample covariances. We verify our theoretical findings through experiments on synthetically generated data. We also perform experiments on real-world graphs and demonstrate the effectiveness of the attention mechanism in several node regression tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>62 pa...</summary><p>62 pages, 2 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

Existing temporal graph neural networks mainly focus on learning representations of historical interactions. Despite their strong performance, these models are still purely discriminative, producing point estimates for future links and lacking an explicit mechanism to capture the uncertainty and sequential structure of future temporal interactions. In this paper, we propose SDG, a novel sequence-level diffusion framework that unifies dynamic graph learning with generative denoising. Specifically, SDG injects noise into the entire historical interaction sequence and jointly reconstructs all interaction embeddings through a conditional denoising process, thereby enabling the model to capture more comprehensive interaction distributions. To align the generative process with temporal link prediction, we employ a cross-attention denoising decoder to guide the reconstruction of the destination sequence and optimize the model in an end-to-end manner. Extensive experiments on various temporal graph benchmarks show that SDG consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance in the temporal link prediction task.</p></details> |  |

Rational design is often bottlenecked by the inability to predict how subtle changes in domain topology influence functional outcomes, a challenge exacerbated by the scarcity of comprehensive experimental data. Here, we introduce a computational framework to address part of this gap. First, we present a generative method for creating large-scale, realistic synthetic functional landscapes that capture non-linear interactions where biological activity depends on domain connectivity. Second, we propose a graph neural network architecture that explicitly encodes these topological constraints, distinguishing between format configurations that appear identical to sequence-only models. We demonstrate that this model, trained on synthetic landscapes, recapitulates complex functional properties and, via transfer learning, has the potential to achieve high predictive accuracy on limited biological datasets. We showcase the model's utility by optimizing trade-offs between efficacy and toxicity in trispecific T-cell engagers and retrieving optimal common light chains.

In this work, we prove exact learnability results for graph algorithms under bounded-degree and finite-precision constraints. Our approach follows a two-step process. First, we train an ensemble of multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) to execute the local instructions of a single node. Second, during inference, we use the trained MLP ensemble as the update function within a graph neural network (GNN). Leveraging Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) theory, we show that local instructions can be learned from a small training set, enabling the complete graph algorithm to be executed during inference without error and with high probability. To illustrate the learning power of our setting, we establish a rigorous learnability result for the LOCAL model of distributed computation. We further demonstrate positive learnability results for widely studied algorithms such as message flooding, breadth-first and depth-first search, and Bellman-Ford.</p></details> |  |

Here we want to tackle the question of how and to which extent can one regress scale-free processes, i.e. processes displaying power law behavior, like earthquakes or avalanches? We are interested in predicting the large ones, i.e. rare events in the training set which therefore require extrapolation capabilities of the model. For this we consider two paradigmatic problems that are statistically self-similar. The first one is a 2-dimensional fractional Gaussian field obeying linear dynamics, self-similar by construction and amenable to exact analysis. The second one is the Abelian sandpile model, exhibiting self-organized criticality. The emerging paradigm of Geometric Deep Learning shows that including known symmetries into the model's architecture is key to success. Here one may hope to extrapolate only by leveraging scale invariance. This is however a peculiar symmetry, as it involves possibly non-trivial coarse-graining operations and anomalous scaling. We perform experiments on various existing architectures like U-net, Riesz network (scale invariant by construction), or our own proposals: a wavelet-decomposition based Graph Neural Network (with discrete scale symmetry), a Fourier embedding layer and a Fourier-Mellin Neural Operator. Based on these experiments and a complete characterization of the linear case, we identify the main issues relative to spectral biases and coarse-grained representations, and discuss how to alleviate them with the relevant inductive biases.</p></details> | 29p, 22 figures |

Most existing methods preserve either spectral or spatial characteristics. Recent research has shown that preserving topological features helps maintain the predictive performance of graph neural networks (GNNs) trained on the coarsened graph but suffers from exponential time complexity. To address these problems, we propose Scalable Topology-Preserving Graph Coarsening (STPGC) by introducing the concepts of graph strong collapse and graph edge collapse extended from algebraic topology. STPGC comprises three new algorithms, GStrongCollapse, GEdgeCollapse, and NeighborhoodConing based on these two concepts, which eliminate dominated nodes and edges while rigorously preserving topological features. We further prove that STPGC preserves the GNN receptive field and develop approximate algorithms to accelerate GNN training. Experiments on node classification with GNNs demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of STPGC.</p></details> |  |
| **[GNN Explanations that do not Explain and How to find Them](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20815v2)** | 2026-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Explanations provided by Self-explainable Graph Neural Networks (SE-GNNs) are fundamental for understanding the model's inner workings and for identifying potential misuse of sensitive attributes. Although recent works have highlighted that these explanations can be suboptimal and potentially misleading, a characterization of their failure cases is unavailable. In this work, we identify a critical failure of SE-GNN explanations: explanations can be unambiguously unrelated to how the SE-GNNs infer labels. We show that, on the one hand, many SE-GNNs can achieve optimal true risk while producing these degenerate explanations, and on the other, most faithfulness metrics can fail to identify these failure modes. Our empirical analysis reveals that degenerate explanations can be maliciously planted (allowing an attacker to hide the use of sensitive attributes) and can also emerge naturally, highlighting the need for reliable auditing. To address this, we introduce a novel faithfulness metric that reliably marks degenerate explanations as unfaithful, in both malicious and natural settings. Our code is available in the supplemental.</p></details> | Accepted at ICLR26 |

However, due to differences in training protocols, forecast horizons, and data choices, it remains unclear which (if any) of these methods and architectures are most suitable for weather forecasting and for future model development. Here, we step back and provide a detailed empirical analysis, under controlled conditions, comparing and contrasting the most prominent DLWP models, along with their backbones. We accomplish this by predicting synthetic two-dimensional incompressible Navier-Stokes and real-world global weather dynamics. On synthetic data, we observe favorable performance of FNO, while on the real-world WeatherBench dataset, our results demonstrate the suitability of ConvLSTM and SwinTransformer for short-to-mid-ranged forecasts. For long-ranged weather rollouts of up to 50 years, we observe superior stability and physical soundness in architectures that formulate a spherical data representation, i.e., GraphCast and Spherical FNO.

While CP algorithms have evolved beyond traditional classifiers and regressors to sophisticated deep learning models like deep neural networks (DNNs), graph neural networks (GNNs), and large language models (LLMs), existing CP libraries often lack the model support and scalability for large-scale deep learning (DL) scenarios. This paper introduces TorchCP, a PyTorch-native library designed to integrate state-of-the-art CP algorithms into DL techniques, including DNN-based classifiers/regressors, GNNs, and LLMs. Released under the LGPL-3.0 license, TorchCP comprises about 16k lines of code, validated with 100\% unit test coverage and detailed documentation. Notably, TorchCP enables CP-specific training algorithms, online prediction, and GPU-accelerated batch processing, achieving up to 90\% reduction in inference time on large datasets. With its low-coupling design, comprehensive suite of advanced methods, and full GPU scalability, TorchCP empowers researchers and practitioners to enhance uncertainty quantification across cutting-edge applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Full-Graph vs. Mini-Batch Training: Comprehensive Analysis from a Batch Size and Fan-Out Size Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22678v1)** | 2026-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Full-graph and mini-batch Graph Neural Network (GNN) training approaches have distinct system design demands, making it crucial to choose the appropriate approach to develop. A core challenge in comparing these two GNN training approaches lies in characterizing their model performance (i.e., convergence and generalization) and computational efficiency. While a batch size has been an effective lens in analyzing such behaviors in deep neural networks (DNNs), GNNs extend this lens by introducing a fan-out size, as full-graph training can be viewed as mini-batch training with the largest possible batch size and fan-out size. However, the impact of the batch and fan-out size for GNNs remains insufficiently explored. To this end, this paper systematically compares full-graph vs. mini-batch training of GNNs through empirical and theoretical analyses from the view points of the batch size and fan-out size. Our key contributions include: 1) We provide a novel generalization analysis using the Wasserstein distance to study the impact of the graph structure, especially the fan-out size. 2) We uncover the non-isotropic effects of the batch size and the fan-out size in GNN convergence and generalization, providing practical guidance for tuning these hyperparameters under resource constraints. Finally, full-graph training does not always yield better model performance or computational efficiency than well-tuned smaller mini-batch settings. The implementation can be found in the github link: https://github.com/LIUMENGFAN-gif/GNN_fullgraph_minibatch_training.</p></details> |  |
| **[NAG: A Unified Native Architecture for Encoder-free Text-Graph Modeling in Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22657v1)** | 2026-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prevailing methods for integrating graphs into Language Models (LMs) typically rely on a segregated architecture: external Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) encode structural topology, while LMs process textual semantics. We argue this approach is suboptimal for text-graphs: it creates a conceptually disjointed interaction paradigm. By segregating structural encoding from semantic processing, these systems must perform a complex implicit alignment between abstract graph tokens and concrete textual elements. Challenging the necessity of external encoders, we propose NAG (Native Architecture for Graphs), a unified framework that internalizes graph processing within the LM's native manifold. Instead of bridging disparate embedding spaces, NAG repurposes the self-attention mechanism to enforce topological dependencies and recalibrates positional IDs to ensure structural equivalence. This allows the model to harness its intrinsic linguistic capability to simultaneously comprehend node and edge content alongside structural topology. We introduce two efficient implementations: NAG-Zero for absolute preservation of the base model's linguistic capabilities, and NAG-LoRA for enhanced structural adaptation. Experiments across diverse graph tasks validate that NAG achieves robust graph comprehension without the overhead of external encoders, offering a simpler, more coherent paradigm for text-graph modeling.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Logical Expressiveness in Graph Neural Networks via Path-Neighbor Aggregation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07994v3)** | 2026-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) can effectively model structural information of graphs, making them widely used in knowledge graph (KG) reasoning. However, existing studies on the expressive power of GNNs mainly focuses on simple single-relation graphs, and there is still insufficient discussion on the power of GNN to express logical rules in KGs. How to enhance the logical expressive power of GNNs is still a key issue. Motivated by this, we propose Path-Neighbor enhanced GNN (PN-GNN), a method to enhance the logical expressive power of GNN by aggregating node-neighbor embeddings on the reasoning path. First, we analyze the logical expressive power of existing GNN-based methods and point out the shortcomings of the expressive power of these methods. Then, we theoretically investigate the logical expressive power of PN-GNN, showing that it not only has strictly stronger expressive power than C-GNN but also that its $(k+1)$-hop logical expressiveness is strictly superior to that of $k$-hop. Finally, we evaluate the logical expressive power of PN-GNN on six synthetic datasets and two real-world datasets. Both theoretical analysis and extensive experiments confirm that PN-GNN enhances the expressive power of logical rules without compromising generalization, as evidenced by its competitive performance in KG reasoning tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AAAI 2026</p></details> |

Graph influence functions have emerged as promising tools to efficiently estimate the effects of edge deletions without retraining. However, existing influence prediction methods rely on strict convexity assumptions, exclusively consider the influence of edge deletions while disregarding edge insertions, and fail to capture changes in message propagation caused by these modifications. In this work, we propose a proximal Bregman response function specifically tailored for GNNs, relaxing the convexity requirement and enabling accurate influence prediction for standard neural network architectures. Furthermore, our method explicitly accounts for message propagation effects and extends influence prediction to both edge deletions and insertions in a principled way. Experiments with real-world datasets demonstrate accurate influence predictions for different characteristics of GNNs. We further demonstrate that the influence function is versatile in applications such as graph rewiring and adversarial attacks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

In this paper, we propose Assembly Flow Graph (AFG) to comprehensively represent the assembly flow of a binary executable as graph data. Importantly, AFG can be used to extract granular explanations needed to increase transparency for malware detection using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). However, since AFGs may be large in practice, we also propose a Meta-Coarsening approach to improve computational tractability via graph reduction. To evaluate our proposed approach we consider several novel and existing metrics to quantify the granularity and quality of explanations. Lastly, we also consider several hyperparameters in our proposed Meta-Coarsening approach that can be used to control the final explanation size. We evaluate our proposed approach using the CIC-DGG-2025 dataset. Our results indicate that our proposed AFG and Meta-Coarsening approach can provide both increased explainability and inference performance at certain coarsening levels. However, most importantly, to the best of our knowledge, we are the first to consider granular explainability in malware detection using GNNs.</p></details> |  |

Explainability techniques (XAI) have made remarkable progress in the interpretability of ML models. However, the non-euclidean nature of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) makes it difficult to reuse already existing XAI methods. While other works have focused on instance-based explanation methods for GNNs, very few have investigated model-based methods and, to our knowledge, none have tried to probe the embedding of the GNNs for structural graph properties. In this paper we present a model agnostic explainability pipeline for Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) employing diagnostic classifiers. We propose to consider graph-theoretic properties as the features of choice for studying the emergence of representations in GNNs. This pipeline aims to probe and interpret the learned representations in GNNs across various architectures and datasets, refining our understanding and trust in these models.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 22 figures, conference</p></details> |

By combining generative inverse design with multimodal learning, our approach accelerates the exploration of chemical-structural space and facilitates the discovery of materials that satisfy predefined property targets. MEIDNet exhibits strong latent-space alignment with cosine similarity 0.96 by fusion of three modalities through cross-modal learning. Through implementation of curriculum learning strategies, MEIDNet achieves ~60 times higher learning efficiency than conventional training techniques. The potential of our multimodal approach is demonstrated by generating low-bandgap perovskite structures at a stable, unique, and novel (SUN) rate of 13.6 %, which are further validated by ab initio methods. Our inverse design framework demonstrates both scalability and adaptability, paving the way for the universal learning of chemical space across diverse modalities.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bridging Graph Structure and Knowledge-Guided Editing for Interpretable Temporal Knowledge Graph Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21978v1)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal knowledge graph reasoning (TKGR) aims to predict future events by inferring missing entities with dynamic knowledge structures. Existing LLM-based reasoning methods prioritize contextual over structural relations, struggling to extract relevant subgraphs from dynamic graphs. This limits structural information understanding, leading to unstructured, hallucination-prone inferences especially with temporal inconsistencies. To address this problem, we propose IGETR (Integration of Graph and Editing-enhanced Temporal Reasoning), a hybrid reasoning framework that combines the structured temporal modeling capabilities of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with the contextual understanding of LLMs. IGETR operates through a three-stage pipeline. The first stage aims to ground the reasoning process in the actual data by identifying structurally and temporally coherent candidate paths through a temporal GNN, ensuring that inference starts from reliable graph-based evidence. The second stage introduces LLM-guided path editing to address logical and semantic inconsistencies, leveraging external knowledge to refine and enhance the initial paths. The final stage focuses on integrating the refined reasoning paths to produce predictions that are both accurate and interpretable. Experiments on standard TKG benchmarks show that IGETR achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming strong baselines with relative improvements of up to 5.6% on Hits@1 and 8.1% on Hits@3 on the challenging ICEWS datasets. Additionally, we execute ablation studies and additional analyses confirm the effectiveness of each component.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we formally introduce and study two query answering problems, namely, query answer classification and query answer retrieval. To solve these problems, we propose AnyCQ, a model that can classify answers to any conjunctive query on any knowledge graph. At the core of our framework lies a graph neural network trained using a reinforcement learning objective to answer Boolean queries. Trained only on simple, small instances, AnyCQ generalizes to large queries of arbitrary structure, reliably classifying and retrieving answers to queries that existing approaches fail to handle. This is empirically validated through our newly proposed, challenging benchmarks. Finally, we empirically show that AnyCQ can effectively transfer to completely novel knowledge graphs when equipped with an appropriate link prediction model, highlighting its potential for querying incomplete data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proce...</summary><p>Proceedings of the Fourth Learning on Graphs Conference (LoG 2025)</p></details> |

GNNs have close connections to logic. In particular, their expressive power is linked to that of modal logics and bounded-variable logics with counting. In many practical scenarios, graphs processed by GNNs have node features that act as unique identifiers. In this work, we study how such identifiers affect the expressive power of GNNs. We initiate a study of the key-invariant expressive power of GNNs, inspired by the notion of order-invariant definability in finite model theory: which node queries that depend only on the underlying graph structure can GNNs express on graphs with unique node identifiers? We provide answers for various classes of GNNs with local max- or sum-aggregation.</p></details> | 35 pages |
| **[Embodied Task Planning via Graph-Informed Action Generation with Large Lanaguage Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21841v1)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong zero-shot reasoning capabilities, their deployment as embodied agents still faces fundamental challenges in long-horizon planning. Unlike open-ended text generation, embodied agents must decompose high-level intent into actionable sub-goals while strictly adhering to the logic of a dynamic, observed environment. Standard LLM planners frequently fail to maintain strategy coherence over extended horizons due to context window limitation or hallucinate transitions that violate constraints. We propose GiG, a novel planning framework that structures embodied agents' memory using a Graph-in-Graph architecture. Our approach employs a Graph Neural Network (GNN) to encode environmental states into embeddings, organizing these embeddings into action-connected execution trace graphs within an experience memory bank. By clustering these graph embeddings, the framework enables retrieval of structure-aware priors, allowing agents to ground current decisions in relevant past structural patterns. Furthermore, we introduce a novel bounded lookahead module that leverages symbolic transition logic to enhance the agents' planning capabilities through the grounded action projection. We evaluate our framework on three embodied planning benchmarks-Robotouille Synchronous, Robotouille Asynchronous, and ALFWorld. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving Pass@1 performance gains of up to 22% on Robotouille Synchronous, 37% on Asynchronous, and 15% on ALFWorld with comparable or lower computational cost.</p></details> |  |

Despite its influence, this perspective leaves two gaps: (i) it is unclear whether WL tests are sufficiently primitive for understanding GNN expressivity, and (ii) WL-induced equivalence does not align well with characterizing the function classes that GNNs can approximate or compute. We attempt to address both gaps. First, we strengthen hardness results for the vanilla WL test, showing that in many settings it is not primitive enough to be implemented by constant-depth GNNs. Second, we propose an alternative framework for studying GNN expressivity based on an extended CONGEST model with an explicit preprocessing phase. Within this framework, we identify implicit shortcuts introduced in prior analyses and establish further results for WL tests in settings where graphs are augmented with virtual nodes and virtual edges.</p></details> |  |

While test-time training (TTT) offers a promising solution, existing Parameter Finetuning (PaFT) paradigm suffer from catastrophic forgetting, hindering their real-world applicability. We propose TTReFT, a novel Test-Time Representation FineTuning framework that transitions the adaptation target from model parameters to latent representations. Specifically, TTReFT achieves this through three key innovations: (1) uncertainty-guided node selection for specific interventions, (2) low-rank representation interventions that preserve pre-trained knowledge, and (3) an intervention-aware masked autoencoder that dynamically adjust masking strategy to accommodate the node selection scheme. Theoretically, we establish guarantees for TTReFT in OOD settings. Empirically, extensive experiments across five benchmark datasets demonstrate that TTReFT achieves consistent and superior performance. Our work establishes representation finetuning as a new paradigm for graph TTT, offering both theoretical grounding and immediate practical utility for real-world deployment.</p></details> |  |

However, GFL suffers from heterogeneity arising from diverse node features and structural topologies across multiple clients. To address both types of heterogeneity, we propose a novel graph Federated learning method via Semantic and Structural Alignment (FedSSA), which shares the knowledge of both node features and structural topologies. For node feature heterogeneity, we propose a novel variational model to infer class-wise node distributions, so that we can cluster clients based on inferred distributions and construct cluster-level representative distributions. We then minimize the divergence between local and cluster-level distributions to facilitate semantic knowledge sharing. For structural heterogeneity, we employ spectral Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and propose a spectral energy measure to characterize structural information, so that we can cluster clients based on spectral energy and build cluster-level spectral GNNs. We then align the spectral characteristics of local spectral GNNs with those of cluster-level spectral GNNs to enable structural knowledge sharing. Experiments on six homophilic and five heterophilic graph datasets under both non-overlapping and overlapping partitioning settings demonstrate that FedSSA consistently outperforms eleven state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | 33 pages |

In this work, we bridge the gap to real-world network structures by proposing a rigorous framework for MFC on large sparse graphs. We redefine the system state as a probability measure over decorated rooted neighborhoods, effectively capturing local heterogeneity. Our central contribution is a theoretical foundation for scalable reinforcement learning in this setting. We prove horizon-dependent locality: for finite-horizon problems, an agent's optimal policy at time t depends strictly on its (T-t)-hop neighborhood. This result renders the infinite-dimensional control problem tractable and underpins a novel Dynamic Programming Principle (DPP) on the lifted space of neighborhood distributions. Furthermore, we formally and experimentally justify the use of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for actor-critic algorithms in this context. Our framework naturally recovers classical MFC as a degenerate case while enabling efficient, theoretically grounded control on complex sparse topologies.</p></details> | 19 pages |
| **[Rethinking Federated Graph Foundation Models: A Graph-Language Alignment-based Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21369v1)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies of federated graph foundational models (FedGFMs) break the idealized and untenable assumption of having centralized data storage to train graph foundation models, and accommodate the reality of distributed, privacy-restricted data silos. Despite their simplicity and intuition, existing studies that project aligned generalizable knowledge onto a discrete token space via vector-quantized backbones suffer from irreversible knowledge loss during the quantization process. In this context, we argue that reconciling the semantic-structural orthogonality and integrity between pre-trained language models (PLMs) and graph neural networks (GNNs) is paramount for developing effective FedGFMs while simultaneously mitigating the severe data heterogeneity and communication constraints inherent in distributed, resource-limited environments. To address these issues, we propose FedGALA (Federated Graph And Language Alignment), a framework that resolves graph-based semantic-structural orthogonality and integrity in federated settings by employing unsupervised contrastive learning to align GNNs and frozen PLMs within a continuous embedding space, thereby capturing robust, transferable general knowledge. Subsequently, FedGALA leverages a communication-efficient prompt tuning mechanism to steer these pre-aligned encoders and frozen PLMs, facilitating effective adaptation to diverse downstream tasks while circumventing the prohibitive overhead of full-parameter fine-tuning. The comprehensive experiments validate that FedGALA outperforms all competitive baselines across multi-domain datasets on multiple tasks with up to 14.37% performance improvement.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under Review.

Trained with reinforcement learning (RL), the state-of-the-art graph attention model (GAM) achieves near-optimal solutions without requiring expert knowledge or labeled data. In this work, we generalize the existing graph attention mechanism and propose the extended graph attention model (EGAM). Our model utilizes multi-head dot-product attention to update both node and edge embeddings, addressing the limitations of the conventional GAM, which considers only node features. We employ an autoregressive encoder-decoder architecture and train it with policy gradient algorithms that incorporate a specially designed baseline. Experiments show that EGAM matches or outperforms existing methods across various routing problems. Notably, the proposed model demonstrates exceptional performance on highly constrained problems, highlighting its efficiency in handling complex graph structures.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fair Graph Machine Learning under Adversarial Missingness Processes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01591v5)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art results in many relevant tasks where decisions might disproportionately impact specific communities. However, existing work on fair GNNs often assumes that either sensitive attributes are fully observed or they are missing completely at random. We show that an adversarial missingness process can inadvertently disguise a fair model through the imputation, leading the model to overestimate the fairness of its predictions. We address this challenge by proposing Better Fair than Sorry (BFtS), a fair missing data imputation model for sensitive attributes. The key principle behind BFtS is that imputations should approximate the worst-case scenario for fairness -- i.e. when optimizing fairness is the hardest. We implement this idea using a 3-player adversarial scheme where two adversaries collaborate against a GNN classifier, and the classifier minimizes the maximum bias. Experiments using synthetic and real datasets show that BFtS often achieves a better fairness x accuracy trade-off than existing alternatives under an adversarial missingness process.</p></details> |  |

Such techniques usually involve solving large, sparse linear systems, where preconditioning methods are critical. In recent years, neural methods, particularly graph neural networks (GNNs), have demonstrated their potential through accelerated convergence. Nonetheless, to extract connective structures, existing techniques aggregate discretized system matrices into graphs, and suffer from rank inflation and a suboptimal convergence rate. In this paper, we articulate NeuraLSP, a novel neural preconditioner combined with a novel loss metric that leverages the left singular subspace of the system matrix's near-nullspace vectors. By compressing spectral information into a fixed low-rank operator, our method exhibits both theoretical guarantees and empirical robustness to rank inflation, affording up to a 53% speedup. Besides the theoretical guarantees for our newly-formulated loss function, our comprehensive experimental results across diverse families of PDEs also substantiate the aforementioned theoretical advances.</p></details> |  |

We build paired citation graphs, ground truth and GPT-4o-generated (from parametric knowledge), for 10,000 focal papers ($\approx$ 275k references) from SciSciNet, and added a field-matched random baseline that preserves out-degree and field distributions while breaking latent structure. We compare (i) structure-only node features (degree/closeness/eigenvector centrality, clustering, edge count) with (ii) 3072-D title/abstract embeddings, using an RF on graph-level aggregates and Graph Neural Networks with node features. Structure alone barely separates GPT from ground truth (RF accuracy $\approx$ 0.60) despite cleanly rejecting the random baseline ($\approx$ 0.89--0.92). By contrast, embeddings sharply increase separability: RF on aggregated embeddings reaches $\approx$ 0.83, and GNNs with embedding node features achieve 93\% test accuracy on GPT vs.\ ground truth. We show the robustness of our findings by replicating the pipeline with Claude Sonnet 4.5 and with multiple embedding models (OpenAI and SPECTER), with RF separability for ground truth vs.\ Claude $\approx 0.77$ and clean rejection of the random baseline. Thus, LLM bibliographies, generated purely from parametric knowledge, closely mimic human citation topology, but leave detectable semantic fingerprints; detection and debiasing should target content signals rather than global graph structure.</p></details> | <details><summary>34 pa...</summary><p>34 pages, 20 figures.

| **[TGSBM: Transformer-Guided Stochastic Block Model for Link Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20646v1)** | 2026-01-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Link prediction is a cornerstone of the Web ecosystem, powering applications from recommendation and search to knowledge graph completion and collaboration forecasting. However, large-scale networks present unique challenges: they contain hundreds of thousands of nodes and edges with heterogeneous and overlapping community structures that evolve over time. Existing approaches face notable limitations: traditional graph neural networks struggle to capture global structural dependencies, while recent graph transformers achieve strong performance but incur quadratic complexity and lack interpretable latent structure. We propose \textbf{TGSBM} (Transformer-Guided Stochastic Block Model), a framework that integrates the principled generative structure of Overlapping Stochastic Block Models with the representational power of sparse Graph Transformers. TGSBM comprises three main components: (i) \emph{expander-augmented sparse attention} that enables near-linear complexity and efficient global mixing, (ii) a \emph{neural variational encoder} that infers structured posteriors over community memberships and strengths, and (iii) a \emph{neural edge decoder} that reconstructs links via OSBM's generative process, preserving interpretability. Experiments across diverse benchmarks demonstrate competitive performance (mean rank 1.6 under HeaRT protocol), superior scalability (up to $6\times$ faster training), and interpretable community structures. These results position TGSBM as a practical approach that strikes a balance between accuracy, efficiency, and transparency for large-scale link prediction.</p></details> | 12 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Taxonomy of reduction matrices for Graph Coarsening](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11743v2)** | 2026-01-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph coarsening aims to diminish the size of a graph to lighten its memory footprint, and has numerous applications in graph signal processing and machine learning. It is usually defined using a reduction matrix and a lifting matrix, which, respectively, allows to project a graph signal from the original graph to the coarsened one and back. This results in a loss of information measured by the so-called Restricted Spectral Approximation (RSA). Most coarsening frameworks impose a fixed relationship between the reduction and lifting matrices, generally as pseudo-inverses of each other, and seek to define a coarsening that minimizes the RSA. In this paper, we remark that the roles of these two matrices are not entirely symmetric: indeed, putting constraints on the lifting matrix alone ensures the existence of important objects such as the coarsened graph's adjacency matrix or Laplacian. In light of this, in this paper, we introduce a more general notion of reduction matrix, that is not necessarily the pseudo-inverse of the lifting matrix. We establish a taxonomy of ``admissible'' families of reduction matrices, discuss the different properties that they must satisfy and whether they admit a closed-form description or not. We show that, for a fixed coarsening represented by a fixed lifting matrix, the RSA can be further reduced simply by modifying the reduction matrix. We explore different examples, including some based on a constrained optimization process of the RSA. Since this criterion has also been linked to the performance of Graph Neural Networks, we also illustrate the impact of this choices on different node classification tasks on coarsened graphs.</p></details> |  |
| **[CCMamba: Selective State-Space Models for Higher-Order Graph Learning on Combinatorial Complexes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20518v1)** | 2026-01-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Topological deep learning has emerged for modeling higher-order relational structures beyond pairwise interactions that standard graph neural networks fail to capture. Although combinatorial complexes offer a unified topological framework, most existing topological deep learning methods rely on local message passing via attention mechanisms, which incur quadratic complexity and remain low-dimensional, limiting scalability and rank-aware information aggregation in higher-order complexes.We propose Combinatorial Complex Mamba (CCMamba), the first unified mamba-based neural framework for learning on combinatorial complexes. CCMamba reformulates message passing as a selective state-space modeling problem by organizing multi-rank incidence relations into structured sequences processed by rank-aware state-space models. This enables adaptive, directional, and long range information propagation in linear time without self attention. We further establish the theoretical analysis that the expressive power upper-bound of CCMamba message passing is the 1-Weisfeiler-Lehman test. Experiments on graph, hypergraph, and simplicial benchmarks demonstrate that CCMamba consistently outperforms existing methods while exhibiting improved scalability and robustness to depth.</p></details> |  |
| **[GCL-OT: Graph Contrastive Learning with Optimal Transport for Heterophilic Text-Attributed Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16778v2)** | 2026-01-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, structure-text contrastive learning has shown promising performance on text-attributed graphs by leveraging the complementary strengths of graph neural networks and language models. However, existing methods typically rely on homophily assumptions in similarity estimation and hard optimization objectives, which limit their applicability to heterophilic graphs. Although existing methods can mitigate heterophily through structural adjustments or neighbor aggregation, they usually treat textual embeddings as static targets, leading to suboptimal alignment. In this work, we identify multi-granular heterophily in text-attributed graphs, including complete heterophily, partial heterophily, and latent homophily, which makes structure-text alignment particularly challenging due to mixed, noisy, and missing semantic correlations. To achieve flexible and bidirectional alignment, we propose GCL-OT, a novel graph contrastive learning framework with optimal transport, equipped with tailored mechanisms for each type of heterophily. Specifically, for partial heterophily, we design a RealSoftMax-based similarity estimator to emphasize key neighbor-word interactions while easing background noise. For complete heterophily, we introduce a prompt-based filter that adaptively excludes irrelevant noise during optimal transport alignment. Furthermore, we incorporate OT-guided soft supervision to uncover potential neighbors with similar semantics, enhancing the learning of latent homophily. Theoretical analysis shows that GCL-OT can improve the mutual information bound and Bayes error guarantees. Extensive experiments on nine benchmarks show that GCL-OT outperforms state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating its effectiveness and robustness.</p></details> | AAAI 2026 |
| **[PULSE: Socially-Aware User Representation Modeling Toward Parameter-Efficient Graph Collaborative Filtering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14720v2)** | 2026-01-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph-based social recommendation (SocialRec) has emerged as a powerful extension of graph collaborative filtering (GCF), which leverages graph neural networks (GNNs) to capture multi-hop collaborative signals from user-item interactions. These methods enrich user representations by incorporating social network information into GCF, thereby integrating additional collaborative signals from social relations. However, existing GCF and graph-based SocialRec approaches face significant challenges: they incur high computational costs and suffer from limited scalability due to the large number of parameters required to assign explicit embeddings to all users and items. In this work, we propose PULSE (Parameter-efficient User representation Learning with Social Knowledge), a framework that addresses this limitation by constructing user representations from socially meaningful signals without creating an explicit learnable embedding for each user. PULSE reduces the parameter size by up to 50% compared to the most lightweight GCF baseline. Beyond parameter efficiency, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming 13 GCF and graph-based social recommendation baselines across varying levels of interaction sparsity, from cold-start to highly active users, through a time- and memory-efficient modeling process.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages.

| **[Proactive SFC Provisioning with Forecast-Driven DRL in Data Centers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20229v1)** | 2026-01-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Service Function Chaining (SFC) requires efficient placement of Virtual Network Functions (VNFs) to satisfy diverse service requirements while maintaining high resource utilization in Data Centers (DCs). Conventional static resource allocation often leads to overprovisioning or underprovisioning due to the dynamic nature of traffic loads and application demands. To address this challenge, we propose a hybrid forecast-driven Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework that combines predictive intelligence with SFC provisioning. Specifically, we leverage DRL to generate datasets capturing DC resource utilization and service demands, which are then used to train deep learning forecasting models. Using Optuna-based hyperparameter optimization, the best-performing models, Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Network, Temporal Graph Neural Network, and Long Short-Term Memory, are combined into an ensemble to enhance stability and accuracy. The ensemble predictions are integrated into the DC selection process, enabling proactive placement decisions that consider both current and future resource availability. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method not only sustains high acceptance ratios for resource-intensive services such as Cloud Gaming and VoIP but also significantly improves acceptance ratios for latency-critical categories such as Augmented Reality increases from 30% to 50%, while Industry 4.0 improves from 30% to 45%. Consequently, the prediction-based model achieves significantly lower E2E latencies of 20.5%, 23.8%, and 34.8% reductions for VoIP, Video Streaming, and Cloud Gaming, respectively. This strategy ensures more balanced resource allocation, and reduces contention.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 3 figures, Accepted to IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC) 2026</p></details> |
| **[The Effect of Architecture During Continual Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19766v1)** | 2026-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Continual learning is a challenge for models with static architecture, as they fail to adapt to when data distributions evolve across tasks. We introduce a mathematical framework that jointly models architecture and weights in a Sobolev space, enabling a rigorous investigation into the role of neural network architecture in continual learning and its effect on the forgetting loss. We derive necessary conditions for the continual learning solution and prove that learning only model weights is insufficient to mitigate catastrophic forgetting under distribution shifts. Consequently, we prove that by learning the architecture and weights simultaneously at each task, we can reduce catastrophic forgetting. To learn weights and architecture simultaneously, we formulate continual learning as a bilevel optimization problem: the upper level selects an optimal architecture for a given task, while the lower level computes optimal weights via dynamic programming over all tasks. To solve the upper level problem, we introduce a derivative-free direct search algorithm to determine the optimal architecture. Once found, we must transfer knowledge from the current architecture to the optimal one. However, the optimal architecture will result in a weights parameter space different from the current architecture (i.e., dimensions of weights matrices will not match). To bridge the dimensionality gap, we develop a low-rank transfer mechanism to map knowledge across architectures of mismatched dimensions. Empirical studies across regression and classification problems, including feedforward, convolutional, and graph neural networks, demonstrate that learning the optimal architecture and weights simultaneously yields substantially improved performance (up to two orders of magnitude), reduced forgetting, and enhanced robustness to noise compared with static architecture approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[Leveraging Convolutional and Graph Networks for an Unsupervised Remote Sensing Labelling Tool](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00506v2)** | 2026-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine learning for remote sensing imaging relies on up-to-date and accurate labels for model training and testing. Labelling remote sensing imagery is time and cost intensive, requiring expert analysis. Previous labelling tools rely on pre-labelled data for training in order to label new unseen data. In this work, we define an unsupervised pipeline for finding and labelling geographical areas of similar context and content within Sentinel-2 satellite imagery. Our approach removes limitations of previous methods by utilising segmentation with convolutional and graph neural networks to encode a more robust feature space for image comparison. Unlike previous approaches we segment the image into homogeneous regions of pixels that are grouped based on colour and spatial similarity. Graph neural networks are used to aggregate information about the surrounding segments enabling the feature representation to encode the local neighbourhood whilst preserving its own local information. This reduces outliers in the labelling tool, allows users to label at a granular level, and allows a rotationally invariant semantic relationship at the image level to be formed within the encoding space. Our pipeline achieves high contextual consistency, with similarity scores of SSIM = 0.96 and SAM = 0.21 under context-aware evaluation, demonstrating robust organisation of the feature space for interactive labelling.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for Taylor and Francis, Annals of GIS * Video supplement demonstrating feature-space exploration and interactive labelling is available at: https://youtu.be/GZl1ebZJgEA and is archived at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.16676591</p></details> |
| **[Incident-Guided Spatiotemporal Traffic Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02528v1)** | 2026-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent years have witnessed the rapid development of deep-learning-based, graph-neural-network-based forecasting methods for modern intelligent transportation systems. However, most existing work focuses exclusively on capturing spatio-temporal dependencies from historical traffic data, while overlooking the fact that suddenly occurring transportation incidents, such as traffic accidents and adverse weather, serve as external disturbances that can substantially alter temporal patterns. We argue that this issue has become a major obstacle to modeling the dynamics of traffic systems and improving prediction accuracy, but the unpredictability of incidents makes it difficult to observe patterns from historical sequences. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel framework named the Incident-Guided Spatiotemporal Graph Neural Network (IGSTGNN). IGSTGNN explicitly models the incident's impact through two core components: an Incident-Context Spatial Fusion (ICSF) module to capture the initial heterogeneous spatial influence, and a Temporal Incident Impact Decay (TIID) module to model the subsequent dynamic dissipation. To facilitate research on the spatio-temporal impact of incidents on traffic flow, a large-scale dataset is constructed and released, featuring incident records that are time-aligned with traffic time series. On this new benchmark, the proposed IGSTGNN framework is demonstrated to achieve state-of-the-art performance. Furthermore, the generalizability of the ICSF and TIID modules is validated by integrating them into various existing models.</p></details> |  |

There is a growing need for scalable algorithms capable of handling the increasing variability, constraints, and uncertainties in modern power networks while providing accurate and fast solutions. To address this, machine learning techniques, particularly Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as promising approaches. This letter introduces PowerGraph-LLM, the first framework explicitly designed for solving OPF problems using Large Language Models (LLMs). The proposed approach combines graph and tabular representations of power grids to effectively query LLMs, capturing the complex relationships and constraints in power systems. A new implementation of in-context learning and fine-tuning protocols for LLMs is introduced, tailored specifically for the OPF problem. PowerGraph-LLM demonstrates reliable performances using off-the-shelf LLM. Our study reveals the impact of LLM architecture, size, and fine-tuning and demonstrates our framework's ability to handle realistic grid components and constraints.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at IEEE Transactions on Power Systems</p></details> |
| **[Fixed Aggregation Features Can Rival GNNs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19449v1)** | 2026-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) are widely believed to excel at node representation learning through trainable neighborhood aggregations. We challenge this view by introducing Fixed Aggregation Features (FAFs), a training-free approach that transforms graph learning tasks into tabular problems. This simple shift enables the use of well-established tabular methods, offering strong interpretability and the flexibility to deploy diverse classifiers. Across 14 benchmarks, well-tuned multilayer perceptrons trained on FAFs rival or outperform state-of-the-art GNNs and graph transformers on 12 tasks -- often using only mean aggregation. The only exceptions are the Roman Empire and Minesweeper datasets, which typically require unusually deep GNNs. To explain the theoretical possibility of non-trainable aggregations, we connect our findings to Kolmogorov-Arnold representations and discuss when mean aggregation can be sufficient. In conclusion, our results call for (i) richer benchmarks benefiting from learning diverse neighborhood aggregations, (ii) strong tabular baselines as standard, and (iii) employing and advancing tabular models for graph data to gain new insights into related tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[GraphSB: Boosting Imbalanced Node Classification on Graphs through Structural Balance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19352v1)** | 2026-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Imbalanced node classification is a critical challenge in graph learning, where most existing methods typically utilize Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to learn node representations. These methods can be broadly categorized into the data-level and the algorithm-level. The former aims to synthesize minority-class nodes to mitigate quantity imbalance, while the latter tries to optimize the learning process to highlight minority classes. However, neither of them addresses the inherently imbalanced graph structure, which is a fundamental factor that incurs majority-class dominance and minority-class assimilation in GNNs. Our theoretical analysis further supports this critical insight. Therefore, we propose GraphSB (Graph Structural Balance), a novel framework that incorporates Structural Balance as a key strategy to address the underlying imbalanced graph structure before node synthesis. Structural Balance performs a two-stage structure optimization: Structure Enhancement that mines hard samples near decision boundaries through dual-view analysis and enhances connectivity for minority classes through adaptive augmentation, and Relation Diffusion that propagates the enhanced minority context while simultaneously capturing higher-order structural dependencies. Thus, GraphSB balances structural distribution before node synthesis, enabling more effective learning in GNNs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GraphSB significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. More importantly, the proposed Structural Balance can be seamlessly integrated into state-of-the-art methods as a simple plug-and-play module, increasing their accuracy by an average of 4.57%.</p></details> |  |

| **[Traffic Engineering in Large-scale Networks with Generalizable Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24203v2)** | 2026-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic Engineering (TE) in large-scale networks like cloud Wide Area Networks (WANs) and Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite constellations is a critical challenge. Although learning-based approaches have been proposed to address the scalability of traditional TE algorithms, their practical application is often hindered by a lack of generalization, high training overhead, and a failure to respect link capacities. This paper proposes TELGEN, a novel TE algorithm that learns to solve TE problems efficiently in large-scale network scenarios, while achieving superior generalizability across diverse network conditions. TELGEN is based on the novel idea of transforming the problem of "predicting the optimal TE solution" into "predicting the optimal TE algorithm", which enables TELGEN to learn and efficiently approximate the end-to-end solving process of classical optimal TE algorithms. The learned algorithm is agnostic to the exact underlying network topology or traffic patterns, and is able to very efficiently solve TE problems given arbitrary inputs and generalize well to unseen topologies and demands. We train and evaluate TELGEN with random and real-world topologies, with networks of up to 5000 nodes and 3.6x10^6 links in testing. TELGEN shows less than 3% optimality gap while ensuring feasibility in all testing scenarios, even when the test network has 2-20x more nodes than the largest training network. It also saves up to 84% TE solving time than traditional interior-point method, and reduces up to 79.6% training time per epoch than the state-of-the-art learning-based algorithm.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at IEEE Transactions on Networking</p></details> |

We introduce cross-graph inter-message passing (XIMP), which performs message passing both within and across multiple related graph representations. For small molecules, we combine the molecular graph with scaffold-aware junction trees and pharmacophore-encoding extended reduced graphs, integrating complementary abstractions. While prior work is either limited to a single abstraction or non-iterative communication across graphs, XIMP supports an arbitrary number of abstractions and both direct and indirect communication between them in each layer. Across ten diverse molecular property prediction tasks, XIMP outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in most cases, leveraging interpretable abstractions as an inductive bias that guides learning toward established chemical concepts, enhancing generalization in low-data settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Causal Graph Neural Networks for Healthcare](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02531v4)** | 2026-01-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Healthcare artificial intelligence systems routinely fail when deployed across institutions, with documented performance drops and perpetuation of discriminatory patterns embedded in historical data. This brittleness stems, in part, from learning statistical associations rather than causal mechanisms. Causal graph neural networks address this triple crisis of distribution shift, discrimination, and inscrutability by combining graph-based representations of biomedical data with causal inference principles to learn invariant mechanisms rather than spurious correlations. This Review examines methodological foundations spanning structural causal models, disentangled causal representation learning, and techniques for interventional prediction and counterfactual reasoning on graphs. We analyse applications demonstrating clinical value across psychiatric diagnosis through brain network analysis, cancer subtyping via multi-omics causal integration, continuous physiological monitoring with mechanistic interpretation, and drug recommendation correcting prescription bias. These advances establish foundations for patient-specific Causal Digital Twins, enabling in silico clinical experimentation, with integration of large language models for hypothesis generation and causal graph neural networks for mechanistic validation. Substantial barriers remain, including computational requirements precluding real-time deployment, validation challenges demanding multi-modal evidence triangulation beyond cross-validation, and risks of causal-washing where methods employ causal terminology without rigorous evidentiary support. We propose tiered frameworks distinguishing causally-inspired architectures from causally-validated discoveries and identify critical research priorities making causal rather than purely associational claims.</p></details> |  |
