| **[Multifractal behavior of price changes in the Green Bonds funds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08886v1)** | 2025-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Climate change has driven the market to seek new ways of raising funds to mitigate its effects. One such innovation is the emergence of Green Bonds financial assets specifically designed to support sustainable projects. This study explores the fractal behavior of daily price changes in thirty-five Green Bond funds using the Multifractal Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (MFDFA) method. Our results indicate that price changes exhibit persistent behavior and high multifractality, characterized by large fluctuations. Only one of the thirty-five time series analyzed showed an outlier result, suggesting that the funds display very similar behavior. By shuffling the series, we were able to reduce multifractality significantly. These findings suggest that Green Bond funds exhibit multifractal behavior typical of other financial assets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can TabPFN Compete with GNNs for Node Classification via Graph Tabularization?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08798v1)** | 2025-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models pretrained on large data have demonstrated remarkable zero-shot generalization capabilities across domains. Building on the success of TabPFN for tabular data and its recent extension to time series, we investigate whether graph node classification can be effectively reformulated as a tabular learning problem. We introduce TabPFN-GN, which transforms graph data into tabular features by extracting node attributes, structural properties, positional encodings, and optionally smoothed neighborhood features. This enables TabPFN to perform direct node classification without any graph-specific training or language model dependencies. Our experiments on 12 benchmark datasets reveal that TabPFN-GN achieves competitive performance with GNNs on homophilous graphs and consistently outperforms them on heterophilous graphs. These results demonstrate that principled feature engineering can bridge the gap between tabular and graph domains, providing a practical alternative to task-specific GNN training and LLM-dependent graph foundation models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Rejec...</summary><p>Rejected from LoG 2025 (submitted August 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Neural Ordinary Differential Equations for Simulating Metabolic Pathway Dynamics from Time-Series Multiomics Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08732v1)** | 2025-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The advancement of human healthspan and bioengineering relies heavily on predicting the behavior of complex biological systems. While high-throughput multiomics data is becoming increasingly abundant, converting this data into actionable predictive models remains a bottleneck. High-capacity, datadriven simulation systems are critical in this landscape; unlike classical mechanistic models restricted by prior knowledge, these architectures can infer latent interactions directly from observational data, allowing for the simulation of temporal trajectories and the anticipation of downstream intervention effects in personalized medicine and synthetic biology. To address this challenge, we introduce Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (NODEs) as a dynamic framework for learning the complex interplay between the proteome and metabolome. We applied this framework to time-series data derived from engineered Escherichia coli strains, modeling the continuous dynamics of metabolic pathways. The proposed NODE architecture demonstrates superior performance in capturing system dynamics compared to traditional machine learning pipelines. Our results show a greater than 90% improvement in root mean squared error over baselines across both Limonene (up to 94.38% improvement) and Isopentenol (up to 97.65% improvement) pathway datasets. Furthermore, the NODE models demonstrated a 1000x acceleration in inference time, establishing them as a scalable, high-fidelity tool for the next generation of metabolic engineering and biological discovery.</p></details> |  |
| **[PRISM: Lightweight Multivariate Time-Series Classification through Symmetric Multi-Resolution Convolutional Layers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04503v2)** | 2025-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multivariate time series classification supports applications from wearable sensing to biomedical monitoring and demands models that can capture both short-term patterns and longer-range temporal dependencies. Despite recent advances, Transformer and CNN models often remain computationally heavy and rely on many parameters. This work presents PRISM(Per-channel Resolution Informed Symmetric Module), a lightweight fully convolutional classifier. Operating in a channel-independent manner, in its early stage it applies a set of multi-resolution symmetric convolutional filters. This symmetry enforces structural constraints inspired by linear-phase FIR filters from classical signal processing, effectively halving the number of learnable parameters within the initial layers while preserving the full receptive field. Across the diverse UEA multivariate time-series archive as well as specific benchmarks in human activity recognition, sleep staging, and biomedical signals, PRISM matches or outperforms state-of-the-art CNN and Transformer models while using significantly fewer parameters and markedly lower computational cost. By bringing a principled signal processing prior into a modern neural architecture, PRISM offers an effective and computationally economical solution for multivariate time series classification.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Hybrid Model for Stock Market Forecasting: Integrating News Sentiment and Time Series Data with Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08567v1)** | 2025-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Stock market prediction is a long-standing challenge in finance, as accurate forecasts support informed investment decisions. Traditional models rely mainly on historical prices, but recent work shows that financial news can provide useful external signals. This paper investigates a multimodal approach that integrates companies' news articles with their historical stock data to improve prediction performance. We compare a Graph Neural Network (GNN) model with a baseline LSTM model. Historical data for each company is encoded using an LSTM, while news titles are embedded with a language model. These embeddings form nodes in a heterogeneous graph, and GraphSAGE is used to capture interactions between articles, companies, and industries. We evaluate two targets: a binary direction-of-change label and a significance-based label. Experiments on the US equities and Bloomberg datasets show that the GNN outperforms the LSTM baseline, achieving 53% accuracy on the first target and a 4% precision gain on the second. Results also indicate that companies with more associated news yield higher prediction accuracy. Moreover, headlines contain stronger predictive signals than full articles, suggesting that concise news summaries play an important role in short-term market reactions.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 6 figures.

| **[Sonnet: Spectral Operator Neural Network for Multivariable Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15312v2)** | 2025-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multivariable time series forecasting methods can integrate information from exogenous variables, leading to significant prediction accuracy gains. The transformer architecture has been widely applied in various time series forecasting models due to its ability to capture long-range sequential dependencies. However, a naïve application of transformers often struggles to effectively model complex relationships among variables over time. To mitigate against this, we propose a novel architecture, termed Spectral Operator Neural Network (Sonnet). Sonnet applies learnable wavelet transformations to the input and incorporates spectral analysis using the Koopman operator. Its predictive skill relies on the Multivariable Coherence Attention (MVCA), an operation that leverages spectral coherence to model variable dependencies. Our empirical analysis shows that Sonnet yields the best performance on $34$ out of $47$ forecasting tasks with an average mean absolute error (MAE) reduction of $2.2\%$ against the most competitive baseline. We further show that MVCA can remedy the deficiencies of naïve attention in various deep learning models, reducing MAE by $10.7\%$ on average in the most challenging forecasting tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper accepted for oral presentation at AAAI 2026.

| **[Can Slow-thinking LLMs Reason Over Time? Empirical Studies in Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24511v3)** | 2025-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting (TSF) is a fundamental and widely studied task, spanning methods from classical statistical approaches to modern deep learning and multimodal language modeling. Despite their effectiveness, these methods often follow a fast thinking paradigm emphasizing pattern extraction and direct value mapping, while overlooking explicit reasoning over temporal dynamics and contextual dependencies. Meanwhile, emerging slow-thinking LLMs (e.g., ChatGPT-o1, DeepSeek-R1) have demonstrated impressive multi-step reasoning capabilities across diverse domains, suggesting a new opportunity for reframing TSF as a structured reasoning task. This motivates a key question: can slow-thinking LLMs effectively reason over temporal patterns to support time series forecasting, even in zero-shot manner? To investigate this, in this paper, we propose TimeReasoner, an extensive empirical study that formulates TSF as a conditional reasoning task. We design a series of prompting strategies to elicit inference-time reasoning from pretrained slow-thinking LLMs and evaluate their performance across diverse TSF benchmarks. Our findings reveal that slow-thinking LLMs exhibit non-trivial zero-shot forecasting capabilities, especially in capturing high-level trends and contextual shifts. While preliminary, our study surfaces important insights into the reasoning behaviors of LLMs in temporal domains highlighting both their potential and limitations. We hope this work catalyzes further research into reasoning-based forecasting paradigms and paves the way toward more interpretable and generalizable TSF frameworks.</p></details> |  |
| **[FRWKV:Frequency-Domain Linear Attention for Long-Term Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07539v2)** | 2025-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional Transformers face a major bottleneck in long-sequence time series forecasting due to their quadratic complexity $(\mathcal{O}(T^2))$ and their limited ability to effectively exploit frequency-domain information. Inspired by RWKV's $\mathcal{O}(T)$ linear attention and frequency-domain modeling, we propose FRWKV, a frequency-domain linear-attention framework that overcomes these limitations. Our model integrates linear attention mechanisms with frequency-domain analysis, achieving $\mathcal{O}(T)$ computational complexity in the attention path while exploiting spectral information to enhance temporal feature representations for scalable long-sequence modeling. Across eight real-world datasets, FRWKV achieves a first-place average rank. Our ablation studies confirm the critical roles of both the linear attention and frequency-encoder components. This work demonstrates the powerful synergy between linear attention and frequency analysis, establishing a new paradigm for scalable time series modeling. Code is available at this repository: https://github.com/yangqingyuan-byte/FRWKV.</p></details> |  |
| **[SPROCKET: Extending ROCKET to Distance-Based Time-Series Transformations With Prototypes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08246v1)** | 2025-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Classical Time Series Classification algorithms are dominated by feature engineering strategies. One of the most prominent of these transforms is ROCKET, which achieves strong performance through random kernel features. We introduce SPROCKET (Selected Prototype Random Convolutional Kernel Transform), which implements a new feature engineering strategy based on prototypes. On a majority of the UCR and UEA Time Series Classification archives, SPROCKET achieves performance comparable to existing convolutional algorithms and the new MR-HY-SP ( MultiROCKET-HYDRA-SPROCKET) ensemble's average accuracy ranking exceeds HYDRA-MR, the previous best convolutional ensemble's performance. These experimental results demonstrate that prototype-based feature transformation can enhance both accuracy and robustness in time series classification.</p></details> | <details><summary>63 Pa...</summary><p>63 Pages, 28 in main body with 3 appendices for supplemental figures</p></details> |
| **[Wishart kernel density estimation for strongly mixing time series on the cone of positive definite matrices](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08232v1)** | 2025-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A Wishart kernel density estimator (KDE) is introduced for density estimation in the cone of positive definite matrices. The estimator is boundary-aware and mitigates the boundary bias suffered by conventional KDEs, while remaining simple to implement. Its mean squared error, uniform strong consistency on expanding compact sets, and asymptotic normality are established under the Lebesgue measure and suitable mixing conditions. This work represents the first study of density estimation on this space under any metric. For independent observations, an asymptotic upper bound on the mean absolute error is also derived. A simulation study compares the performance of the Wishart KDE to another boundary-aware KDE that relies on the matrix-variate lognormal distribution proposed by Schwartzman [Int. Stat. Rev., 2016, 84(3), 456-486]. Results suggest that the Wishart KDE is superior for a selection of autoregressive coefficient matrices and innovation covariance matrices when estimating the stationary marginal density of a Wishart autoregressive process. To illustrate the practical utility of the Wishart KDE, an application to finance is made by estimating the marginal density function of a time series of realized covariance matrices, calculated from 5-minute intra-day returns, between the share prices of Amazon Corp. and the Standard & Poor's 500 exchange-traded fund over a one-year period. All code is publicly available via the R package ksm to facilitate implementation of the method and reproducibility of the findings.</p></details> | <details><summary>40 pa...</summary><p>40 pages, 4 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |
| **[OIPR: Evaluation for Time-series Anomaly Detection Inspired by Operator Interest](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01260v2)** | 2025-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the growing adoption of time-series anomaly detection (TAD) technology, numerous studies have employed deep learning-based detectors to analyze time-series data in the fields of Internet services, industrial systems, and sensors. The selection and optimization of anomaly detectors strongly rely on the availability of an effective evaluation for TAD performance. Since anomalies in time-series data often manifest as a sequence of points, conventional metrics that solely consider the detection of individual points are inadequate. Existing TAD evaluators typically employ point-based or event-based metrics to capture the temporal context. However, point-based evaluators tend to overestimate detectors that excel only in detecting long anomalies, while event-based evaluators are susceptible to being misled by fragmented detection results. To address these limitations, we propose OIPR (Operator Interest-based Precision and Recall metrics), a novel TAD evaluator with area-based metrics. It models the process of operators receiving detector alarms and handling anomalies, utilizing area under the operator interest curve to evaluate TAD performance. Furthermore, we build a special scenario dataset to compare the characteristics of different evaluators. Through experiments conducted on the special scenario dataset and five real-world datasets, we demonstrate the remarkable performance of OIPR in extreme and complex scenarios. It achieves a balance between point and event perspectives, overcoming their primary limitations and offering applicability to broader situations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Flow-based Conformal Prediction for Multi-dimensional Time Series](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05709v2)** | 2025-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series prediction underpins a broad range of downstream tasks across many scientific domains. Recent advances and increasing adoption of black-box machine learning models for time series prediction highlight the critical need for reliable uncertainty quantification. While conformal prediction has gained attention as a reliable uncertainty quantification method, conformal prediction for time series faces two key challenges: (1) adaptively leveraging correlations in features and non-conformity scores to overcome the exchangeability assumption, and (2) constructing prediction sets for multi-dimensional outcomes. To address these challenges jointly, we propose a novel conformal prediction method for time series using flow with classifier-free guidance. We provide coverage guarantees by establishing exact non-asymptotic marginal coverage and a finite-sample bound on conditional coverage for the proposed method. Evaluations on real-world time series datasets demonstrate that our method constructs significantly smaller prediction sets than existing conformal prediction methods while maintaining target coverage.</p></details> |  |

Advances in large language models (LLMs) offer a chance to act as scientific assistants, helping people grasp complex research areas. This study examines how LLMs evolve in healthcare disparities research, with attention to public access to relevant information. Methods. We studied three well-known LLMs: ChatGPT, Copilot, and Gemini. Each week, we asked them a consistent prompt about research themes in healthcare disparities and tracked how their answers changed over a one-month period. Analysis. The themes produced by the LLMs were categorized and cross-checked against H-index values from the Web of Science to verify relevance.

The outputs aligned with actual scientific impact and trends in the field, indicating that LLMs can help people understand the healthcare disparities landscape. Time-series comparisons showed differences among the models in how broadly and deeply they identified and classified themes. Conclusion. The study offers a framework that uses the evolution of multiple LLMs to illuminate AI tools for studying healthcare disparities, informing future research and public engagement strategies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Comme...</summary><p>Comments: 13 pages, 2 figures, 1 table.

| **[Bridging the Clinical Expertise Gap: Development of a Web-Based Platform for Accessible Time Series Forecasting and Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07992v1)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting has applications across domains and industries, especially in healthcare, but the technical expertise required to analyze data, build models, and interpret results can be a barrier to using these techniques. This article presents a web platform that makes the process of analyzing and plotting data, training forecasting models, and interpreting and viewing results accessible to researchers and clinicians. Users can upload data and generate plots to showcase their variables and the relationships between them. The platform supports multiple forecasting models and training techniques which are highly customizable according to the user's needs. Additionally, recommendations and explanations can be generated from a large language model that can help the user choose appropriate parameters for their data and understand the results for each model. The goal is to integrate this platform into learning health systems for continuous data collection and inference from clinical pipelines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Near-real time fires detection using satellite imagery in Sudan conflict](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07925v1)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The challenges of ongoing war in Sudan highlight the need for rapid monitoring and analysis of such conflicts. Advances in deep learning and readily available satellite remote sensing imagery allow for near real-time monitoring. This paper uses 4-band imagery from Planet Labs with a deep learning model to show that fire damage in armed conflicts can be monitored with minimal delay. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach using five case studies in Sudan. We show that, compared to a baseline, the automated method captures the active fires and charred areas more accurately. Our results indicate that using 8-band imagery or time series of such imagery only result in marginal gains.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bounds on inequality with incomplete data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07709v1)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We develop a unified, nonparametric framework for sharp partial identification and inference on inequality indices when income or wealth are only coarsely observed -- for example via grouped tables or individual interval reports -- possibly together with linear restrictions such as known means or subgroup totals. First, for a broad class of Schur-convex inequality measures, we characterize extremal allocations and show that sharp bounds are attained by distributions with simple, finite support, reducing the underlying infinite-dimensional problem to finite-dimensional optimization. Second, for indices that admit linear-fractional representations after suitable ordering of the data (including the Gini coefficient, quantile ratios, and the Hoover index), we recast the bound problems as linear or quadratic programs, yielding fast computation of numerically sharp bounds. Third, we establish $\sqrt{n}$ inference for bound endpoints using a uniform directional delta method and a bootstrap procedure for standard errors. In ELSA wealth data with mixed point and interval observations, we obtain sharp Gini bounds of 0.714--0.792 for liquid savings and 0.686--0.767 for a broad savings measure; historical U.S. income tables deliver time-series bounds for the Gini, quantile ratios, and Hoover index under grouped information.</p></details> |  |
| **[In-Context and Few-Shots Learning for Forecasting Time Series Data based on Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07705v1)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing data-driven approaches in modeling and predicting time series data include ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average), Transformer-based models, LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) and TCN (Temporal Convolutional Network). These approaches, and in particular deep learning-based models such as LSTM and TCN, have shown great results in predicting time series data. With the advancement of leveraging pre-trained foundation models such as Large Language Models (LLMs) and more notably Google's recent foundation model for time series data, {\it TimesFM} (Time Series Foundation Model), it is of interest to investigate whether these foundation models have the capability of outperforming existing modeling approaches in analyzing and predicting time series data. This paper investigates the performance of using LLM models for time series data prediction. We investigate the in-context learning methodology in the training of LLM models that are specific to the underlying application domain. More specifically, the paper explores training LLMs through in-context, zero-shot and few-shot learning and forecasting time series data with OpenAI {\tt o4-mini} and Gemini 2.5 Flash Lite, as well as the recent Google's Transformer-based TimesFM, a time series-specific foundation model, along with two deep learning models, namely TCN and LSTM networks. The findings indicate that TimesFM has the best overall performance with the lowest RMSE value (0.3023) and the competitive inference time (266 seconds). Furthermore, OpenAI's o4-mini also exhibits a good performance based on Zero Shot learning. These findings highlight pre-trained time series foundation models as a promising direction for real-time forecasting, enabling accurate and scalable deployment with minimal model adaptation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Instruction-based Time Series Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01504v3)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In time series editing, we aim to modify some properties of a given time series without altering others. For example, when analyzing a hospital patient's blood pressure, we may add a sudden early drop and observe how it impacts their future while preserving other conditions. Existing diffusion-based editors rely on rigid, predefined attribute vectors as conditions and produce all-or-nothing edits through sampling. This attribute- and sampling-based approach limits flexibility in condition format and lacks customizable control over editing strength. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Instruction-based Time Series Editing, where users specify intended edits using natural language. This allows users to express a wider range of edits in a more accessible format. We then introduce InstructTime, the first instruction-based time series editor. InstructTime takes in time series and instructions, embeds them into a shared multi-modal representation space, then decodes their embeddings to generate edited time series. By learning a structured multi-modal representation space, we can easily interpolate between embeddings to achieve varying degrees of edit. To handle local and global edits together, we propose multi-resolution encoders. In our experiments, we use synthetic and real datasets and find that InstructTime is a state-of-the-art time series editor: InstructTime achieves high-quality edits with controllable strength, can generalize to unseen instructions, and can be easily adapted to unseen conditions through few-shot learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Are Time-Series Foundation Models Deployment-Ready? A Systematic Study of Adversarial Robustness Across Domains](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19397v2)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time-Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) are rapidly transitioning from research prototypes to core components of critical decision-making systems, driven by their impressive zero-shot forecasting capabilities. However, as their deployment surges, a critical blind spot remains: their fragility under adversarial attacks. This lack of scrutiny poses severe risks, particularly as TSFMs enter high-stakes environments vulnerable to manipulation. We present a systematic, diagnostic study arguing that for TSFMs, robustness is not merely a secondary metric but a prerequisite for trustworthy deployment comparable to accuracy. Our evaluation framework, explicitly tailored to the unique constraints of time series, incorporates normalized, sparsity-aware perturbation budgets and unified scale-invariant metrics across white-box and black-box settings. Across six representative TSFMs, we demonstrate that current architectures are alarmingly brittle: even small perturbations can reliably steer forecasts toward specific failure modes, such as trend flips and malicious drifts. We uncover TSFM-specific vulnerability patterns, including horizon-proximal brittleness, increased susceptibility with longer context windows, and weak cross-model transfer that points to model-specific failure modes rather than generic distortions. Finally, we show that simple adversarial fine-tuning offers a cost-effective path to substantial robustness gains, even with out-of-domain data. This work bridges the gap between TSFM capabilities and safety constraints, offering essential guidance for hardening the next generation of forecasting systems.</p></details> | Preprint |
| **[Time Series Foundation Models for Process Model Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07624v1)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Process Model Forecasting (PMF) aims to predict how the control-flow structure of a process evolves over time by modeling the temporal dynamics of directly-follows (DF) relations, complementing predictive process monitoring that focuses on single-case prefixes. Prior benchmarks show that machine learning and deep learning models provide only modest gains over statistical baselines, mainly due to the sparsity and heterogeneity of the DF time series. We investigate Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs), large pre-trained models for generic time series, as an alternative for PMF. Using DF time series derived from real-life event logs, we compare zero-shot use of TSFMs, without additional training, with fine-tuned variants adapted on PMF-specific data. TSFMs generally achieve lower forecasting errors (MAE and RMSE) than traditional and specialized models trained from scratch on the same logs, indicating effective transfer of temporal structure from non-process domains. While fine-tuning can further improve accuracy, the gains are often small and may disappear on smaller or more complex datasets, so zero-shot use remains a strong default. Our study highlights the generalization capability and data efficiency of TSFMs for process-related time series and, to the best of our knowledge, provides the first systematic evaluation of temporal foundation models for PMF.</p></details> |  |
| **[Weighted Contrastive Learning for Anomaly-Aware Time-Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07569v1)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reliable forecasting of multivariate time series under anomalous conditions is crucial in applications such as ATM cash logistics, where sudden demand shifts can disrupt operations. Modern deep forecasters achieve high accuracy on normal data but often fail when distribution shifts occur. We propose Weighted Contrastive Adaptation (WECA), a Weighted contrastive objective that aligns normal and anomaly-augmented representations, preserving anomaly-relevant information while maintaining consistency under benign variations. Evaluations on a nationwide ATM transaction dataset with domain-informed anomaly injection show that WECA improves SMAPE on anomaly-affected data by 6.1 percentage points compared to a normally trained baseline, with negligible degradation on normal data. These results demonstrate that WECA enhances forecasting reliability under anomalies without sacrificing performance during regular operations.</p></details> |  |
| **[On Conditional Independence Graph Learning From Multi-Attribute Gaussian Dependent Time Series](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07557v1)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Estimation of the conditional independence graph (CIG) of high-dimensional multivariate Gaussian time series from multi-attribute data is considered. Existing methods for graph estimation for such data are based on single-attribute models where one associates a scalar time series with each node. In multi-attribute graphical models, each node represents a random vector or vector time series. In this paper we provide a unified theoretical analysis of multi-attribute graph learning for dependent time series using a penalized log-likelihood objective function formulated in the frequency domain using the discrete Fourier transform of the time-domain data. We consider both convex (sparse-group lasso) and non-convex (log-sum and SCAD group penalties) penalty/regularization functions. We establish sufficient conditions in a high-dimensional setting for consistency (convergence of the inverse power spectral density to true value in the Frobenius norm), local convexity when using non-convex penalties, and graph recovery. We do not impose any incoherence or irrepresentability condition for our convergence results. We also empirically investigate selection of the tuning parameters based on the Bayesian information criterion, and illustrate our approach using numerical examples utilizing both synthetic and real data.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 3 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

Many countries have constructed monitoring stations to hourly collect pollution values. Recently, there is a research in Daegu city, Korea for real-time air quality monitoring via sensors installed on taxis running across the whole city. The collected data is huge (1-second interval) and in both Spatial and Temporal format. In this paper, based on this spatiotemporal Big data, we propose a real-time air pollution prediction model based on Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) algorithm for image-like Spatial distribution of air pollution. Regarding to Temporal information in the data, we introduce a combination of a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) unit for time series data and a Neural Network model for other air pollution impact factors such as weather conditions to build a hybrid prediction model. This model is simple in architecture but still brings good prediction ability.</p></details> | <details><summary>- We ...</summary><p>- We fix typos and grammars through out the paper. - We fix layout of figure for better view. - We update mathematic formula and its description. - We add more insights to experimental results. - We correct author names in references</p></details> |
| **[HN-MVTS: HyperNetwork-based Multivariate Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08340v2)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate forecasting of multivariate time series data remains a formidable challenge, particularly due to the growing complexity of temporal dependencies in real-world scenarios. While neural network-based models have achieved notable success in this domain, complex channel-dependent models often suffer from performance degradation compared to channel-independent models that do not consider the relationship between components but provide high robustness due to small capacity. In this work, we propose HN-MVTS, a novel architecture that integrates a hypernetwork-based generative prior with an arbitrary neural network forecasting model. The input of this hypernetwork is a learnable embedding matrix of time series components. To restrict the number of new parameters, the hypernetwork learns to generate the weights of the last layer of the target forecasting networks, serving as a data-adaptive regularizer that improves generalization and long-range predictive accuracy. The hypernetwork is used only during the training, so it does not increase the inference time compared to the base forecasting model. Extensive experiments on eight benchmark datasets demonstrate that application of HN-MVTS to the state-of-the-art models (DLinear, PatchTST, TSMixer, etc.) typically improves their performance. Our findings suggest that hypernetwork-driven parameterization offers a promising direction for enhancing existing forecasting techniques in complex scenarios.</p></details> | AAAI 2026 |
| **[Non-negative DAG Learning from Time-Series Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07267v1)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work aims to learn the directed acyclic graph (DAG) that captures the instantaneous dependencies underlying a multivariate time series. The observed data follow a linear structural vector autoregressive model (SVARM) with both instantaneous and time-lagged dependencies, where the instantaneous structure is modeled by a DAG to reflect potential causal relationships. While recent continuous relaxation approaches impose acyclicity through smooth constraint functions involving powers of the adjacency matrix, they lead to non-convex optimization problems that are challenging to solve. In contrast, we assume that the underlying DAG has only non-negative edge weights, and leverage this additional structure to impose acyclicity via a convex constraint. This enables us to cast the problem of non-negative DAG recovery from multivariate time-series data as a convex optimization problem in abstract form, which we solve using the method of multipliers. Crucially, the convex formulation guarantees global optimality of the solution. Finally, we assess the performance of the proposed method on synthetic time-series data, where it outperforms existing alternatives.</p></details> |  |
| **[Emergent Granger Causality in Neural Networks: Can Prediction Alone Reveal Structure?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20347v2)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Granger Causality (GC) offers an elegant statistical framework to study the association between multivariate time series data. Vector autoregressive models (VAR) are simple and easy to fit, but have limited application because of their inherent inability to capture more complex (e.g., non-linear) associations. Numerous attempts have already been made in the literature that exploit the functional approximation power of deep neural networks (DNNs) for GC. However, these methods treat GC as a variable selection problem. We present a novel paradigm for investigating the learned GC from a single neural network used for joint modeling of all components of multivariate time series data, which is essentially linked with prediction and assessing the distribution shift in residuals. A deep learning model, with proper regularization, may learn the true GC structure when jointly used for all components of the time series when there is sufficient training data. We propose to uncover the learned GC structure by comparing the model uncertainty or distribution of the residuals when the past of everything is used as compared to the one where a specific time series component is dropped from the model. We also compare the effect of input layer dropout on the ability of a neural network to learn GC. We show that a well-regularized model can learn the true GC structure from the data without explicitly adding terms in the loss function that guide the model to select variables or perform sparse regression under specific settings. We also provide a comparison of deep learning architectures such as CNN, LSTM and transformer models on their ability to discover Granger Causality. The numerical experiments demonstrate that, compared to sparse regression models, a simple joint model is a strong baseline for learning the true GC which has the advantage that it does not require tuning of many extra hyper-parameters.</p></details> |  |
| **[UniDiff: A Unified Diffusion Framework for Multimodal Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07184v1)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As multimodal data proliferates across diverse real-world applications, leveraging heterogeneous information such as texts and timestamps for accurate time series forecasting (TSF) has become a critical challenge. While diffusion models demonstrate exceptional performance in generation tasks, their application to TSF remains largely confined to modeling single-modality numerical sequences, overlooking the abundant cross-modal signals inherent in complex heterogeneous data. To address this gap, we propose UniDiff, a unified diffusion framework for multimodal time series forecasting. To process the numerical sequence, our framework first tokenizes the time series into patches, preserving local temporal dynamics by mapping each patch to an embedding space via a lightweight MLP. At its core lies a unified and parallel fusion module, where a single cross-attention mechanism adaptively weighs and integrates structural information from timestamps and semantic context from texts in one step, enabling a flexible and efficient interplay between modalities. Furthermore, we introduce a novel classifier-free guidance mechanism designed for multi-source conditioning, allowing for decoupled control over the guidance strength of textual and temporal information during inference, which significantly enhances model robustness. Extensive experiments on real-world benchmark datasets across eight domains demonstrate that the proposed UniDiff model achieves state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[AR-sieve Bootstrap for High-dimensional Time Series](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.00414v2)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper proposes a new AR-sieve bootstrap approach to high-dimensional time series. The major challenge of classical bootstrap methods on high-dimensional time series is two-fold: curse of dimensionality and temporal dependence. To address such a difficulty, we utilize factor modeling to reduce dimension and capture temporal dependence simultaneously. A factor-based bootstrap procedure is constructed, which performs an AR-sieve bootstrap on the extracted low-dimensional common factor time series and then recovers the bootstrap samples for the original data from the factor model. Asymptotic properties for bootstrap mean statistics and extreme eigenvalues are established. Various simulation studies further demonstrate the advantages of the new AR-sieve bootstrap in high-dimensional scenarios. An empirical application on particulate matter (PM) concentration data is studied, where bootstrap confidence intervals for mean vectors and autocovariance matrices are provided.</p></details> |  |
| **[Thicker and Quicker: A Jumbo Token for Fast Plain Vision Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15021v3)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>ViTs are general and accurate, and address many tasks, but ViTs are slow, and are not always practical when efficiency is key. Existing methods for faster ViTs design hybrid non-ViT architectures, losing generality, or shrink their tokens, sacrificing accuracy. While many non-ViT architectures are both fast and accurate, they cannot flexibly process other input shapes, pre-train by SOTA self-supervised learning, reduce computation by dropping tokens, and more like ViTs can. We make ViTs faster by reducing patch token width while increasing global token width by adding a new Jumbo token. Our wider Jumbo token is processed by its own wider FFN to increase model capacity. Yet our Jumbo FFN is efficient: it processes a single token, for speed, and its parameters are shared across all layers, for memory. Crucially, our Jumbo is attention-only and non-hierarchical, like a plain ViT, so it is simple, scalable, flexible, and compatible with ViT methods new and old. Jumbo improves over ViT baselines with Registers from Nano to Large scales while maintaining speed/throughput on ImageNet-1K (0.1-13%). Jumbo also improves MAE pre-training (4.9% linear probing on ImageNet-1K), test-time adaptation (5.2% on ImageNet-C), and time series modeling. Our Jumbo models even achieve better speed-accuracy trade-offs than specialized non-ViT compute-efficient models, while maintaining plain-ViT compatibility for practicality.

We formalize this challenge as a problem of composite neural architecture search (NAS), where multiple source-specific modules and a fusion module are jointly optimized. Existing NAS methods overlook useful side information from the intermediate outputs of these modules -- such as their representation quality -- limiting sample efficiency in multi-source RL settings. To address this, we propose an LLM-driven NAS pipeline that leverages language-model priors and intermediate-output signals to guide sample-efficient search for high-performing composite state encoders. On a mixed-autonomy traffic control task, our approach discovers higher-performing architectures with fewer candidate evaluations than traditional NAS baselines and the LLM-based GENIUS framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025 Workshop on Bridging Language, Agent, and World Models for Reasoning and Planning</p></details> |

The TSGGM structure is encoded in the inverse power spectral density (IPSD) of the time series. In several existing works, one is interested in estimating the difference in two precision matrices to characterize underlying changes in conditional dependencies of two sets of data consisting of independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) observations. In this paper we consider estimation of the difference in two IPSDs to characterize the underlying changes in conditional dependencies of two sets of time-dependent data. Our approach accounts for data time dependencies unlike past work. We analyze a penalized D-trace loss function approach in the frequency domain for differential graph learning, using Wirtinger calculus. We consider both convex (group lasso) and non-convex (log-sum and SCAD group penalties) penalty/regularization functions. An alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm is presented to optimize the objective function. We establish sufficient conditions in a high-dimensional setting for consistency (convergence of the inverse power spectral density to true value in the Frobenius norm) and graph recovery. Both synthetic and real data examples are presented in support of the proposed approaches. In synthetic data examples, our log-sum-penalized differential time-series graph estimator significantly outperformed our lasso based differential time-series graph estimator which, in turn, significantly outperformed an existing lasso-penalized i.i.d. modeling approach, with $F_1$ score as the performance metric.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 4 figures, 2 tables.

| **[Hidden Leaks in Time Series Forecasting: How Data Leakage Affects LSTM Evaluation Across Configurations and Validation Strategies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06932v1)** | 2025-12-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning models, particularly Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, are widely used in time series forecasting due to their ability to capture complex temporal dependencies. However, evaluation integrity is often compromised by data leakage, a methodological flaw in which input-output sequences are constructed before dataset partitioning, allowing future information to unintentionally influence training. This study investigates the impact of data leakage on performance, focusing on how validation design mediates leakage sensitivity. Three widely used validation techniques (2-way split, 3-way split, and 10-fold cross-validation) are evaluated under both leaky (pre-split sequence generation) and clean conditions, with the latter mitigating leakage risk by enforcing temporal separation during data splitting prior to sequence construction. The effect of leakage is assessed using RMSE Gain, which measures the relative increase in RMSE caused by leakage, computed as the percentage difference between leaky and clean setups. Empirical results show that 10-fold cross-validation exhibits RMSE Gain values of up to 20.5% at extended lag steps. In contrast, 2-way and 3-way splits demonstrate greater robustness, typically maintaining RMSE Gain below 5% across diverse configurations. Moreover, input window size and lag step significantly influence leakage sensitivity: smaller windows and longer lags increase the risk of leakage, whereas larger windows help reduce it. These findings underscore the need for configuration-aware, leakage-resistant evaluation pipelines to ensure reliable performance estimation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adaptive Normalization Mamba with Multi Scale Trend Decomposition and Patch MoE Encoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06929v1)** | 2025-12-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting in real world environments faces significant challenges non stationarity, multi scale temporal patterns, and distributional shifts that degrade model stability and accuracy. This study propose AdaMamba, a unified forecasting architecture that integrates adaptive normalization, multi scale trend extraction, and contextual sequence modeling to address these challenges. AdaMamba begins with an Adaptive Normalization Block that removes non stationary components through multi scale convolutional trend extraction and channel wise recalibration, enabling consistent detrending and variance stabilization. The normalized sequence is then processed by a Context Encoder that combines patch wise embeddings, positional encoding, and a Mamba enhanced Transformer layer with a mixture of experts feed forward module, allowing efficient modeling of both long range dependencies and local temporal dynamics. A lightweight prediction head generates multi horizon forecasts, and a denormalization mechanism reconstructs outputs by reintegrating local trends to ensure robustness under varying temporal conditions. AdaMamba provides strong representational capacity with modular extensibility, supporting deterministic prediction and compatibility with probabilistic extensions. Its design effectively mitigates covariate shift and enhances predictive reliability across heterogeneous datasets. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that AdaMamba's combination of adaptive normalization and expert augmented contextual modeling yields consistent improvements in stability and accuracy over conventional Transformer based baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evaluating the Sensitivity of BiLSTM Forecasting Models to Sequence Length and Input Noise](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06926v1)** | 2025-12-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning (DL) models, a specialized class of multilayer neural networks, have become central to time-series forecasting in critical domains such as environmental monitoring and the Internet of Things (IoT). Among these, Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) architectures are particularly effective in capturing complex temporal dependencies. However, the robustness and generalization of such models are highly sensitive to input data characteristics - an aspect that remains underexplored in existing literature. This study presents a systematic empirical analysis of two key data-centric factors: input sequence length and additive noise. To support this investigation, a modular and reproducible forecasting pipeline is developed, incorporating standardized preprocessing, sequence generation, model training, validation, and evaluation. Controlled experiments are conducted on three real-world datasets with varying sampling frequencies to assess BiLSTM performance under different input conditions. The results yield three key findings: (1) longer input sequences significantly increase the risk of overfitting and data leakage, particularly in data-constrained environments; (2) additive noise consistently degrades predictive accuracy across sampling frequencies; and (3) the simultaneous presence of both factors results in the most substantial decline in model stability. While datasets with higher observation frequencies exhibit greater robustness, they remain vulnerable when both input challenges are present. These findings highlight important limitations in current DL-based forecasting pipelines and underscore the need for data-aware design strategies. This work contributes to a deeper understanding of DL model behavior in dynamic time-series environments and provides practical insights for developing more reliable and generalizable forecasting systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mask the Redundancy: Evolving Masking Representation Learning for Multivariate Time-Series Clustering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17008v2)** | 2025-12-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multivariate Time-Series (MTS) clustering discovers intrinsic grouping patterns of temporal data samples. Although time-series provide rich discriminative information, they also contain substantial redundancy, such as steady-state machine operation records and zero-output periods of solar power generation. Such redundancy diminishes the attention given to discriminative timestamps in representation learning, thus leading to performance bottlenecks in MTS clustering. Masking has been widely adopted to enhance the MTS representation, where temporal reconstruction tasks are designed to capture critical information from MTS. However, most existing masking strategies appear to be standalone preprocessing steps, isolated from the learning process, which hinders dynamic adaptation to the importance of clustering-critical timestamps. Accordingly, this paper proposes the Evolving-masked MTS Clustering (EMTC) method, whose model architecture comprises Importance-aware Variate-wise Masking (IVM) and Multi-Endogenous Views (MEV) generation modules. IVM adaptively guides the model in learning more discriminative representations for clustering, while the reconstruction and cluster-guided contrastive learning pathways enhance and connect the representation learning to clustering tasks. Extensive experiments on 15 benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of EMTC over eight SOTA methods, where the EMTC achieves an average improvement of 4.85% in F1-Score over the strongest baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AAAI 2026</p></details> |
| **[Neural Factorization-based Bearing Fault Diagnosis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06837v1)** | 2025-12-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper studies the key problems of bearing fault diagnosis of high-speed train. As the core component of the train operation system, the health of bearings is directly related to the safety of train operation. The traditional diagnostic methods are facing the challenge of insufficient diagnostic accuracy under complex conditions. To solve these problems, we propose a novel Neural Factorization-based Classification (NFC) framework for bearing fault diagnosis. It is built on two core idea: 1) Embedding vibration time series into multiple mode-wise latent feature vectors to capture diverse fault-related patterns; 2) Leveraging neural factorization principles to fuse these vectors into a unified vibration representation. This design enables effective mining of complex latent fault characteristics from raw time-series data. We further instantiate the framework with two models CP-NFC and Tucker-NFC based on CP and Tucker fusion schemes, respectively. Experimental results show that both models achieve superior diagnostic performance compared with traditional machine learning methods. The comparative analysis provides valuable empirical evidence and practical guidance for selecting effective diagnostic strategies in high-speed train bearing monitoring.</p></details> |  |

We propose Parameter--Space Changepoint Detection (Param--CPD), a two--stage framework that first amortizes Bayesian inference of governing parameters with a neural posterior estimator trained by simulation-based inference, and then applies a standard CPD algorithm to the resulting parameter trajectory. On Lorenz--63 with piecewise-constant parameters, Param--CPD improves F1, reduces localization error, and lowers false positives compared to observation--space baselines. We further verify identifiability and calibration of the inferred posteriors on stationary trajectories, explaining why parameter space offers a cleaner detection signal. Robustness analyses over tolerance, window length, and noise indicate consistent gains. Our results show that operating in a physically interpretable parameter space enables accurate and interpretable changepoint detection in nonlinear dynamical systems.</p></details> | 15 pages |

While comprehensive ensembles like HIVE-COTE 2.0 achieve state-of-the-art accuracy, their 340-hour training time on the UCR benchmark renders them impractical for large-scale datasets. We investigate whether targeted combinations of two efficient algorithms from complementary paradigms can capture ensemble benefits while maintaining computational feasibility. Combining Hydra (competing convolutional kernels) and Quant (hierarchical interval quantiles) across six ensemble configurations, we evaluate performance on 10 large-scale MONSTER datasets (7,898 to 1,168,774 training instances). Our strongest configuration improves mean accuracy from 0.829 to 0.836, succeeding on 7 of 10 datasets. However, prediction-combination ensembles capture only 11% of theoretical oracle potential, revealing a substantial meta-learning optimization gap. Feature-concatenation approaches exceeded oracle bounds by learning novel decision boundaries, while prediction-level complementarity shows moderate correlation with ensemble gains. The central finding: the challenge has shifted from ensuring algorithms are different to learning how to combine them effectively. Current meta-learning strategies struggle to exploit the complementarity that oracle analysis confirms exists. Improved combination strategies could potentially double or triple ensemble gains across diverse time series classification applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Link ...</summary><p>Link to the repository: https://github.com/urav06/research</p></details> |

We propose the Full-State Graph Convolutional LSTM (FS-GCLSTM), a novel temporal graph neural network that incorporates value-chain relationships to enhance stock return forecasting. Our approach features two key innovations: First, we represent inter-firm dependencies through value-chain networks, where nodes correspond to companies and edges capture supplier-customer relationships, enabling the model to leverage information beyond historical price data. Second, FS-GCLSTM applies graph convolutions to all LSTM components - current input features, previous hidden states, and cell states - ensuring that spatial information from the value-chain network influences every aspect of the temporal update mechanism. We evaluate FS-GCLSTM on Eurostoxx 600 and S&P 500 datasets using LSEG value-chain data. While not achieving the lowest traditional prediction errors, FS-GCLSTM consistently delivers superior portfolio performance, attaining the highest annualized returns, Sharpe ratios, and Sortino ratios across both markets. Performance gains are more pronounced in the denser Eurostoxx 600 network, and robustness tests confirm stability across different input sequence lengths, demonstrating the practical value of integrating value-chain data with temporal graph neural networks.</p></details> |  |

This precludes the backtests typically employed in finance since retraining frontier models from scratch with a specific knowledge cutoff is prohibitive. In this paper, we introduce a fast, effective, and low-cost alternative. Our method guides generation at inference time by adjusting the logits of a large base model using a pair of smaller, specialized models -- one fine-tuned on information to be forgotten and another on information to be retained. We demonstrate that our method effectively removes both verbatim and semantic knowledge, corrects biases, and outperforms prior methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Remote Sensing to Multiple Time Horizons Forecasts: Transformers Model for CyanoHAB Intensity in Lake Champlain](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06598v1)** | 2025-12-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cyanobacterial Harmful Algal Blooms (CyanoHABs) pose significant threats to aquatic ecosystems and public health globally. Lake Champlain is particularly vulnerable to recurring CyanoHAB events, especially in its northern segment: Missisquoi Bay, St. Albans Bay, and Northeast Arm, due to nutrient enrichment and climatic variability. Remote sensing provides a scalable solution for monitoring and forecasting these events, offering continuous coverage where in situ observations are sparse or unavailable. In this study, we present a remote sensing only forecasting framework that combines Transformers and BiLSTM to predict CyanoHAB intensities up to 14 days in advance. The system utilizes Cyanobacterial Index data from the Cyanobacterial Assessment Network and temperature data from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer satellites to capture long range dependencies and sequential dynamics in satellite time series. The dataset is very sparse, missing more than 30% of the Cyanobacterial Index data and 90% of the temperature data. A two stage preprocessing pipeline addressed data gaps by applying forward fill and weighted temporal imputation at the pixel level, followed by smoothing to reduce the discontinuities of CyanoHAB events. The raw dataset is transformed into meaningful features through equal frequency binning for the Cyanobacterial Index values and extracted temperature statistics. Transformer BiLSTM model demonstrates strong forecasting performance across multiple horizons, achieving F1 scores of 89.5%, 86.4%, and 85.5% at one, two, and three-day forecasts, respectively, and maintaining an F1 score of 78.9% with an AUC of 82.6% at the 14-day horizon. These results confirm the model's ability to capture complex spatiotemporal dynamics from sparse satellite data and to provide reliable early warning for CyanoHABs management.</p></details> | 23 pages, 15 figures |

To address these challenges, we construct scale and fluctuation-dependent correlation matrices using the multifractal detrended cross-correlation coefficient $ρ_r$ that selectively emphasizes fluctuations of different amplitudes. We examine the spectral properties of these detrended correlation matrices and compare them to the spectral properties of the matrices calculated in the same way from synthetic Gaussian and $q$Gaussian signals. Our results show that detrending, heavy tails, and the fluctuation-order parameter $r$ jointly produce spectra, which substantially depart from the random case even under absence of cross-correlations in time series. Applying this framework to one-minute returns of 140 major cryptocurrencies from 2021-2024 reveals robust collective modes, including a dominant market factor and several sectoral components whose strength depends on the analyzed scale and fluctuation order. After filtering out the market mode, the empirical eigenvalue bulk aligns closely with the limit of random detrended cross-correlations, enabling clear identification of structurally significant outliers. Overall, the study provides a refined spectral baseline for detrended cross-correlations and offers a promising tool for distinguishing genuine interdependencies from noise in complex, nonstationary, heavy-tailed systems.</p></details> |  |

However, in applications, autoregressive signals are often corrupted by additive noise. Further, the autoregressive process and the corruptive noise may be highly impulsive, stemming from an infinite-variance distribution. The model estimation techniques that account for additional noise tend to show reduced efficacy when there is very strong noise present in the data, especially when the noise is heavy-tailed. In this paper, we propose a novel self-supervised learning method to denoise the additive noise-corrupted autoregressive model. Our approach is motivated by recent work in computer vision and does not require full knowledge of the noise distribution. We use the proposed method to recover exemplary finite- and infinite-variance autoregressive signals, namely, Gaussian and alpha-stable distributed signals, respectively, from their noise-corrupted versions. The simulation study conducted on both synthetic and semi-synthetic data demonstrates strong denoising performance of our method compared to several baseline methods, particularly when the corruption is significant and impulsive in nature. Finally, we apply the presented methodology to forecast the pure autoregressive signal from the noise-corrupted data.</p></details> | 38 pages, 22 figures |

Artificial intelligence techniques, which use a neural network component in various forms, have recently frequently been used to accomplish this step. However, the complexity of the neural network structure still stands up as a critical problem against prediction accuracy. In this paper, a method inspired by the proportional-integral-derivative (PID) control approach is investigated to enhance the performance of neural network models used for multi-step ahead prediction of periodic time-series information while maintaining a negligible impact on the complexity of the system. The PID-based method is applied to the predicted value at each time step to bring that value closer to the real value. The water demand forecasting problem is considered as a case study, where two deep neural network models from the literature are used to prove the effectiveness of the proposed boosting method. Furthermore, to prove the applicability of this PID-based booster to other types of periodic time-series prediction problems, it is applied to enhance the accuracy of a neural network model used for multi-step forecasting of hourly energy consumption. The comparison between the results of the original prediction models and the results after using the proposed technique demonstrates the superiority of the proposed method in terms of prediction accuracy and system complexity.</p></details> | <details><summary>Engin...</summary><p>Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence 2022</p></details> |

The model natively supports heterogeneous features including continuous, binary, and categorical variables. We unify all tasks using a masked-modeling strategy in which a binary mask specifies which time-series cells are observed and which must be generated. TimeAutoDiff combines a lightweight variational autoencoder, which maps mixed-type features into a continuous latent sequence, with a diffusion model that learns temporal dynamics in this latent space. Two architectural choices provide strong speed and scalability benefits. The diffusion model samples an entire latent trajectory at once rather than denoising one timestep at a time, greatly reducing reverse-diffusion calls. In addition, the VAE compresses along the feature axis, enabling efficient modeling of wide tables in a low-dimensional latent space. Empirical evaluation shows that TimeAutoDiff matches or surpasses strong baselines in synthetic sequence fidelity and consistently improves imputation and forecasting performance. Metadata conditioning enables realistic scenario exploration, allowing users to edit metadata sequences and produce coherent counterfactual trajectories that preserve cross-feature dependencies. Ablation studies highlight the importance of the VAE's feature encoding and key components of the denoiser. A distance-to-closest-record audit further indicates that the model generalizes without excessive memorization. Code is available at https://github.com/namjoonsuh/TimeAutoDiff</p></details> |  |

Here we investigate a time-series foundation model, that is, a large pre-trained time-series model for capacity degradation forecasting, and propose a degradation-aware fine-tuning strategy that aligns the model to capacity trajectories while retaining broadly transferable temporal structure. We instantiate this approach by fine-tuning the Timer model on 220,153 cycles of open-source charge-discharge records to obtain Battery-Timer. Using our released CycleLife-SJTUIE dataset, a real-world industrial collection from an energy-storage station with long-horizon cycling, we evaluate capacity generalization from small cells to large-scale storage systems and across varying operating conditions. Battery-Timer consistently outperforms specialized expert models. To address deployment cost, we further introduce knowledge distillation, a teacher-student transfer that compresses the foundation model's behavior into compact expert models. Distillation across several state-of-the-art time-series experts improves multi-condition capacity generalization while substantially reducing computational overhead, indicating a practical path to deployable cross-scale degradation forecasting by combining a foundation model with targeted distillation.</p></details> |  |

In order to test the inverse model, a synthetic dataset is created by running the model in forward mode with known parameter values to create soil temperature time series that can be used as observations for the inverse model. We show that it is not possible to obtain a reliable parameter estimation using a time series of soil temperature observed at a single depth. Using measurements at two depths, reliable parameter estimates can be obtained although it is not possible to differentiate between latent and sensible heat fluxes. We apply the inverse model to urban flux tower data in Phoenix, United States, and show that the thermal conductivity, volumetric heat capacity and the combined sensible-latent heat transfer coefficient can be reliably estimated using an observed value for the effective surface albedo. The resulting model accurately predicts the outgoing longwave radiation, conductive soil fluxes and the combined sensible-latent heat fluxes.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 5 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |
| **[Establishing Validity for Distance Functions and Internal Clustering Validity Indices in Correlation Space](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16497v2)** | 2025-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Internal clustering validity indices (ICVIs) assess clustering quality without ground truth labels. Comparative studies consistently find that no single ICVI outperforms others across datasets, leaving practitioners without principled ICVI selection. We argue that inconsistent ICVI performance arises because studies evaluate them based on matching human labels rather than measuring the quality of the discovered structure in the data, using datasets without formally quantifying the structure type and quality. Structure type refers to the mathematical organisation in data that clustering aims to discover. Validity theory requires a theoretical definition of clustering quality, which depends on structure type. We demonstrate this through the first validity assessment of clustering quality measures for correlation patterns, a structure type that arises from clustering time series by correlation relationships. We formalise 23 canonical correlation patterns as the theoretical optimal clustering and use synthetic data modelling this structure with controlled perturbations to evaluate validity across content, criterion, construct, and external validity. Our findings show that Silhouette Width Criterion (SWC) and Davies-Bouldin Index (DBI) are valid for correlation patterns, whilst Calinski-Harabasz (VRC) and Pakhira-Bandyopadhyay-Maulik (PBM) indices fail. Simple Lp norm distances achieve validity, whilst correlation-specific functions fail structural, criterion, and external validity. These results differ from previous studies where VRC and PBM performed well, demonstrating that validity depends on structure type. Our structure-type-specific validation method provides both practical guidance (quality thresholds SWC>0.9, DBI<0.15) and a methodological template for establishing validity for other structure types.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages (51 total), 10 figs. v2: Reframed using validity theory - only valid ICVIs/DFs ranked.

However, many researchers have argued that this bias does not apply when using cross-validation with vector autoregressions (VAR) or with time series models whose errors follow a martingale-like structure. I show that even under these circumstances, performing cross-validation on time series data will still generate bias in general.</p></details> |  |

Beginning with Bayes' theorem and the philosophical distinctions between Bayesian and frequentist approaches, we develop the inferential framework for estimation, interval construction, hypothesis testing, and prediction. Through canonical models, we illustrate how prior information and observed data are formally integrated to yield posterior distributions. We also explore key concepts including loss functions, credible intervals, Bayes factors, identifiability, and asymptotic behavior. While emphasizing analytical tractability in classical settings, we outline modern extensions that rely on simulation-based methods and discuss challenges related to prior specification and model evaluation. Though focused on foundational ideas, this paper sets the stage for applying Bayesian methods in contemporary domains such as hierarchical modeling, nonparametrics, and structured applications in time series, spatial data, networks, and political science. The goal is to provide a rigorous yet accessible entry point for students and researchers seeking to adopt a Bayesian perspective in statistical practice.</p></details> | <details><summary>56 pa...</summary><p>56 pages, 1 table, 0 figures</p></details> |

Built on transformer architectures, BERTO delivers high prediction accuracy, while its Balancing Loss Function and prompt-based customization allow operators to adjust the trade-off between power savings and performance. Natural language prompts guide the model to manage underprediction and overprediction in accordance with the operator's intent. Experiments on real-world datasets show that BERTO improves upon existing models with a $4.13$\% reduction in MSE while introducing the feature of balancing competing objectives of power saving and performance through simple natural language inputs, operating over a flexible range of $1.4$ kW in power and up to $9\times$ variation in service quality, making it well suited for intelligent RAN deployments.</p></details> |  |
| **[IdealTSF: Can Non-Ideal Data Contribute to Enhancing the Performance of Time Series Forecasting Models?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05442v1)** | 2025-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning has shown strong performance in time series forecasting tasks. However, issues such as missing values and anomalies in sequential data hinder its further development in prediction tasks. Previous research has primarily focused on extracting feature information from sequence data or addressing these suboptimal data as positive samples for knowledge transfer. A more effective approach would be to leverage these non-ideal negative samples to enhance event prediction. In response, this study highlights the advantages of non-ideal negative samples and proposes the IdealTSF framework, which integrates both ideal positive and negative samples for time series forecasting. IdealTSF consists of three progressive steps: pretraining, training, and optimization. It first pretrains the model by extracting knowledge from negative sample data, then transforms the sequence data into ideal positive samples during training. Additionally, a negative optimization mechanism with adversarial disturbances is applied. Extensive experiments demonstrate that negative sample data unlocks significant potential within the basic attention architecture for time series forecasting. Therefore, IdealTSF is particularly well-suited for applications with noisy samples or low-quality data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at AAAI 2026</p></details> |

We propose a novel, interpretable additive model tailored for such data, designed to deliver both high predictive accuracy and clear interpretability. The model features bivariate coefficient surfaces to represent relationships across panel dimensions, with sparsity introduced via penalized smoothing and group bridge regression. This enables simultaneous estimation of the surfaces and identification of significant inter-dimensional effects. Through Monte Carlo simulations and an empirical application to Japanese subnational age-specific mortality rates, we demonstrate the proposed model's superior forecasting performance and interpretability compared to existing functional time series approaches.</p></details> |  |

However, this leads to a loss of temporal dynamics. Moreover, these methods require a large amount of data for effective training. In this paper, we propose TS-Hint, a Time Series Foundation Model (TSFM) framework, integrated with chain-of-thought reasoning which provides attention hints during training based on attention mechanism data and saliency data. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our model in limited data settings via few-shot learning and can learn directly from multivariate time series features.</p></details> |  |
| **[Smart Timing for Mining: A Deep Learning Framework for Bitcoin Hardware ROI Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05402v1)** | 2025-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Bitcoin mining hardware acquisition requires strategic timing due to volatile markets, rapid technological obsolescence, and protocol-driven revenue cycles. Despite mining's evolution into a capital-intensive industry, there is little guidance on when to purchase new Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) hardware, and no prior computational frameworks address this decision problem. We address this gap by formulating hardware acquisition as a time series classification task, predicting whether purchasing ASIC machines yields profitable (Return on Investment (ROI) >= 1), marginal (0 < ROI < 1), or unprofitable (ROI <= 0) returns within one year. We propose MineROI-Net, an open source Transformer-based architecture designed to capture multi-scale temporal patterns in mining profitability. Evaluated on data from 20 ASIC miners released between 2015 and 2024 across diverse market regimes, MineROI-Net outperforms LSTM-based and TSLANet baselines, achieving 83.7% accuracy and 83.1% macro F1-score. The model demonstrates strong economic relevance, achieving 93.6% precision in detecting unprofitable periods and 98.5% precision for profitable ones, while avoiding misclassification of profitable scenarios as unprofitable and vice versa. These results indicate that MineROI-Net offers a practical, data-driven tool for timing mining hardware acquisitions, potentially reducing financial risk in capital-intensive mining operations. The model is available through: https://github.com/AMAAI-Lab/MineROI-Net.</p></details> |  |

We present a systematic evaluation of tokenization approaches for clinical time series modeling using transformer-based architectures, revealing task-dependent and sometimes counterintuitive findings about temporal and value feature importance. Through controlled ablations across four clinical prediction tasks on MIMIC-IV, we demonstrate that explicit time encodings provide no consistent statistically significant benefit for the evaluated downstream tasks. Value features show task-dependent importance, affecting mortality prediction but not readmission, suggesting code sequences alone can carry sufficient predictive signal. We further show that frozen pretrained code encoders dramatically outperform their trainable counterparts while requiring dramatically fewer parameters. Larger clinical encoders provide consistent improvements across tasks, benefiting from frozen embeddings that eliminate computational overhead. Our controlled evaluation enables fairer tokenization comparisons and demonstrates that simpler, parameter-efficient approaches can, in many cases, achieve strong performance, though the optimal tokenization strategy remains task-dependent.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 2 figures, 4 tables.

| **[RAMEN: Resolution-Adjustable Multimodal Encoder for Earth Observation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05025v1)** | 2025-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Earth observation (EO) data spans a wide range of spatial, spectral, and temporal resolutions, from high-resolution optical imagery to low resolution multispectral products or radar time series. While recent foundation models have improved multimodal integration for learning meaningful representations, they often expect fixed input resolutions or are based on sensor-specific encoders limiting generalization across heterogeneous EO modalities. To overcome these limitations we introduce RAMEN, a resolution-adjustable multimodal encoder that learns a shared visual representation across EO data in a fully sensor-agnostic manner. RAMEN treats the modality and spatial and temporal resolutions as key input data features, enabling coherent analysis across modalities within a unified latent space. Its main methodological contribution is to define spatial resolution as a controllable output parameter, giving users direct control over the desired level of detail at inference and allowing explicit trade-offs between spatial precision and computational cost. We train a single, unified transformer encoder reconstructing masked multimodal EO data drawn from diverse sources, ensuring generalization across sensors and resolutions. Once pretrained, RAMEN transfers effectively to both known and unseen sensor configurations and outperforms larger state-of-the-art models on the community-standard PANGAEA benchmark, containing various multi-sensor and multi-resolution downstream tasks. Our code and pretrained model are available at https://github.com/nicolashoudre/RAMEN.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unsupervised Time Series Anomaly Prediction with Importance-based Generative Contrastive Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16888v3)** | 2025-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series anomaly prediction plays an essential role in many real-world scenarios, such as environmental prevention and prompt maintenance of cyber-physical systems. However, existing time series anomaly prediction methods mainly require supervised training with plenty of manually labeled data, which are difficult to obtain in practice. Besides, unseen anomalies can occur during inference, which could differ from the labeled training data and make these models fail to predict such new anomalies. In this paper, we study a novel problem of unsupervised time series anomaly prediction. We provide a theoretical analysis and propose Importance-based Generative Contrastive Learning (IGCL) to address the aforementioned problems. IGCL distinguishes between normal and anomaly precursors, which are generated by our anomaly precursor pattern generation module. To address the efficiency issues caused by the potential complex anomaly precursor combinations, we propose a memory bank with importance-based scores to adaptively store representative anomaly precursors and generate more complicated anomaly precursors. Extensive experiments on seven benchmark datasets show our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on unsupervised time series anomaly prediction problems.</p></details> | ACM SIGKDD 2025 |
| **[Entropic Analysis of Time Series through Kernel Density Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18916v2)** | 2025-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work presents a novel framework for time series analysis using entropic measures based on the kernel density estimate (KDE) of the time series' Takens' embeddings. Using this framework we introduce two distinct analytical tools: (1) a multi-scale KDE entropy metric, denoted as $Δ\text{KE}$, which quantifies the evolution of time series complexity across different scales by measuring certain entropy changes, and (2) a sliding baseline method that employs the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence to detect changes in time series dynamics through changes in KDEs. The $Δ{\rm KE}$ metric offers insights into the information content and ``unfolding'' properties of the time series' embedding related to dynamical systems, while the KL divergence-based approach provides a noise and outlier robust approach for identifying time series change points (injections in RF signals, e.g.). We demonstrate the versatility and effectiveness of these tools through a set of experiments encompassing diverse domains. In the space of radio frequency (RF) signal processing, we achieve accurate detection of signal injections under varying noise and interference conditions. Furthermore, we apply our methodology to electrocardiography (ECG) data, successfully identifying instances of ventricular fibrillation with high accuracy. Finally, we demonstrate the potential of our tools for dynamic state detection by accurately identifying chaotic regimes within an intermittent signal. These results show the broad applicability of our framework for extracting meaningful insights from complex time series data across various scientific disciplines.</p></details> |  |
| **[STELLA: Guiding Large Language Models for Time Series Forecasting with Semantic Abstractions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04871v1)** | 2025-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent adaptations of Large Language Models (LLMs) for time series forecasting often fail to effectively enhance information for raw series, leaving LLM reasoning capabilities underutilized. Existing prompting strategies rely on static correlations rather than generative interpretations of dynamic behavior, lacking critical global and instance-specific context. To address this, we propose STELLA (Semantic-Temporal Alignment with Language Abstractions), a framework that systematically mines and injects structured supplementary and complementary information. STELLA employs a dynamic semantic abstraction mechanism that decouples input series into trend, seasonality, and residual components. It then translates intrinsic behavioral features of these components into Hierarchical Semantic Anchors: a Corpus-level Semantic Prior (CSP) for global context and a Fine-grained Behavioral Prompt (FBP) for instance-level patterns. Using these anchors as prefix-prompts, STELLA guides the LLM to model intrinsic dynamics. Experiments on eight benchmark datasets demonstrate that STELLA outperforms state-of-the-art methods in long- and short-term forecasting, showing superior generalization in zero-shot and few-shot settings. Ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of our dynamically generated semantic anchors.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |

Where $ε$-machines capture the predictive temporal structure and intrinsic computation of ABM-generated time series, diffusion models characterize high-dimensional cross-sectional distributions, learn underlying data manifolds, and enable synthetic generation of plausible population-level outcomes. We provide a formal analysis demonstrating that the two approaches operate on distinct mathematical domains -- processes vs. distributions -- and show that their combination yields a two-axis representation of ABM behavior based on temporal organization and distributional geometry. To our knowledge, this is the first framework to integrate computational mechanics with score-based generative modeling for the structural analysis of ABM outputs, thereby situating ABM characterization within the broader landscape of modern machine-learning methods for density estimation and intrinsic computation. The framework is validated using the same elder-caregiver ABM dataset introduced in the companion paper, and we provide precise definitions and propositions formalizing the mathematical complementarity between $ε$-machines and diffusion models. This establishes a principled methodology for jointly analyzing temporal predictability and high-dimensional distributional structure in complex simulation models.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages.

The non-differentiability and sparsity of the spiking mechanism can make these models very difficult to train with algorithms based on propagating gradients through the spiking non-linearity. We address this problem by adapting the paradigm of Random Feature Methods (RFMs) from Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) to Spike Response Model (SRM) SNNs. This approach allows training of SNNs without approximation of the spike function gradient. Concretely, we propose a novel data-driven, fast, high-performance, and interpretable algorithm for end-to-end training of SNNs inspired by the SWIM algorithm for RFM-ANNs, which we coin S-SWIM. We provide a thorough theoretical discussion and supplementary numerical experiments showing that S-SWIM can reach high accuracies on time series forecasting as a standalone strategy and serve as an effective initialisation strategy before gradient-based training. Additional ablation studies show that our proposed method performs better than random sampling of network weights.</p></details> | <details><summary>37 pa...</summary><p>37 pages incl. references & appendix, 6 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |
| **[Intelligence Foundation Model: A New Perspective to Approach Artificial General Intelligence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10119v3)** | 2025-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a new perspective for approaching artificial general intelligence (AGI) through an intelligence foundation model (IFM). Unlike existing foundation models (FMs), which specialize in pattern learning within specific domains such as language, vision, or time series, IFM aims to acquire the underlying mechanisms of intelligence by learning directly from diverse intelligent behaviors. Vision, language, and other cognitive abilities are manifestations of intelligent behavior; learning from this broad range of behaviors enables the system to internalize the general principles of intelligence. Based on the fact that intelligent behaviors emerge from the collective dynamics of biological neural systems, IFM consists of two core components: a novel network architecture, termed the state neural network, which captures neuron-like dynamic processes, and a new learning objective, neuron output prediction, which trains the system to predict neuronal outputs from collective dynamics. The state neural network emulates the temporal dynamics of biological neurons, allowing the system to store, integrate, and process information over time, while the neuron output prediction objective provides a unified computational principle for learning these structural dynamics from intelligent behaviors. Together, these innovations establish a biologically grounded and computationally scalable foundation for building systems capable of generalization, reasoning, and adaptive learning across domains, representing a step toward truly AGI.</p></details> |  |
| **[UniTS: Unified Time Series Generative Model for Remote Sensing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04461v1)** | 2025-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>One of the primary objectives of satellite remote sensing is to capture the complex dynamics of the Earth environment, which encompasses tasks such as reconstructing continuous cloud-free time series images, detecting land cover changes, and forecasting future surface evolution. However, existing methods typically require specialized models tailored to different tasks, lacking unified modeling of spatiotemporal features across multiple time series tasks. In this paper, we propose a Unified Time Series Generative Model (UniTS), a general framework applicable to various time series tasks, including time series reconstruction, time series cloud removal, time series semantic change detection, and time series forecasting. Based on the flow matching generative paradigm, UniTS constructs a deterministic evolution path from noise to targets under the guidance of task-specific conditions, achieving unified modeling of spatiotemporal representations for multiple tasks. The UniTS architecture consists of a diffusion transformer with spatio-temporal blocks, where we design an Adaptive Condition Injector (ACor) to enhance the model's conditional perception of multimodal inputs, enabling high-quality controllable generation. Additionally, we design a Spatiotemporal-aware Modulator (STM) to improve the ability of spatio-temporal blocks to capture complex spatiotemporal dependencies. Furthermore, we construct two high-quality multimodal time series datasets, TS-S12 and TS-S12CR, filling the gap of benchmark datasets for time series cloud removal and forecasting tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniTS exhibits exceptional generative and cognitive capabilities in both low-level and high-level time series tasks. It significantly outperforms existing methods, particularly when facing challenges such as severe cloud contamination, modality absence, and forecasting phenological variations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bayesian Graphical High-Dimensional Time Series Models for Detecting Structural Changes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04444v1)** | 2025-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the structural changes in multivariate time-series by estimating and comparing stationary graphs for macroeconomic time series before and after an economic crisis such as the Great Recession. Building on a latent time series framework called Orthogonally-rotated Univariate Time-series (OUT), we propose a shared-parameter framework-the spOUT autoregressive model (spOUTAR)-that jointly models two related multivariate time series and enables coherent Bayesian estimation of their corresponding stationary precision matrices. This framework provides a principled mechanism to detect and quantify which conditional relationships among the variables changed, or formed following the crisis. Specifically, we study the impact of the Great Recession (December 2007-June 2009) that substantially disrupted global and national economies, prompting long-lasting shifts in macroeconomic indicators and their interrelationships. While many studies document its economic consequences, far less is known about how the underlying conditional dependency structure among economic variables changed as economies moved from pre-crisis stability through the shock and back to normalcy. Using the proposed approach to analyze U.S. and OECD macroeconomic data, we demonstrate that spOUTAR effectively captures recession-induced changes in stationary graphical structure, offering a flexible and interpretable tool for studying structural shifts in economic systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Inference-time Stochastic Refinement of GRU-Normalizing Flow for Real-time Video Motion Transfer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04282v1)** | 2025-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-time video motion transfer applications such as immersive gaming and vision-based anomaly detection require accurate yet diverse future predictions to support realistic synthesis and robust downstream decision making under uncertainty. To improve the diversity of such sequential forecasts we propose a novel inference-time refinement technique that combines Gated Recurrent Unit-Normalizing Flows (GRU-NF) with stochastic sampling methods. While GRU-NF can capture multimodal distributions through its integration of normalizing flows within a temporal forecasting framework, its deterministic transformation structure can limit expressivity. To address this, inspired by Stochastic Normalizing Flows (SNF), we introduce Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) steps during GRU-NF inference, enabling the model to explore a richer output space and better approximate the true data distribution without retraining. We validate our approach in a keypoint-based video motion transfer pipeline, where capturing temporally coherent and perceptually diverse future trajectories is essential for realistic samples and low bandwidth communication. Experiments show that our inference framework, Gated Recurrent Unit- Stochastic Normalizing Flows (GRU-SNF) outperforms GRU-NF in generating diverse outputs without sacrificing accuracy, even under longer prediction horizons. By injecting stochasticity during inference, our approach captures multimodal behavior more effectively. These results highlight the potential of integrating stochastic dynamics with flow-based sequence models for generative time series forecasting.</p></details> |  |

We develop a socio-technical explanation for how generative AI enables and scales cybercrime. Drawing on affordance theory and technological amplification, we argue that generative AI systems create new action possibilities for cybercriminals and magnify pre-existing malicious intent by lowering expertise barriers and increasing attack efficiency. To illustrate this framework, we conduct interrupted time series analyses of two large datasets: (1) 464,190,074 malicious IP address reports from AbuseIPDB, and (2) 281,115 cryptocurrency scam reports from Chainabuse. Using November 30, 2022, as a high-salience public-access shock, we estimate the counterfactual trajectory of reported cyber abuse absent the release, providing an early-warning impact assessment of a general-purpose AI technology. Across both datasets, we observe statistically significant post-intervention increases in reported malicious activity, including an immediate increase of over 1.12 million weekly malicious IP reports and about 722 weekly cryptocurrency scam reports, with sustained growth in the latter. We discuss implications for AI governance, platform-level regulation, and cyber resilience, emphasizing the need for multi-layer socio-technical strategies that help key stakeholders maximize AI's benefits while mitigating its growing cybercrime risks.</p></details> |  |

Evaluating user satisfaction with SIAs' performance is a key factor in designing the interaction between the user and SIA. Currently, subjective user satisfaction is primarily assessed manually through questionnaires or indirectly via system metrics. This study examines the automatic classification of user satisfaction through analysis of social signals, aiming to enhance both manual and autonomous evaluation methods for SIAs. During a field trial at the Deutsches Museum Bonn, a Furhat Robotics head was employed as a service and information hub, collecting an "in-the-wild" dataset. This dataset comprises 46 single-user interactions, including questionnaire responses and video data. Our method focuses on automatically classifying user satisfaction based on time series classification. We use time series of social signal metrics derived from the body pose, time series of facial expressions, and physical distance. This study compares three feature engineering approaches on different machine learning models. The results confirm the method's effectiveness in reliably identifying interactions with low user satisfaction without the need for manually annotated datasets. This approach offers significant potential for enhancing SIA performance and user experience through automated feedback mechanisms.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 3 figures.

| **[Training and Evaluation of Guideline-Based Medical Reasoning in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03838v1)** | 2025-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine learning for early prediction in medicine has recently shown breakthrough performance, however, the focus on improving prediction accuracy has led to a neglect of faithful explanations that are required to gain the trust of medical practitioners. The goal of this paper is to teach LLMs to follow medical consensus guidelines step-by-step in their reasoning and prediction process. Since consensus guidelines are ubiquitous in medicine, instantiations of verbalized medical inference rules to electronic health records provide data for fine-tuning LLMs to learn consensus rules and possible exceptions thereof for many medical areas. Consensus rules also enable an automatic evaluation of the model's inference process regarding its derivation correctness (evaluating correct and faithful deduction of a conclusion from given premises) and value correctness (comparing predicted values against real-world measurements). We exemplify our work using the complex Sepsis-3 consensus definition. Our experiments show that small fine-tuned models outperform one-shot learning of considerably larger LLMs that are prompted with the explicit definition and models that are trained on medical texts including consensus definitions. Since fine-tuning on verbalized rule instantiations of a specific medical area yields nearly perfect derivation correctness for rules (and exceptions) on unseen patient data in that area, the bottleneck for early prediction is not out-of-distribution generalization, but the orthogonal problem of generalization into the future by forecasting sparsely and irregularly sampled clinical variables. We show that the latter results can be improved by integrating the output representations of a time series forecasting model with the LLM in a multimodal setup.</p></details> |  |
| **[A comparison between initialization strategies for the infinite hidden Markov model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03777v1)** | 2025-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Infinite hidden Markov models provide a flexible framework for modelling time series with structural changes and complex dynamics, without requiring the number of latent states to be specified in advance. This flexibility is achieved through the hierarchical Dirichlet process prior, while efficient Bayesian inference is enabled by the beam sampler, which combines dynamic programming with slice sampling to truncate the infinite state space adaptively. Despite extensive methodological developments, the role of initialization in this framework has received limited attention. This study addresses this gap by systematically evaluating initialization strategies commonly used for finite hidden Markov models and assessing their suitability in the infinite setting. Results from both simulated and real datasets show that distance-based clustering initializations consistently outperform model-based and uniform alternatives, the latter being the most widely adopted in the existing literature.</p></details> |  |

However, data collection remains limited due to stringent ethical regulations, privacy concerns, and other constraints, hindering progress in the field. Synthetic data generation, particularly through Generative Adversarial Networks and Diffusion Models, has emerged as a promising solution to mitigate both data scarcity and privacy issues. However, these models are often limited to narrow operational scenarios, such as short-term and unimodal signal patterns. To address this gap, we present a systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art generative models for time series data, explicitly assessing their performance in challenging scenarios such as stress and emotion recognition. Our study examines the extent to which these models can jointly handle multi-modality, capture long-range dependencies, and support conditional generation-core requirements for real-world wearable sensor data generation. To enable a fair and rigorous comparison, we also introduce an evaluation framework that evaluates both the intrinsic fidelity of the generated data and their utility in downstream predictive tasks. Our findings reveal critical limitations in the existing approaches, particularly in maintaining cross-modal consistency, preserving temporal coherence, and ensuring robust performance in train-on-synthetic, test-on-real, and data augmentation scenarios. Finally, we present our future research directions to enhance synthetic time series generation and improve the applicability of generative models in the wearable computing domain.</p></details> |  |

| **[Wan-Move: Motion-controllable Video Generation via Latent Trajectory Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08765v1)** | 2025-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present Wan-Move, a simple and scalable framework that brings motion control to video generative models. Existing motion-controllable methods typically suffer from coarse control granularity and limited scalability, leaving their outputs insufficient for practical use. We narrow this gap by achieving precise and high-quality motion control. Our core idea is to directly make the original condition features motion-aware for guiding video synthesis. To this end, we first represent object motions with dense point trajectories, allowing fine-grained control over the scene. We then project these trajectories into latent space and propagate the first frame's features along each trajectory, producing an aligned spatiotemporal feature map that tells how each scene element should move. This feature map serves as the updated latent condition, which is naturally integrated into the off-the-shelf image-to-video model, e.g., Wan-I2V-14B, as motion guidance without any architecture change. It removes the need for auxiliary motion encoders and makes fine-tuning base models easily scalable. Through scaled training, Wan-Move generates 5-second, 480p videos whose motion controllability rivals Kling 1.5 Pro's commercial Motion Brush, as indicated by user studies. To support comprehensive evaluation, we further design MoveBench, a rigorously curated benchmark featuring diverse content categories and hybrid-verified annotations. It is distinguished by larger data volume, longer video durations, and high-quality motion annotations. Extensive experiments on MoveBench and the public dataset consistently show Wan-Move's superior motion quality. Code, models, and benchmark data are made publicly available.</p></details> | <details><summary>Neurl...</summary><p>NeurlPS 2025.

| **[Gradient-Informed Monte Carlo Fine-Tuning of Diffusion Models for Low-Thrust Trajectory Design](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08705v1)** | 2025-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Preliminary mission design of low-thrust spacecraft trajectories in the Circular Restricted Three-Body Problem is a global search characterized by a complex objective landscape and numerous local minima. Formulating the problem as sampling from an unnormalized distribution supported on neighborhoods of locally optimal solutions, provides the opportunity to deploy Markov chain Monte Carlo methods and generative machine learning. In this work, we extend our previous self-supervised diffusion model fine-tuning framework to employ gradient-informed Markov chain Monte Carlo. We compare two algorithms - the Metropolis-Adjusted Langevin Algorithm and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo - both initialized from a distribution learned by a diffusion model. Derivatives of an objective function that balances fuel consumption, time of flight and constraint violations are computed analytically using state transition matrices. We show that incorporating the gradient drift term accelerates mixing and improves convergence of the Markov chain for a multi-revolution transfer in the Saturn-Titan system. Among the evaluated methods, MALA provides the best trade-off between performance and computational cost. Starting from samples generated by a baseline diffusion model trained on a related transfer, MALA explicitly targets Pareto-optimal solutions. Compared to a random walk Metropolis algorithm, it increases the feasibility rate from 17.34% to 63.01% and produces a denser, more diverse coverage of the Pareto front. By fine-tuning a diffusion model on the generated samples and associated reward values with reward-weighted likelihood maximization, we learn the global solution structure of the problem and eliminate the need for a tedious separate data generation phase.</p></details> |  |
| **[Ergodic Trajectory Planning with Dynamic Sensor Footprints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08661v1)** | 2025-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper addresses the problem of trajectory planning for information gathering with a dynamic and resolution-varying sensor footprint. Ergodic planning offers a principled framework that balances exploration (visiting all areas) and exploitation (focusing on high-information regions) by planning trajectories such that the time spent in a region is proportional to the amount of information in that region. Existing ergodic planning often oversimplifies the sensing model by assuming a point sensor or a footprint with constant shape and resolution. In practice, the sensor footprint can drastically change over time as the robot moves, such as aerial robots equipped with downward-facing cameras, whose field of view depends on the orientation and altitude. To overcome this limitation, we propose a new metric that accounts for dynamic sensor footprints, analyze the theoretic local optimality conditions, and propose numerical trajectory optimization algorithms. Experimental results show that the proposed approach can simultaneously optimize both the trajectories and sensor footprints, with up to an order of magnitude better ergodicity than conventional methods. We also deploy our approach in a multi-drone system to ergodically cover an object in 3D space.</p></details> | 12 figures |
| **[Multi-Task Bayesian Optimization for Tuning Decentralized Trajectory Generation in Multi-UAV Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08630v1)** | 2025-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper investigates the use of Multi-Task Bayesian Optimization for tuning decentralized trajectory generation algorithms in multi-drone systems. We treat each task as a trajectory generation scenario defined by a specific number of drone-to-drone interactions. To model relationships across scenarios, we employ Multi-Task Gaussian Processes, which capture shared structure across tasks and enable efficient information transfer during optimization. We compare two strategies: optimizing the average mission time across all tasks and optimizing each task individually. Through a comprehensive simulation campaign, we show that single-task optimization leads to progressively shorter mission times as swarm size grows, but requires significantly more optimization time than the average-task approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trajectory Densification and Depth from Perspective-based Blur](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08627v1)** | 2025-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the absence of a mechanical stabilizer, the camera undergoes inevitable rotational dynamics during capturing, which induces perspective-based blur especially under long-exposure scenarios. From an optical standpoint, perspective-based blur is depth-position-dependent: objects residing at distinct spatial locations incur different blur levels even under the same imaging settings. Inspired by this, we propose a novel method that estimate metric depth by examining the blur pattern of a video stream and dense trajectory via joint optical design algorithm. Specifically, we employ off-the-shelf vision encoder and point tracker to extract video information. Then, we estimate depth map via windowed embedding and multi-window aggregation, and densify the sparse trajectory from the optical algorithm using a vision-language model. Evaluations on multiple depth datasets demonstrate that our method attains strong performance over large depth range, while maintaining favorable generalization. Relative to the real trajectory in handheld shooting settings, our optical algorithm achieves superior precision and the dense reconstruction maintains strong accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Data-Efficient Learning of Anomalous Diffusion with Wavelet Representations: Enabling Direct Learning from Experimental Trajectories](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08510v1)** | 2025-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine learning (ML) has become a versatile tool for analyzing anomalous diffusion trajectories, yet most existing pipelines are trained on large collections of simulated data. In contrast, experimental trajectories, such as those from single-particle tracking (SPT), are typically scarce and may differ substantially from the idealized models used for simulation, leading to degradation or even breakdown of performance when ML methods are applied to real data. To address this mismatch, we introduce a wavelet-based representation of anomalous diffusion that enables data-efficient learning directly from experimental recordings. This representation is constructed by applying six complementary wavelet families to each trajectory and combining the resulting wavelet modulus scalograms. We first evaluate the wavelet representation on simulated trajectories from the andi-datasets benchmark, where it clearly outperforms both feature-based and trajectory-based methods with as few as 1000 training trajectories and still retains an advantage on large training sets. We then use this representation to learn directly from experimental SPT trajectories of fluorescent beads diffusing in F-actin networks, where the wavelet representation remains superior to existing alternatives for both diffusion-exponent regression and mesh-size classification. In particular, when predicting the diffusion exponents of experimental trajectories, a model trained on 1200 experimental tracks using the wavelet representation achieves significantly lower errors than state-of-the-art deep learning models trained purely on $10^6$ simulated trajectories. We associate this data efficiency with the emergence of distinct scale fingerprints disentangling underlying diffusion mechanisms in the wavelet spectra.</p></details> | 23 pages, 16 figures |
| **[TrajMoE: Scene-Adaptive Trajectory Planning with Mixture of Experts and Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07135v2)** | 2025-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current autonomous driving systems often favor end-to-end frameworks, which take sensor inputs like images and learn to map them into trajectory space via neural networks. Previous work has demonstrated that models can achieve better planning performance when provided with a prior distribution of possible trajectories. However, these approaches often overlook two critical aspects: 1) The appropriate trajectory prior can vary significantly across different driving scenarios. 2) Their trajectory evaluation mechanism lacks policy-driven refinement, remaining constrained by the limitations of one-stage supervised training. To address these issues, we explore improvements in two key areas. For problem 1, we employ MoE to apply different trajectory priors tailored to different scenarios. For problem 2, we utilize Reinforcement Learning to fine-tune the trajectory scoring mechanism. Additionally, we integrate models with different perception backbones to enhance perceptual features. Our integrated model achieved a score of 51.08 on the navsim ICCV benchmark, securing third place.</p></details> |  |
| **[CDKFormer: Contextual Deviation Knowledge-Based Transformer for Long-Tail Trajectory Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12695v2)** | 2025-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predicting the future movements of surrounding vehicles is essential for ensuring the safe operation and efficient navigation of autonomous vehicles (AVs) in urban traffic environments. Existing vehicle trajectory prediction methods primarily focus on improving overall performance, yet they struggle to address long-tail scenarios effectively. This limitation often leads to poor predictions in rare cases, significantly increasing the risk of safety incidents. Taking Argoverse 2 motion forecasting dataset as an example, we first investigate the long-tail characteristics in trajectory samples from two perspectives, individual motion and group interaction, and deriving deviation features to distinguish abnormal from regular scenarios. On this basis, we propose CDKFormer, a Contextual Deviation Knowledge-based Transformer model for long-tail trajectory prediction. CDKFormer integrates an attention-based scene context fusion module to encode spatiotemporal interaction and road topology. An additional deviation feature fusion module is proposed to capture the dynamic deviations in the target vehicle status. We further introduce a dual query-based decoder, supported by a multi-stream decoder block, to sequentially decode heterogeneous scene deviation features and generate multimodal trajectory predictions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CDKFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly enhancing prediction accuracy and robustness for long-tailed trajectories compared to existing methods, thus advancing the reliability of AVs in complex real-world environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Zo3T: Zero-Shot 3D-Aware Trajectory-Guided Image-to-Video Generation via Test-Time Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06723v3)** | 2025-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory-Guided image-to-video (I2V) generation aims to synthesize videos that adhere to user-specified motion instructions. Existing methods typically rely on computationally expensive fine-tuning on scarce annotated datasets. Although some zero-shot methods attempt to trajectory control in the latent space, they may yield unrealistic motion by neglecting 3D perspective and creating a misalignment between the manipulated latents and the network's noise predictions. To address these challenges, we introduce Zo3T, a novel zero-shot test-time-training framework for trajectory-guided generation with three core innovations: First, we incorporate a 3D-Aware Kinematic Projection, leveraging inferring scene depth to derive perspective-correct affine transformations for target regions. Second, we introduce Trajectory-Guided Test-Time LoRA, a mechanism that dynamically injects and optimizes ephemeral LoRA adapters into the denoising network alongside the latent state. Driven by a regional feature consistency loss, this co-adaptation effectively enforces motion constraints while allowing the pre-trained model to locally adapt its internal representations to the manipulated latent, thereby ensuring generative fidelity and on-manifold adherence. Finally, we develop Guidance Field Rectification, which refines the denoising evolutionary path by optimizing the conditional guidance field through a one-step lookahead strategy, ensuring efficient generative progression towards the target trajectory. Zo3T significantly enhances 3D realism and motion accuracy in trajectory-controlled I2V generation, demonstrating superior performance over existing training-based and zero-shot approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[CLARITY: Medical World Model for Guiding Treatment Decisions by Modeling Context-Aware Disease Trajectories in Latent Space](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08029v1)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Clinical decision-making in oncology requires predicting dynamic disease evolution, a task current static AI predictors cannot perform. While world models (WMs) offer a paradigm for generative prediction, existing medical applications remain limited. Existing methods often rely on stochastic diffusion models, focusing on visual reconstruction rather than causal, physiological transitions. Furthermore, in medical domain, models like MeWM typically ignore patient-specific temporal and clinical contexts and lack a feedback mechanism to link predictions to treatment decisions. To address these gaps, we introduce CLARITY, a medical world model that forecasts disease evolution directly within a structured latent space. It explicitly integrates time intervals (temporal context) and patient-specific data (clinical context) to model treatment-conditioned progression as a smooth, interpretable trajectory, and thus generate physiologically faithful, individualized treatment plans. Finally, CLARITY introduces a novel prediction-to-decision framework, translating latent rollouts into transparent, actionable recommendations. CLARITY demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in treatment planning. On the MU-Glioma-Post dataset, our approach outperforms recent MeWM by 12\%, and significantly surpasses all other medical-specific large language models.</p></details> |  |
| **[T1-PILOT: Optimized Trajectories for T1 Mapping Acceleration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20333v2)** | 2025-12-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cardiac T1 mapping provides critical quantitative insights into myocardial tissue composition, enabling the assessment of pathologies such as fibrosis, inflammation, and edema. However, the inherently dynamic nature of the heart imposes strict limits on acquisition times, making high-resolution T1 mapping a persistent challenge. Compressed sensing (CS) approaches have reduced scan durations by undersampling k-space and reconstructing images from partial data, and recent studies show that jointly optimizing the undersampling patterns with the reconstruction network can substantially improve performance. Still, most current T1 mapping pipelines rely on static, hand-crafted masks that do not exploit the full acceleration and accuracy potential. In this work, we introduce T1-PILOT: an end-to-end method that explicitly incorporates the T1 signal relaxation model into the sampling-reconstruction framework to guide the learning of non-Cartesian trajectories, crossframe alignment, and T1 decay estimation. Through extensive experiments on the CMRxRecon dataset, T1-PILOT significantly outperforms several baseline strategies (including learned single-mask and fixed radial or golden-angle sampling schemes), achieving higher T1 map fidelity at greater acceleration factors. In particular, we observe consistent gains in PSNR and VIF relative to existing methods, along with marked improvements in delineating finer myocardial structures. Our results highlight that optimizing sampling trajectories in tandem with the physical relaxation model leads to both enhanced quantitative accuracy and reduced acquisition times.</p></details> |  |
| **[Know your Trajectory -- Trustworthy Reinforcement Learning deployment through Importance-Based Trajectory Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06917v1)** | 2025-12-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents are increasingly deployed in real-world applications, ensuring their behavior is transparent and trustworthy is paramount. A key component of trust is explainability, yet much of the work in Explainable RL (XRL) focuses on local, single-step decisions. This paper addresses the critical need for explaining an agent's long-term behavior through trajectory-level analysis. We introduce a novel framework that ranks entire trajectories by defining and aggregating a new state-importance metric. This metric combines the classic Q-value difference with a "radical term" that captures the agent's affinity to reach its goal, providing a more nuanced measure of state criticality. We demonstrate that our method successfully identifies optimal trajectories from a heterogeneous collection of agent experiences. Furthermore, by generating counterfactual rollouts from critical states within these trajectories, we show that the agent's chosen path is robustly superior to alternatives, thereby providing a powerful "Why this, and not that?" explanation. Our experiments in standard OpenAI Gym environments validate that our proposed importance metric is more effective at identifying optimal behaviors compared to classic approaches, offering a significant step towards trustworthy autonomous systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at 4th Deployable AI Workshop at AAAI 2026</p></details> |
| **[A New Trajectory-Oriented Approach to Enhancing Comprehensive Crowd Navigation Performance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06608v1)** | 2025-12-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Crowd navigation has garnered considerable research interest in recent years, especially with the proliferating application of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) techniques. Many studies, however, do not sufficiently analyze the relative priorities among evaluation metrics, which compromises the fair assessment of methods with divergent objectives. Furthermore, trajectory-continuity metrics, specifically those requiring $C^2$ smoothness, are rarely incorporated. Current DRL approaches generally prioritize efficiency and proximal comfort, often neglecting trajectory optimization or addressing it only through simplistic, unvalidated smoothness reward. Nevertheless, effective trajectory optimization is essential to ensure naturalness, enhance comfort, and maximize the energy efficiency of any navigation system. To address these gaps, this paper proposes a unified framework that enables the fair and transparent assessment of navigation methods by examining the prioritization and joint evaluation of multiple optimization objectives. We further propose a novel reward-shaping strategy that explicitly emphasizes trajectory-curvature optimization. The resulting trajectory quality and adaptability are significantly enhanced across multi-scale scenarios. Through extensive 2D and 3D experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> | 8 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Trajectory Optimization for Cellular-Connected UAV in Complex Environment with Partial CKM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06452v1)** | 2025-12-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cellular-connected unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are expected to play an increasingly important role in future wireless networks. To facilitate the reliable navigation for cellular-connected UAVs, channel knowledge map (CKM) is considered a promising approach capable of tackling the non-negligible co-channel interference resulting from the high line-of-sight (LoS) probability of air-ground (AG) channels. Nevertheless, due to measurement constraints and the aging of information, CKM is usually incomplete and needs to be regularly updated to capture the dynamic nature of complex environments. In this paper, we propose a novel trajectory design strategy in which UAV navigation and CKM completion are incorporated into a common framework, enabling mutual benefits for both tasks. Specifically, a cellular-connected UAV deployed in an urban environment measures the radio information during its flight and completes the CKM with Kriging interpolation. Based on the method of grid discretization and spherical approximation, a mixed-integer multi-objective optimization problem is formulated. The problem falls into the category of combinatorial mathematics and is essentially equivalent to determining an optimum sequence of grid points to traverse. Through proper mathematical manipulation, the problem is reformulated as variants of two classic models in graph theory, namely the shortest-path problem (SPP) and the traveling salesman problem (TSP). Two navigation strategies based on the two different models are proposed and thoroughly compared based on numerical results to provide implementable methods for engineering practice and reveal the trade-offs between UAV navigation and CKM completion. Simulation results reveal that the proposed navigation strategies can quickly expand the Pareto boundary of the problem and approach the performance of fully-known CKM.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-Modal Zero-Shot Prediction of Color Trajectories in Food Drying](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06190v1)** | 2025-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Food drying is widely used to reduce moisture content, ensure safety, and extend shelf life. Color evolution of food samples is an important indicator of product quality in food drying. Although existing studies have examined color changes under different drying conditions, current approaches primarily rely on low-dimensional color features and cannot fully capture the complex, dynamic color trajectories of food samples. Moreover, existing modeling approaches lack the ability to generalize to unseen process conditions. To address these limitations, we develop a novel multi-modal color-trajectory prediction method that integrates high-dimensional temporal color information with drying process parameters to enable accurate and data-efficient color trajectory prediction. Under unseen drying conditions, the model attains RMSEs of 2.12 for cookie drying and 1.29 for apple drying, reducing errors by over 90% compared with baseline models. These experimental results demonstrate the model's superior accuracy, robustness, and broad applicability.</p></details> |  |
| **[iMotion-LLM: Instruction-Conditioned Trajectory Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06211v3)** | 2025-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce iMotion-LLM, a large language model (LLM) integrated with trajectory prediction modules for interactive motion generation. Unlike conventional approaches, it generates feasible, safety-aligned trajectories based on textual instructions, enabling adaptable and context-aware driving behavior. It combines an encoder-decoder multimodal trajectory prediction model with a pre-trained LLM fine-tuned using LoRA, projecting scene features into the LLM input space and mapping special tokens to a trajectory decoder for text-based interaction and interpretable driving. To support this framework, we introduce two datasets: 1) InstructWaymo, an extension of the Waymo Open Motion Dataset with direction-based motion instructions, and 2) Open-Vocabulary InstructNuPlan, which features safety-aligned instruction-caption pairs and corresponding safe trajectory scenarios. Our experiments validate that instruction conditioning enables trajectory generation that follows the intended condition. iMotion-LLM demonstrates strong contextual comprehension, achieving 84% average accuracy in direction feasibility detection and 96% average accuracy in safety evaluation of open-vocabulary instructions. This work lays the foundation for text-guided motion generation in autonomous driving, supporting simulated data generation, model interpretability, and robust safety alignment testing for trajectory generation models. Our code, pre-trained model, and datasets are available at: https://vision-cair.github.io/iMotion-LLM/.</p></details> |  |

Leveraging Bayesian Active Inference, the approach combines expert-generated demonstrations with probabilistic generative modeling to encode high-level symbolic planning, low-level motion policies, and wireless signal feedback. During deployment, the UAV performs online inference to anticipate interference, localize jammers, and adapt its trajectory accordingly, without prior knowledge of jammer locations. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves near-expert performance, significantly reducing communication interference and mission cost compared to model-free reinforcement learning baselines, while maintaining robust generalization in dynamic environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted for the 2026 IEEE Consumer Communications & Networking Conference (IEEE CCNC 2026)</p></details> |
| **[Scenario-aware Uncertainty Quantification for Trajectory Prediction with Statistical Guarantees](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05682v1)** | 2025-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reliable uncertainty quantification in trajectory prediction is crucial for safety-critical autonomous driving systems, yet existing deep learning predictors lack uncertainty-aware frameworks adaptable to heterogeneous real-world scenarios. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel scenario-aware uncertainty quantification framework to provide the predicted trajectories with prediction intervals and reliability assessment. To begin with, predicted trajectories from the trained predictor and their ground truth are projected onto the map-derived reference routes within the Frenet coordinate system. We then employ CopulaCPTS as the conformal calibration method to generate temporal prediction intervals for distinct scenarios as the uncertainty measure. Building upon this, within the proposed trajectory reliability discriminator (TRD), mean error and calibrated confidence intervals are synergistically analyzed to establish reliability models for different scenarios. Subsequently, the risk-aware discriminator leverages a joint risk model that integrates longitudinal and lateral prediction intervals within the Frenet coordinate to identify critical points. This enables segmentation of trajectories into reliable and unreliable segments, holding the advantage of informing downstream planning modules with actionable reliability results. We evaluated our framework using the real-world nuPlan dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness in scenario-aware uncertainty quantification and reliability assessment across diverse driving contexts.</p></details> |  |
| **[Momentum-constrained Hybrid Heuristic Trajectory Optimization Framework with Residual-enhanced DRL for Visually Impaired Scenarios](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15582v2)** | 2025-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper proposes a momentum-constrained hybrid heuristic trajectory optimization framework (MHHTOF) tailored for assistive navigation in visually impaired scenarios, integrating trajectory sampling generation, optimization and evaluation with residual-enhanced deep reinforcement learning (DRL). In the first stage, heuristic trajectory sampling cluster (HTSC) is generated in the Frenet coordinate system using third-order interpolation with fifth-order polynomials and momentum-constrained trajectory optimization (MTO) constraints to ensure smoothness and feasibility. After first stage cost evaluation, the second stage leverages a residual-enhanced actor-critic network with LSTM-based temporal feature modeling to adaptively refine trajectory selection in the Cartesian coordinate system. A dual-stage cost modeling mechanism (DCMM) with weight transfer aligns semantic priorities across stages, supporting human-centered optimization. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed LSTM-ResB-PPO achieves significantly faster convergence, attaining stable policy performance in approximately half the training iterations required by the PPO baseline, while simultaneously enhancing both reward outcomes and training stability. Compared to baseline method, the selected model reduces average cost and cost variance by 30.3% and 53.3%, and lowers ego and obstacle risks by over 77%. These findings validate the framework's effectiveness in enhancing robustness, safety, and real-time feasibility in complex assistive planning tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Upon ...</summary><p>Upon further internal evaluation, we found that the current version does not adequately represent the clarity and completeness that we intend for this work.

Existing soft-constraint methods achieve faster computation, but either (1) decouple spatial and temporal optimization or (2) restrict the search space. To overcome these limitations, we introduce MIGHTY, a Hermite spline-based planner that performs spatiotemporal optimization while fully leveraging the continuous search space of a spline. In simulation, MIGHTY achieves a 9.3% reduction in computation time and a 13.1% reduction in travel time over state-of-the-art baselines, with a 100% success rate. In hardware, MIGHTY completes multiple high-speed flights up to 6.7 m/s in a cluttered static environment and long-duration flights with dynamically added obstacles.</p></details> | 9 pages, 10 figures |
| **[On Disturbance-Aware Minimum-Time Trajectory Planning: Evidence from Tests on a Dynamic Driving Simulator](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04917v1)** | 2025-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work investigates how disturbance-aware, robustness-embedded reference trajectories translate into driving performance when executed by professional drivers in a dynamic simulator. Three planned reference trajectories are compared against a free-driving baseline (NOREF) to assess trade-offs between lap time (LT) and steering effort (SE): NOM, the nominal time-optimal trajectory; TLC, a track-limit-robust trajectory obtained by tightening margins to the track edges; and FLC, a friction-limit-robust trajectory obtained by tightening against axle and tire saturation. All trajectories share the same minimum lap-time objective with a small steering-smoothness regularizer and are evaluated by two professional drivers using a high-performance car on a virtual track. The trajectories derive from a disturbance-aware minimum-lap-time framework recently proposed by the authors, where worst-case disturbance growth is propagated over a finite horizon and used to tighten tire-friction and track-limit constraints, preserving performance while providing probabilistic safety margins. LT and SE are used as performance indicators, while RMS lateral deviation, speed error, and drift angle characterize driving style. Results show a Pareto-like LT-SE trade-off: NOM yields the shortest LT but highest SE; TLC minimizes SE at the cost of longer LT; FLC lies near the efficient frontier, substantially reducing SE relative to NOM with only a small LT increase. Removing trajectory guidance (NOREF) increases both LT and SE, confirming that reference trajectories improve pace and control efficiency. Overall, the findings highlight reference-based and disturbance-aware planning, especially FLC, as effective tools for training and for achieving fast yet stable trajectories.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 11 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

However, a major challenge in developing generalized GUI agents is the lack of sufficient trajectory data across various operating systems and applications, mainly due to the high cost of manual annotations. In this paper, we propose the TongUI framework that builds generalized GUI agents by learning from rich multimodal web tutorials. Concretely, we crawl and process online GUI tutorials (such as videos and articles) into GUI agent trajectory data, through which we produce the GUI-Net dataset containing 143K trajectory data across five operating systems and more than 200 applications. We develop the TongUI agent by fine-tuning Qwen2.5-VL-3B/7B models on GUI-Net, which show remarkable performance improvements on commonly used grounding and navigation benchmarks, outperforming baseline agents about 10\% on multiple benchmarks, showing the effectiveness of the GUI-Net dataset and underscoring the significance of our TongUI framework. We will fully open-source the code, the GUI-Net dataset, and the trained models soon.</p></details> | AAAI 2026 |

Using twenty years of longitudinal administrative records from a Faculty of Engineering and Exact Sciences, this study tests whether the CBC actually operates as a uniform gateway or as a differential filter across majors. We reconstruct student trajectories for 24,017 entrants, identifying CBC subjects (year level <= 1), destination major, time to exit from the CBC, and final outcome (progression to upper cycle, drop-out, or right-censoring). The analysis combines transition matrices, Kaplan-Meier survival curves, stratified Cox models and subject-level logistic models of drop-out after failure, extended with multi-major enrolment data and a pre/post 2006 curriculum reform comparison. Results show that the CBC functions as a strongly differential filter. Post-reform, the probability of progressing to the upper cycle in the same major ranges from about 0.20 to 0.70 across programmes, while overall drop-out in the CBC exceeds 60%. Early Mathematics modules (introductory calculus and algebra) emerge as structural bottlenecks, combining low pass rates with a two- to three-fold increase in the hazard of leaving the system after failure, with markedly different severity by destination major. Multi-major enrolment, often treated administratively as indecision, is instead associated with lower drop-out, suggesting an adaptive exploration of feasible trajectories. The findings portray the CBC not as a neutral academic foyer, but as a structured sorting device whose impact depends sharply on the targeted degree and on the opportunity to explore alternative majors.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 5 figures , 3 tables</p></details> |

The approach starts with partial feedback linearization and stabilization. Then, transverse linearization along the reference orbit is computed, resulting in a periodic linear time-varying system with a stable subspace. Sliding-mode control drives trajectories toward this subspace. The proposed design avoids solving computationally intensive periodic LQR problems and improves robustness to matched disturbances. The methodology is validated through experiments on the Butterfly robot.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trajectory Balance with Asynchrony: Decoupling Exploration and Learning for Fast, Scalable LLM Post-Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18929v2)** | 2025-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) is a critical component of large language model (LLM) post-training. However, on-policy algorithms used for post-training are not naturally robust to a diversified content of experience replay buffers, which asynchronous off-policy actors can efficiently populate in parallel to training. We propose efficiently learning on such off-policy data via Trajectory Balance with Asynchrony (TBA), an approach to asynchronous RL for LLMs that leverages the principled off-policy TB objective. On math, preference-tuning, and automated red-teaming tasks, we post-train models ranging from Pythia 410M to Qwen 2.5 7B, finding TBA offers speed and performance boosts over strong baselines like Online DPO and Dr. GRPO. Beyond TBA's performance benefits (high accuracy even as asynchrony grows) and speedups ($4\times$ or more), we show its reward- and recency-prioritizing sampling enable further gains as data generation is scaled. Our code is available at https://github.com/bbartoldson/TBA.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025; 27 pages</p></details> |
| **[Origin-Conditional Trajectory Encoding: Measuring Urban Configurational Asymmetries through Neural Decomposition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03755v1)** | 2025-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Urban analytics increasingly relies on AI-driven trajectory analysis, yet current approaches suffer from methodological fragmentation: trajectory learning captures movement patterns but ignores spatial context, while spatial embedding methods encode street networks but miss temporal dynamics. Three gaps persist: (1) lack of joint training that integrates spatial and temporal representations, (2) origin-agnostic treatment that ignores directional asymmetries in navigation ($A \to B \ne B \to A$), and (3) over-reliance on auxiliary data (POIs, imagery) rather than fundamental geometric properties of urban space. We introduce a conditional trajectory encoder that jointly learns spatial and movement representations while preserving origin-dependent asymmetries using geometric features. This framework decomposes urban navigation into shared cognitive patterns and origin-specific spatial narratives, enabling quantitative measurement of cognitive asymmetries across starting locations. Our bidirectional LSTM processes visibility ratio and curvature features conditioned on learnable origin embeddings, decomposing representations into shared urban patterns and origin-specific signatures through contrastive learning. Results from six synthetic cities and real-world validation on Beijing's Xicheng District demonstrate that urban morphology creates systematic cognitive inequalities. This provides urban planners quantitative tools for assessing experiential equity, offers architects insights into layout decisions' cognitive impacts, and enables origin-aware analytics for navigation systems.</p></details> |  |

While repair-based methods fail to restore complex artifacts and LiDAR-based approaches rely on sparse and incomplete cues, ReCamDriving leverages dense and scene-complete 3DGS renderings for explicit geometric guidance, achieving precise camera-controllable generation. To mitigate overfitting to restoration behaviors when conditioned on 3DGS renderings, ReCamDriving adopts a two-stage training paradigm: the first stage uses camera poses for coarse control, while the second stage incorporates 3DGS renderings for fine-grained viewpoint and geometric guidance. Furthermore, we present a 3DGS-based cross-trajectory data curation strategy to eliminate the train-test gap in camera transformation patterns, enabling scalable multi-trajectory supervision from monocular videos. Based on this strategy, we construct the ParaDrive dataset, containing over 110K parallel-trajectory video pairs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ReCamDriving achieves state-of-the-art camera controllability and structural consistency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://recamdriving.github.io/</p></details> |

While task-space planning and control have been extensively studied for larger, arm-scale manipulators, demonstrations of precise task-space trajectory tracking in compact, multi-DoF robotic fingers remain scarce. In this paper, we present the physical prototyping and experimental characterization of a three-degree-of-freedom, linkage-driven, series-parallel robotic finger with analytic forward kinematics and a closed-form Jacobian. A resolved motion rate control (RMRC) scheme is implemented to achieve closed-loop task-space trajectory tracking. We experimentally evaluate the fingertip tracking performance across a variety of trajectories, including straight lines, circles, and more complex curves, and report millimeter-level accuracy. To the best of our knowledge, this work provides one of the first systematic experimental demonstrations of precise task-space trajectory tracking in a linkage-driven robotic finger, thereby establishing a benchmark for future designs aimed at dexterous in-hand manipulation.</p></details> |  |

It contains over 440,000 facial trajectories in total, among which more than 52,000 are longer than 10 frames, including 68 manually reviewed trajectories that span the entire 150 frames. To the best of our knowledge, PoreTrack3D is the first benchmark dataset to capture both traditional facial landmarks and pore-scale keypoints trajectory, advancing the study of fine-grained facial expressions through the analysis of subtle skin-surface motion. We systematically evaluate state-of-the-art dynamic 3D Gaussian splatting methods on PoreTrack3D, establishing the first performance baseline in this domain. Overall, the pipeline developed for this benchmark dataset's creation establishes a new framework for high-fidelity facial motion capture and dynamic 3D reconstruction.

| **[TGDD: Trajectory Guided Dataset Distillation with Balanced Distribution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02469v1)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dataset distillation compresses large datasets into compact synthetic ones to reduce storage and computational costs. Among various approaches, distribution matching (DM)-based methods have attracted attention for their high efficiency. However, they often overlook the evolution of feature representations during training, which limits the expressiveness of synthetic data and weakens downstream performance. To address this issue, we propose Trajectory Guided Dataset Distillation (TGDD), which reformulates distribution matching as a dynamic alignment process along the model's training trajectory. At each training stage, TGDD captures evolving semantics by aligning the feature distribution between the synthetic and original dataset. Meanwhile, it introduces a distribution constraint regularization to reduce class overlap. This design helps synthetic data preserve both semantic diversity and representativeness, improving performance in downstream tasks. Without additional optimization overhead, TGDD achieves a favorable balance between performance and efficiency. Experiments on ten datasets demonstrate that TGDD achieves state-of-the-art performance, notably a 5.0% accuracy gain on high-resolution benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in AAAI 2026</p></details> |

Existing methods often struggle to efficiently extract valuable scene information from redundant data, thereby reducing computational efficiency and prediction accuracy, especially when dealing with intricate agent interactions. To address these challenges, we propose a novel map-free trajectory prediction algorithm that achieves trajectory prediction across the temporal, spatial, and frequency domains. Specifically, in temporal information processing, We utilize a Mixture of Experts (MoE) mechanism to adaptively select critical frequency components. Concurrently, we extract these components and integrate multi-scale temporal features. Subsequently, a selective attention module is proposed to filter out redundant information in both temporal sequences and spatial interactions. Finally, we design a multimodal decoder. Under the supervision of patch-level and point-level losses, we obtain reasonable trajectory results. Experiments on Nuscences datasets demonstrate the superiority of our algorithm, validating its effectiveness in handling complex interactive scenarios.</p></details> |  |

However, threats to MOT algorithms have yet been widely studied. In particular, incorrect association between the tracked objects and their assigned IDs can lead to severe consequences, such as wrong trajectory predictions. Previous attacks against MOT either focused on hijacking the trackers of individual objects, or manipulating the tracker IDs in MOT by attacking the integrated object detection (OD) module in the digital domain, which are model-specific, non-robust, and only able to affect specific samples in offline datasets. In this paper, we present AdvTraj, the first online and physical ID-manipulation attack against tracking-by-detection MOT, in which an attacker uses adversarial trajectories to transfer its ID to a targeted object to confuse the tracking system, without attacking OD. Our simulation results in CARLA show that AdvTraj can fool ID assignments with 100% success rate in various scenarios for white-box attacks against SORT, which also have high attack transferability (up to 93% attack success rate) against state-of-the-art (SOTA) MOT algorithms due to their common design principles. We characterize the patterns of trajectories generated by AdvTraj and propose two universal adversarial maneuvers that can be performed by a human walker/driver in daily scenarios. Our work reveals under-explored weaknesses in the object association phase of SOTA MOT systems, and provides insights into enhancing the robustness of such systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to Annual Computer Security Applications Conference (ACSAC) 2024</p></details> |

However, its effectiveness is often limited by two critical challenges: the reliance on extensive human input and the inherent difficulties in resolving query ambiguity and credit assignment during reward learning. In this paper, we introduce PRIMT, a PbRL framework designed to overcome these challenges by leveraging foundation models (FMs) for multimodal synthetic feedback and trajectory synthesis. Unlike prior approaches that rely on single-modality FM evaluations, PRIMT employs a hierarchical neuro-symbolic fusion strategy, integrating the complementary strengths of large language models and vision-language models in evaluating robot behaviors for more reliable and comprehensive feedback. PRIMT also incorporates foresight trajectory generation, which reduces early-stage query ambiguity by warm-starting the trajectory buffer with bootstrapped samples, and hindsight trajectory augmentation, which enables counterfactual reasoning with a causal auxiliary loss to improve credit assignment. We evaluate PRIMT on 2 locomotion and 6 manipulation tasks on various benchmarks, demonstrating superior performance over FM-based and scripted baselines.</p></details> |  |

While keeping the human in the loop remains essential, for instance, to ensure high precision, partial automation of certain task phases is critical for productivity. We present a unified framework for probabilistic VFs that seamlessly switches between manual fixtures, semi-automated fixtures (with the human handling precise tasks), and full autonomy. We introduce a novel probabilistic Dynamical System-based VF for coarse guidance, enabling the robot to autonomously complete certain task phases while keeping the human operator in the loop. For tasks requiring precise guidance, we extend probabilistic position-based trajectory fixtures with automation allowing for seamless human interaction as well as geometry-awareness and optimal impedance gains. For manual tasks requiring very precise guidance, we also extend visual servoing fixtures with the same geometry-awareness and impedance behavior. We validate our approach experimentally on different robots, showcasing multiple operation modes and the ease of programming fixtures.</p></details> | <details><summary>for t...</summary><p>for the supplementary video, see https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUXzcpMbMnY</p></details> |
| **[Capturing Context-Aware Route Choice Semantics for Trajectory Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14819v2)** | 2025-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory representation learning (TRL) aims to encode raw trajectory data into low-dimensional embeddings for downstream tasks such as travel time estimation, mobility prediction, and trajectory similarity analysis. From a behavioral perspective, a trajectory reflects a sequence of route choices within an urban environment. However, most existing TRL methods ignore this underlying decision-making process and instead treat trajectories as static, passive spatiotemporal sequences, thereby limiting the semantic richness of the learned representations. To bridge this gap, we propose CORE, a TRL framework that integrates context-aware route choice semantics into trajectory embeddings. CORE first incorporates a multi-granular Environment Perception Module, which leverages large language models (LLMs) to distill environmental semantics from point of interest (POI) distributions, thereby constructing a context-enriched road network. Building upon this backbone, CORE employs a Route Choice Encoder with a mixture-of-experts (MoE) architecture, which captures route choice patterns by jointly leveraging the context-enriched road network and navigational factors. Finally, a Transformer encoder aggregates the route-choice-aware representations into a global trajectory embedding. Extensive experiments on 4 real-world datasets across 6 downstream tasks demonstrate that CORE consistently outperforms 12 state-of-the-art TRL methods, achieving an average improvement of 9.79% over the best-performing baseline. Our code is available at https://github.com/caoji2001/CORE.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improving Partially Observed Trajectories Forecasting by Target-driven Self-Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16767v2)** | 2025-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate prediction of future trajectories of traffic agents is essential for ensuring safe autonomous driving. However, partially observed trajectories can significantly degrade the performance of even state-of-the-art models. Previous approaches often rely on knowledge distillation to transfer features from fully observed trajectories to partially observed ones. This involves firstly training a fully observed model and then using a distillation process to create the final model. While effective, they require multi-stage training, making the training process very expensive. Moreover, knowledge distillation can lead to a performance degradation of the model. In this paper, we introduce a Target-drivenSelf-Distillation method (TSD) for motion forecasting. Our method leverages predicted accurate targets to guide the model in making predictions under partial observation conditions. By employing self-distillation, the model learns from the feature distributions of both fully observed and partially observed trajectories during a single end-to-end training process. This enhances the model's ability to predict motion accurately in both fully observed and partially observed scenarios. We evaluate our method on multiple datasets and state-of-the-art motion forecasting models. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves significant performance improvements in both settings. To facilitate further research, we will release our code and model checkpoints.</p></details> |  |

Each MDT defines a trajectory-dependent diffusion operator with a clear probabilistic and geometric interpretation, capturing over time the interplay between data views. Our formulation encompasses existing multi-view diffusion models, while providing new degrees of freedom for view interaction and fusion. We establish theoretical properties under mild assumptions, including ergodicity of both the point-wise operator and the process in itself. We also derive MDT-based diffusion distances, and associated embeddings via singular value decompositions. Finally, we propose various strategies for learning MDT operators within the defined operator space, guided by internal quality measures. Beyond enabling flexible model design, MDTs also offer a neutral baseline for evaluating diffusion-based approaches through comparison with randomly selected MDTs. Experiments show the practical impact of the MDT operators in a manifold learning and data clustering context.</p></details> |  |

Conventional communication schemes often incur significant transmission overhead and latency, while existing trajectory prediction models generally lack environmental perception and logical inference capabilities. This paper presents a trajectory prediction framework that integrates semantic communication with Agentic AI to enhance predictive performance in vehicular environments. In vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication, a feature-extraction agent at the Roadside Unit (RSU) derives compact representations from historical vehicle trajectories, followed by semantic reasoning performed by a semantic-analysis agent. The RSU then transmits both feature representations and semantic insights to the target vehicle via semantic communication, enabling the vehicle to predict future trajectories by combining received semantics with its own historical data. In vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication, each vehicle performs local feature extraction and semantic analysis while receiving predicted trajectories from neighboring vehicles, and jointly utilizes this information for its own trajectory prediction. Extensive experiments across diverse communication conditions demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms baseline schemes, achieving up to a 47.5% improvement in prediction accuracy under low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted for possible journal publication</p></details> |

(1) \textit{Shared credit assignment}: trajectory-level advantages derived from group-normalized sparse terminal rewards are uniformly applied across timesteps, failing to accurately estimate the potential of early denoising steps with vast exploration spaces. (2) \textit{Reward-mixing}: predefined weights for combining multi-objective rewards (e.g., text accuracy, visual quality, text color)--which have mismatched scales and variances--lead to unstable gradients and conflicting updates. To address these issues, we propose \textbf{Multi-GRPO}, a multi-group advantage estimation framework with two orthogonal grouping mechanisms. For better credit assignment, we introduce tree-based trajectories inspired by Monte Carlo Tree Search: branching trajectories at selected early denoising steps naturally forms \emph{temporal groups}, enabling accurate advantage estimation for early steps via descendant leaves while amortizing computation through shared prefixes. For multi-objective optimization, we introduce \emph{reward-based grouping} to compute advantages for each reward function \textit{independently} before aggregation, disentangling conflicting signals. To facilitate evaluation of multiple objective alignment, we curate \textit{OCR-Color-10}, a visual text rendering dataset with explicit color constraints. Across the single-reward \textit{PickScore-25k} and multi-objective \textit{OCR-Color-10} benchmarks, Multi-GRPO achieves superior stability and alignment performance, effectively balancing conflicting objectives.

We argue that multimodal large language models (MLLMs), despite extensive video training, lack this fundamental spatial reasoning capability, a critical limitation for embodied applications. To demonstrate these limitations and drive research, we introduce REM (Reasoning over Embodied Multi-Frame Trajectories), a benchmark using controllable 3D environments for long-horizon embodied spatial reasoning. REM systematically evaluates key aspects like object permanence/distinction, spatial relationships, and numerical tracking across dynamic embodied viewpoints. Our evaluation shows that the best-performing current models exhibit promising overall performance, but become increasingly unreliable at even moderate complexity levels easily handled by humans. These findings highlight challenges MLLMs face in developing robust spatial representations from sequential visual input. Consequently, REM provides targeted metrics and diagnostics to foster improved spatial understanding in future models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Further Exploration of the Effects of Time-varying Covariate in Growth Mixture Models with Nonlinear Trajectories](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.06014v3)** | 2025-11-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Growth mixture modeling (GMM) is an analytical tool for identifying multiple unobserved sub-populations of longitudinal processes. In particular, it describes change patterns within each latent sub-population and examines between-individual differences in within-individual change for each sub-group. One research interest in utilizing GMMs is to explore how covariates affect such heterogeneity in change patterns. Liu and Perera (2022c) extended mixture-of-experts (MoE) models, which mainly focus on time-invariant covariates, for allowing the covariates to account for within-group and between-group differences simultaneously and examining the heterogeneity in nonlinear trajectories. The present study further extends Liu and Perera (2022c) and examines the effects on trajectory heterogeneity of time-varying covariates (TVCs). Specifically, we propose methods to decompose a TVC into a trait feature (e.g., the baseline value of the TVC) and a set of state features (e.g., interval-specific slopes or changes). The trait features are allowed to account for within-group differences in growth factors of trajectories (i.e., trait effect), and the state features are allowed to impact observed values of a longitudinal process (i.e., state effect). We examine the proposed models using a simulation study and a real-world data analysis. The simulation study demonstrated that the proposed models are capable of separating trajectories into several clusters and generally generating unbiased and accurate estimates with target coverage probabilities. With the proposed models, we showed the heterogeneity in the trait and state features of reading ability across latent classes of students' mathematics performance. Meanwhile, the trait and state effects on mathematics development of reading ability are also heterogeneous across the clusters of students.</p></details> | <details><summary>\text...</summary><p>\textcircled{c}2024, Behavior Research Methods.

If the process under investigation is tracked for a long time, its trajectory may show a certain degree of nonlinearity, so that the rate-of-change is not constant. A fundamental goal of modeling such nonlinear processes is to estimate model parameters that reflect meaningful aspects of change, including the parameters related to change and other parameters that shed light on substantive hypotheses. However, if the measurement occasion is unstructured, existing models cannot simultaneously estimate these two types of parameters. This article has three goals. First, we view the change over time as the area under the curve (AUC) of the rate-of-change versus time (r-t) graph. Second, using the instantaneous rate-of-change midway through a time interval to approximate the average rate-of-change during that interval, we propose a new specification to describe longitudinal processes. In addition to obtaining the individual change-related parameters and other parameters related to specific research questions, the new specification allows for unequally-space study waves and individual measurement occasions around each wave. Third, we derive the model-based interval-specific change and change-from-baseline, two common measures to evaluate change over time. We evaluate the proposed specification through a simulation study and a real-world data analysis. We also provide OpenMx and Mplus 8 code for each model with the novel specification.</p></details> | <details><summary>\text...</summary><p>\textcircled{c}2023, Behavior Research Methods.

However, datasets containing suboptimal and fragmented trajectories present challenges for reward propagation, resulting in inaccurate value estimation and degraded policy performance. While trajectory stitching via generative models offers a promising solution, existing augmentation methods frequently produce trajectories that are either confined to the support of the behavior policy or violate the underlying dynamics, thereby limiting their effectiveness for policy improvement. We propose ASTRO, a data augmentation framework that generates distributionally novel and dynamics-consistent trajectories for offline RL. ASTRO first learns a temporal-distance representation to identify distinct and reachable stitch targets. We then employ a dynamics-guided stitch planner that adaptively generates connecting action sequences via Rollout Deviation Feedback, defined as the gap between target state sequence and the actual arrived state sequence by executing predicted actions, to improve trajectory stitching's feasibility and reachability. This approach facilitates effective augmentation through stitching and ultimately enhances policy learning. ASTRO outperforms prior offline RL augmentation methods across various algorithms, achieving notable performance gain on the challenging OGBench suite and demonstrating consistent improvements on standard offline RL benchmarks such as D4RL.</p></details> |  |

Rectified Flow enables one-step sampling by learning nearly straight probability paths, but achieving such straightness requires multiple computationally intensive reflow iterations. MeanFlow achieves one-step generation by directly modeling the average velocity over time; however, when trained on highly curved flows, it suffers from slow convergence and noisy supervision. To address these limitations, we propose Rectified MeanFlow, a framework that models the mean velocity field along the rectified trajectory using only a single reflow step. This eliminates the need for perfectly straightened trajectories while enabling efficient training. Furthermore, we introduce a simple yet effective truncation heuristic that aims to reduce residual curvature and further improve performance. Extensive experiments on ImageNet at 64, 256, and 512 resolutions show that Re-MeanFlow consistently outperforms prior one-step flow distillation and Rectified Flow methods in both sample quality and training efficiency.

Segmentation-oriented industrial anomaly synthesis (SIAS) has emerged as a promising alternative; however, existing methods struggle to balance sampling efficiency and generation quality. Moreover, most approaches treat all spatial regions uniformly, overlooking the distinct statistical differences between anomaly and background areas. This uniform treatment hinders the synthesis of controllable, structure-specific anomalies tailored for segmentation tasks. In this paper, we propose FAST, a foreground-aware diffusion framework featuring two novel modules: the Anomaly-Informed Accelerated Sampling (AIAS) and the Foreground-Aware Reconstruction Module (FARM). AIAS is a training-free sampling algorithm specifically designed for segmentation-oriented industrial anomaly synthesis, which accelerates the reverse process through coarse-to-fine aggregation and enables the synthesis of state-of-the-art segmentation-oriented anomalies in as few as 10 steps. Meanwhile, FARM adaptively adjusts the anomaly-aware noise within the masked foreground regions at each sampling step, preserving localized anomaly signals throughout the denoising trajectory. Extensive experiments on multiple industrial benchmarks demonstrate that FAST consistently outperforms existing anomaly synthesis methods in downstream segmentation tasks. We release the code at: https://github.com/Chhro123/fast-foreground-aware-anomaly-synthesis.</p></details> |  |

In contrast, simple robotic grippers have low dexterity and fail to handle small objects effectively. This is why many automation tasks remain unsolved by robots. This paper presents an optimization-based framework for in-hand manipulation with a robotic hand equipped with compact Magnetic Tactile Sensors (MTSs). The small form factor of the robotic hand from Shadow Robot introduces challenges in estimating the state of the object while satisfying contact constraints. To address this, we formulate a trajectory optimization problem using Nonlinear Programming (NLP) for finger movements while ensuring contact points to change along the geometry of the fingers. Using the optimized trajectory from the solver, we implement and test an open-loop controller for rolling motion. To further enhance robustness and accuracy, we introduce a force controller for the fingers and a state estimator for the object utilizing MTSs. The proposed framework is validated through comparative experiments, showing that incorporating the force control with compliance consideration improves the accuracy and robustness of the rolling motion. Rolling an object with the force controller is 30\% more likely to succeed than running an open-loop controller.

Despite great efforts, it remains challenging to explicitly learn and predict latencies, i.e., response intervals or temporal delays with which agents respond to various trajectory-changing events and adjust their future paths, whether on their own or interactively. Different agents may exhibit distinct latency preferences for noticing, processing, and reacting to a specific trajectory-changing event. The lack of consideration of such latencies may undermine the causal continuity of forecasting systems, leading to implausible or unintended trajectories. Inspired by reverberation in acoustics, we propose a new reverberation transform and the corresponding Reverberation (short for Rev) trajectory prediction model, which predicts both individual latency preferences and their stochastic variations accordingly, by using two explicit and learnable reverberation kernels, enabling latency-conditioned and controllable trajectory prediction of both non-interactive and social latencies. Experiments on multiple datasets, whether pedestrians or vehicles, demonstrate that Rev achieves competitive accuracy while revealing interpretable latency dynamics across agents and scenarios. Qualitative analyses further verify the properties of the reverberation transform, highlighting its potential as a general latency modeling approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[Attention Trajectories as a Diagnostic Axis for Deep Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20591v2)** | 2025-11-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While deep reinforcement learning agents demonstrate high performance across domains, their internal decision processes remain difficult to interpret when evaluated only through performance metrics. In particular, it is poorly understood which input features agents rely on, how these dependencies evolve during training, and how they relate to behavior. We introduce a scientific methodology for analyzing the learning process through quantitative analysis of saliency. This approach aggregates saliency information at the object and modality level into hierarchical attention profiles, quantifying how agents allocate attention over time, thereby forming attention trajectories throughout training. Applied to Atari benchmarks, custom Pong environments, and muscle-actuated biomechanical user simulations in visuomotor interactive tasks, this methodology uncovers algorithm-specific attention biases, reveals unintended reward-driven strategies, and diagnoses overfitting to redundant sensory channels. These patterns correspond to measurable behavioral differences, demonstrating empirical links between attention profiles, learning dynamics, and agent behavior. To assess robustness of the attention profiles, we validate our findings across multiple saliency methods and environments. The results establish attention trajectories as a promising diagnostic axis for tracing how feature reliance develops during training and for identifying biases and vulnerabilities invisible to performance metrics alone.</p></details> |  |

Within our method, a ViT encoder takes raw images and past kinematic state as input and is trained to produce context embeddings, drawing inspiration from those generated by the recent MTR (Motion Transformer) encoder, effectively substituting map-based features with learned visual representations. MTR provides a strong foundation for multimodal trajectory prediction by localizing agent intent and refining motion iteratively via motion query pairs; we name our approach MTR-VP (Motion Transformer for Vision-based Planning), and instead of the learnable intention queries used in the MTR decoder, we use cross attention on the intent and the context embeddings, which reflect a combination of information encoded from the driving scene and past vehicle states. We evaluate our methods on the Waymo End-to-End Driving Dataset, which requires predicting the agent's future 5-second trajectory in bird's-eye-view coordinates using prior camera images, agent pose history, and routing goals. We analyze our architecture using ablation studies, removing input images and multiple trajectory output. Our results suggest that transformer-based methods that are used to combine the visual features along with the kinetic features such as the past trajectory features are not effective at combining both modes to produce useful scene context embeddings, even when intention embeddings are augmented with foundation-model representations of scene context from CLIP and DINOv2, but that predicting a distribution over multiple futures instead of a single future trajectory boosts planning performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 3 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |
| **[Personalized 3D Spatiotemporal Trajectory Privacy Protection with Differential and Distortion Geo-Perturbation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22180v1)** | 2025-11-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancement of location-based services (LBSs) in three-dimensional (3D) domains, such as smart cities and intelligent transportation, has raised concerns over 3D spatiotemporal trajectory privacy protection. However, existing research has not fully addressed the risk of attackers exploiting the spatiotemporal correlation of 3D spatiotemporal trajectories and the impact of height information, both of which can potentially lead to significant privacy leakage. To address these issues, this paper proposes a personalized 3D spatiotemporal trajectory privacy protection mechanism, named 3DSTPM. First, we analyze the characteristics of attackers that exploit spatiotemporal correlations between locations in a trajectory and present the attack model. Next, we exploit the complementary characteristics of 3D geo-indistinguishability (3D-GI) and distortion privacy to find a protection location set (PLS) that obscures the real location for all possible locations. To address the issue of privacy accumulation caused by continuous trajectory queries, we propose a Window-based Adaptive Privacy Budget Allocation (W-APBA), which dynamically allocates privacy budgets to all locations in the current PLS based on their predictability and sensitivity. Finally, we perturb the real location using the allocated privacy budget by the PF (Permute-and-Flip) mechanism, effectively balancing privacy protection and Quality of Service (QoS). Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed 3DSTPM effectively reduces QoS loss while meeting the user's personalized privacy protection needs.</p></details> |  |
| **[SparseWorld-TC: Trajectory-Conditioned Sparse Occupancy World Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22039v1)** | 2025-11-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces a novel architecture for trajectory-conditioned forecasting of future 3D scene occupancy. In contrast to methods that rely on variational autoencoders (VAEs) to generate discrete occupancy tokens, which inherently limit representational capacity, our approach predicts multi-frame future occupancy in an end-to-end manner directly from raw image features. Inspired by the success of attention-based transformer architectures in foundational vision and language models such as GPT and VGGT, we employ a sparse occupancy representation that bypasses the intermediate bird's eye view (BEV) projection and its explicit geometric priors. This design allows the transformer to capture spatiotemporal dependencies more effectively. By avoiding both the finite-capacity constraint of discrete tokenization and the structural limitations of BEV representations, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the nuScenes benchmark for 1-3 second occupancy forecasting, outperforming existing approaches by a significant margin. Furthermore, it demonstrates robust scene dynamics understanding, consistently delivering high accuracy under arbitrary future trajectory conditioning.</p></details> |  |

This paper is the first to systematically investigate this seemingly implausible question. Towards this end, we propose a contrastive learning framework to train CamFormer, a dedicated encoder that projects camera pose trajectories into a joint embedding space, aligning them with natural language. We find that, contrary to its apparent simplicity, the camera trajectory is a remarkably informative signal to uncover video content. In other words, "how you move" can indeed reveal "what you are doing" (egocentric) or "observing" (exocentric). We demonstrate the versatility of our learned CamFormer embeddings on a diverse suite of downstream tasks, ranging from cross-modal alignment to classification and temporal analysis. Importantly, our representations are robust across diverse camera pose estimation methods, including both high-fidelity multi-sensored and standard RGB-only estimators. Our findings establish camera trajectory as a lightweight, robust, and versatile modality for perceiving video content.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project website: https://sites.google.com/view/seeing-without-pixels</p></details> |
| **[Using Text-Based Life Trajectories from Swedish Register Data to Predict Residential Mobility with Pretrained Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07865v1)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We transform large-scale Swedish register data into textual life trajectories to address two long-standing challenges in data analysis: high cardinality of categorical variables and inconsistencies in coding schemes over time. Leveraging this uniquely comprehensive population register, we convert register data from 6.9 million individuals (2001-2013) into semantically rich texts and predict individuals' residential mobility in later years (2013-2017). These life trajectories combine demographic information with annual changes in residence, work, education, income, and family circumstances, allowing us to assess how effectively such sequences support longitudinal prediction. We compare multiple NLP architectures (including LSTM, DistilBERT, BERT, and Qwen) and find that sequential and transformer-based models capture temporal and semantic structure more effectively than baseline models. The results show that textualized register data preserves meaningful information about individual pathways and supports complex, scalable modeling. Because few countries maintain longitudinal microdata with comparable coverage and precision, this dataset enables analyses and methodological tests that would be difficult or impossible elsewhere, offering a rigorous testbed for developing and evaluating new sequence-modeling approaches. Overall, our findings demonstrate that combining semantically rich register data with modern language models can substantially advance longitudinal analysis in social sciences.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we present a diffusion-based trajectory planning framework that is both rapid and safe. First, we introduce a scene-agnostic, MPC-based data generation pipeline that efficiently produces large volumes of kinematically feasible trajectories. Building on this dataset, our integrated diffusion planner maps raw onboard sensor inputs directly to kinematically feasible trajectories, enabling efficient inference while maintaining strong collision avoidance. To generalize to diverse, previously unseen scenarios, we compose diffusion models at test time, enabling safe behavior without additional training. We further propose a lightweight, rule-based safety filter that, from the candidate set, selects the trajectory meeting safety and kinematic-feasibility requirements. Across seen and unseen settings, the proposed method delivers real-time-capable inference with high safety and stability. Experiments on an F1TENTH vehicle demonstrate practicality on real hardware.

| **[HardFlow: Hard-Constrained Sampling for Flow-Matching Models via Trajectory Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08425v2)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion and flow-matching have emerged as powerful methodologies for generative modeling, with remarkable success in capturing complex data distributions and enabling flexible guidance at inference time. Many downstream applications, however, demand enforcing hard constraints on generated samples (for example, robot trajectories must avoid obstacles), a requirement that goes beyond simple guidance. Prevailing projection-based approaches constrain the entire sampling path to the constraint manifold, which is overly restrictive and degrades sample quality. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework that reformulates hard-constrained sampling as a trajectory optimization problem. Our key insight is to leverage numerical optimal control to steer the sampling trajectory so that constraints are satisfied precisely at the terminal time. By exploiting the underlying structure of flow-matching models and adopting techniques from model predictive control, we transform this otherwise complex constrained optimization problem into a tractable surrogate that can be solved efficiently and effectively. Furthermore, this trajectory optimization perspective offers significant flexibility beyond mere constraint satisfaction, allowing for the inclusion of integral costs to minimize distribution shift and terminal objectives to further enhance sample quality, all within a unified framework. We provide a control-theoretic analysis of our method, establishing bounds on the approximation error between our tractable surrogate and the ideal formulation. Extensive experiments across diverse domains, including robotics (planning), partial differential equations (boundary control), and vision (text-guided image editing), demonstrate that our algorithm, which we name $\textit{HardFlow}$, substantially outperforms existing methods in both constraint satisfaction and sample quality.</p></details> |  |
| **[Road Network-Aware Personalized Trajectory Protection with Differential Privacy under Spatiotemporal Correlations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21020v1)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Location-Based Services (LBSs) offer significant convenience to mobile users but pose significant privacy risks, as attackers can infer sensitive personal information through spatiotemporal correlations in user trajectories. Since users' sensitivity to location data varies based on factors such as stay duration, access frequency, and semantic sensitivity, implementing personalized privacy protection is imperative. This paper proposes a Personalized Trajectory Privacy Protection Mechanism (PTPPM) to address these challenges. Our approach begins by modeling an attacker's knowledge of a user's trajectory spatiotemporal correlations, which enables the attacker to identify possible location sets and disregard low-probability location sets. To combat this, we integrate geo-indistinguishability with distortion privacy, allowing users to customize their privacy preferences through a configurable privacy budget and expected inference error bound. This approach provides the theoretical framework for constructing a Protection Location Set (PLS) that obscures users' actual locations. Additionally, we introduce a Personalized Privacy Budget Allocation Algorithm (PPBA), which assesses the sensitivity of locations based on trajectory data and allocates privacy budgets accordingly. This algorithm considers factors such as location semantics and road network constraints. Furthermore, we propose a Permute-and-Flip mechanism that generates perturbed locations while minimizing perturbation distance, thus balancing privacy protection and Quality of Service (QoS). Simulation results demonstrate that our mechanism outperforms existing benchmarks, offering superior privacy protection while maintaining user QoS requirements.</p></details> | 13 pages,10 figures |

We developed a modeling framework that aligns participants by baseline and estimates visit-specific PEs independently of age-related change. Method: Using real data ($N=175$), we estimated within-subject correlations via linear mixed-effects modeling and applied these parameters to simulate longitudinal trajectories for healthy controls (HC) and individuals with schizophrenia (SZ). Simulations incorporated aging, diagnostic differences, and cumulative PE indicators. Generalized estimating equations (GEEs) were fit with and without PEs to compare model performance. Results: Models that ignored PEs inflated estimates of cognitive stability and attenuated HC--SZ group differences. Including visit-specific PEs improved recovery of true trajectories and more accurately distinguished aging effects from learning-related gains. Interaction models further identified that PEs may differ by diagnosis or by age at baseline. Conclusion: Practice effects meaningfully bias longitudinal estimates if left unmodeled. The proposed alignment-based GEE framework provides a principled method to estimate PEs and improves accuracy in both simulated and real-world settings. Keywords: practice effects; repeat testing; serial testing; longitudinal testing; mild cognitive impairment; cognitive change.</p></details> | 14 pages, 3 figures |

This growing deployment presents new challenges for UAV trajectory planning in complex urban environments. However, existing studies often overlook key factors, such as urban airspace constraints and economic efficiency, which are essential in low-altitude economy contexts. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is regarded as a promising solution to these issues, while its practical adoption remains limited by low learning efficiency. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel UAV trajectory planning framework that combines DRL with large language model (LLM) reasoning to enable safe, compliant, and economically viable path planning. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing baselines across multiple metrics, including data collection rate, collision avoidance, successful landing, regulatory compliance, and energy efficiency. These results validate the effectiveness of our approach in addressing UAV trajectory planning key challenges under constraints of the low-altitude economy networking.</p></details> |  |
| **[RefTr: Recurrent Refinement of Confluent Trajectories for 3D Vascular Tree Centerline Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20823v1)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tubular trees, such as blood vessels and lung airways, are essential for material transport within the human body. Accurately detecting their centerlines with correct tree topology is critical for clinical tasks such as diagnosis, treatment planning, and surgical navigation. In these applications, maintaining high recall is crucial, as missing small branches can result in fatal mistakes caused by incomplete assessments or undetected abnormalities. We present RefTr, a 3D image-to-graph model for centerline generation of vascular trees via recurrent refinement of confluent trajectories. RefTr uses a Producer-Refiner architecture based on a Transformer decoder, where the Producer proposes a set of initial confluent trajectories that are recurrently refined by the Refiner to produce final trajectories, which forms the centerline graph. The confluent trajectory representation enables refinement of complete trajectories while explicitly enforcing a valid tree topology. The recurrent refinement scheme improves precision and reuses the same Refiner block across multiple steps, yielding a 2.4x reduction in decoder parameters compared to previous SOTA. We also introduce an efficient non-maximum suppression algorithm for spatial tree graphs to merge duplicate branches and boost precision. Across multiple public centerline datasets, RefTr achieves superior recall and comparable precision to previous SOTA, while offering faster inference and substantially fewer parameters, demonstrating its potential as a new state-of-the-art framework for vascular tree analysis in 3D medical imaging.</p></details> |  |

This tutorial bridges this gap by demonstrating the steps and code of a minimal implementation of a trajectory-focused foundation model starting from GPT-2. Through a concise, step-by-step, code-driven process, we demonstrate adapting GPT-2 for spatiotemporal data. We then review and compare representative trajectory foundation models, such as TrajFM and TrajGPT, highlighting their architectural innovations and differences. Additionally, we introduce complementary techniques from related domains, like TimesFM's patching approach. Targeted at researchers and practitioners, this tutorial aims to explain the concepts and terminology of foundation models, at the implementation level. We find it timely and indispensable to create this educational material in order to support the SIGSPATIAL community in building and evaluating mobility foundation models, enhancing both research clarity and peer-review effectiveness in mobility AI.</p></details> |  |
| **[Image-Free Timestep Distillation via Continuous-Time Consistency with Trajectory-Sampled Pairs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20410v1)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Timestep distillation is an effective approach for improving the generation efficiency of diffusion models. The Consistency Model (CM), as a trajectory-based framework, demonstrates significant potential due to its strong theoretical foundation and high-quality few-step generation. Nevertheless, current continuous-time consistency distillation methods still rely heavily on training data and computational resources, hindering their deployment in resource-constrained scenarios and limiting their scalability to diverse domains. To address this issue, we propose Trajectory-Backward Consistency Model (TBCM), which eliminates the dependence on external training data by extracting latent representations directly from the teacher model's generation trajectory. Unlike conventional methods that require VAE encoding and large-scale datasets, our self-contained distillation paradigm significantly improves both efficiency and simplicity. Moreover, the trajectory-extracted samples naturally bridge the distribution gap between training and inference, thereby enabling more effective knowledge transfer. Empirically, TBCM achieves 6.52 FID and 28.08 CLIP scores on MJHQ-30k under one-step generation, while reducing training time by approximately 40% compared to Sana-Sprint and saving a substantial amount of GPU memory, demonstrating superior efficiency without sacrificing quality. We further reveal the diffusion-generation space discrepancy in continuous-time consistency distillation and analyze how sampling strategies affect distillation performance, offering insights for future distillation research.

This is primarily due to the inherent lack of 3D ground truth trajectories and spin annotations for real-world video. To overcome this, we propose a novel two-stage pipeline that divides the problem into a front-end perception task and a back-end 2D-to-3D uplifting task. This separation allows us to train the front-end components with abundant 2D supervision from our newly created TTHQ dataset, while the back-end uplifting network is trained exclusively on physically-correct synthetic data. We specifically re-engineer the uplifting model to be robust to common real-world artifacts, such as missing detections and varying frame rates. By integrating a ball detector and a table keypoint detector, our approach transforms a proof-of-concept uplifting method into a practical, robust, and high-performing end-to-end application for 3D table tennis trajectory and spin analysis.</p></details> |  |

We experiment with ten open-source libraries to comprehensively evaluate available tools, comparing their efficiency and accuracy in identifying and cleaning outliers. This experiment considers the libraries as they are offered to end users, with real-world applicability. We compare existing outlier detection libraries, introduce a method for establishing ground-truth, and aim to guide users in choosing the most appropriate tool for their specific outlier detection needs. Furthermore, we survey the state-of-the-art algorithms for outlier detection and classify them into five types: Statistic-based methods, Sliding window algorithms, Clustering-based methods, Graph-based methods, and Heuristic-based methods.

However, existing vision-language models (VLMs) often fail to accurately understand driving scenes and generate trustworthy trajectories. To address this challenge, this paper introduces KEPT, a knowledge-enhanced VLM framework that predicts ego trajectories directly from consecutive front-view driving frames. KEPT integrates a temporal frequency-spatial fusion (TFSF) video encoder, which is trained via self-supervised learning with hard-negative mining, with a k-means & HNSW retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline. Retrieved prior knowledge is added into chain-of-thought (CoT) prompts with explicit planning constraints, while a triple-stage fine-tuning paradigm aligns the VLM backbone to enhance spatial perception and trajectory prediction capabilities. Evaluated on nuScenes dataset, KEPT achieves the best open-loop performance compared with baseline methods. Ablation studies on fine-tuning stages, Top-K value of RAG, different retrieval strategies, vision encoders, and VLM backbones are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of KEPT. These results indicate that KEPT offers a promising, data-efficient way toward trustworthy trajectory prediction in autonomous driving.</p></details> |  |

These embeddings are then further optimized during denoising time steps via trajectory alignment between the predicted and target velocities using a flow-matching objective. To keep the output faithful to the text prompt and prevent duplicate generations, we incorporate a regularization term based on the phase components of the reference video's Fourier transform, projecting the phase angles onto a smooth manifold to suppress high-frequency artifacts.

Prior work has focused on endpoint metrics (e.g., fidelity, likelihood, perceptual quality) while overlooking a deeper question: what do the sampling trajectories reveal? Motivated by classical mechanics, we introduce kinetic path energy (KPE), a simple yet powerful diagnostic that quantifies the total kinetic effort along each generation path of ODE-based samplers. Through comprehensive experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet-256, we uncover two key phenomena: ({i}) higher KPE predicts stronger semantic quality, indicating that semantically richer samples require greater kinetic effort, and ({ii}) higher KPE inversely correlates with data density, with informative samples residing in sparse, low-density regions. Together, these findings reveal that semantically informative samples naturally reside on the sparse frontier of the data distribution, demanding greater generative effort. Our results suggest that trajectory-level analysis offers a physics-inspired and interpretable framework for understanding generation difficulty and sample characteristics.</p></details> | <details><summary>EurIP...</summary><p>EurIPS 2025 Workshop on Principles of Generative Modeling (PriGM)</p></details> |

However, HD map-dependent models suffer from costly data acquisition, delayed updates, and vulnerability to corrupted inputs, causing prediction failures. Map-free approaches lack global context, with pairwise attention over-amplifying straight patterns while suppressing transitional patterns, resulting in motion-intention misalignment. This paper proposes GContextFormer, a plug-and-play encoder-decoder architecture with global context-aware hybrid attention and scaled additive aggregation achieving intention-aligned multimodal prediction without map reliance. The Motion-Aware Encoder builds scene-level intention prior via bounded scaled additive aggregation over mode-embedded trajectory tokens and refines per-mode representations under shared global context, mitigating inter-mode suppression and promoting intention alignment. The Hierarchical Interaction Decoder decomposes social reasoning into dual-pathway cross-attention: a standard pathway ensures uniform geometric coverage over agent-mode pairs while a neighbor-context-enhanced pathway emphasizes salient interactions, with gating module mediating their contributions to maintain coverage-focus balance. Experiments on eight highway-ramp scenarios from TOD-VT dataset show GContextFormer outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. Compared to existing transformer models, GContextFormer achieves greater robustness and concentrated improvements in high-curvature and transition zones via spatial distributions. Interpretability is achieved through motion mode distinctions and neighbor context modulation exposing reasoning attribution. The modular architecture supports extensibility toward cross-domain multimodal reasoning tasks. Source: https://fenghy-chen.github.io/sources/.</p></details> |  |

Most current data is obtained via human teleoperation, which is expensive and difficult to scale. Reinforcement learning (RL) methods learn useful skills through autonomous exploration, making them a viable approach for generating data. However, standard RL training collapses to a narrow execution pattern, limiting its utility for large-scale pre-training. We propose Discover, Lea rn and Reinforce (DLR), an information-theoretic pattern discovery framework that generates multiple distinct, high-success behavioral patterns for VLA pretraining. Empirically, DLR generates a markedly more diverse trajectory corpus on LIBERO. Specifically, it learns multiple distinct, high-success strategies for the same task where standard RL discovers only one, and hence it covers substantially broader regions of the state-action space. When adapted to unseen downstream task suites, VLA models pretrained on our diverse RL data surpass counterparts trained on equal-sized standard RL datasets. Moreover, DLR exhibits positive data-scaling behavior that single-pattern RL lacks. These results position multi-pattern RL as a practical, scalable data engine for embodied foundation models.</p></details> |  |

Among flow models' accelerating methods, ReFlow has been somehow overlooked although it has theoretical consistency with flow matching. This is primarily due to its suboptimal performance in practical scenarios compared to consistency distillation and score distillation. In this work, we investigate this issue within the ReFlow framework and propose FlowSteer, a method unlocks the potential of ReFlow-based distillation by guiding the student along teacher's authentic generation trajectories. We first identify that Piecewised ReFlow's performance is hampered by a critical distribution mismatch during the training and propose Online Trajectory Alignment(OTA) to resolve it. Then, we introduce a adversarial distillation objective applied directly on the ODE trajectory, improving the student's adherence to the teacher's generation trajectory. Furthermore, we find and fix a previously undiscovered flaw in the widely-used FlowMatchEulerDiscreteScheduler that largely degrades few-step inference quality.

Imitating a single expert trajectory, as in regression-based approaches, usually does not explicitly assess the safety of the predicted trajectory. Selection-based methods address this by generating and scoring multiple trajectory candidates and predicting the safety score for each. However, they face optimization challenges in precisely selecting the best option from thousands of candidates and distinguishing subtle but safety-critical differences, especially in rare and challenging scenarios. We propose DriveSuprim to overcome these challenges and advance the selection-based paradigm through a coarse-to-fine paradigm for progressive candidate filtering, a rotation-based augmentation method to improve robustness in out-of-distribution scenarios, and a self-distillation framework to stabilize training. DriveSuprim achieves state-of-the-art performance, reaching 93.5% PDMS in NAVSIM v1 and 87.1% EPDMS in NAVSIM v2 without extra data, with 83.02 Driving Score and 60.00 Success Rate on the Bench2Drive benchmark, demonstrating superior planning capabilities in various driving scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AAAI 2026</p></details> |

In this paper, we propose an efficient controller for trajectory tracking of marine vehicles under unknown disturbances by combining a convex error-state MPC on the Lie group with an online learning module to compensate for these disturbances in real time. This design enables adaptive and robust control while maintaining computational efficiency. Extensive evaluations in numerical simulations, the Virtual RobotX (VRX) simulator, and real-world field experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior tracking accuracy under various disturbance scenarios compared with existing approaches.</p></details> |  |

Accurate prediction enables realistic simulation and strategic understanding of gameplay evolution. Most existing models are evaluated solely on per-agent accuracy metrics (minADE, minFDE), which assess each agent independently on its best-of-k prediction. However these metrics overlook whether the model learns which predicted trajectories can jointly form a plausible multi-agent future. Many state-of-the-art models are designed and optimized primarily based on these metrics. As a result, they may underperform on joint predictions and also fail to generate coherent, interpretable multi-agent scenarios in team sports. We propose CausalTraj, a temporally causal, likelihood-based model that is built to generate jointly probable multi-agent trajectory forecasts. To better assess collective modeling capability, we emphasize joint metrics (minJADE, minJFDE) that measure joint accuracy across agents within the best generated scenario sample. Evaluated on the NBA SportVU, Basketball-U, and Football-U datasets, CausalTraj achieves competitive per-agent accuracy and the best recorded results on joint metrics, while yielding qualitatively coherent and realistic gameplay evolutions.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 3 figures, accepted to the AI4TS Workshop at AAAI 2026</p></details> |
| **[ResAD: Normalized Residual Trajectory Modeling for End-to-End Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08562v2)** | 2025-11-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>End-to-end autonomous driving (E2EAD) systems, which learn to predict future trajectories directly from sensor data, are fundamentally challenged by the inherent spatio-temporal imbalance of trajectory data. This imbalance creates a significant optimization burden, causing models to learn spurious correlations instead of robust driving logic, while also prioritizing uncertain, distant predictions, thereby compromising immediate safety. To address these issues, we propose ResAD, a novel Normalized Residual Trajectory Modeling framework. Instead of predicting the future trajectory directly, our approach reframes and simplifies the learning task by predicting the residual deviation from a deterministic inertial reference. This inertial reference serves as a strong physical prior, compelling the model to move beyond simple pattern-matching and instead focus its capacity on learning the necessary, context-driven deviations (e.g., traffic rules, obstacles) from this default, inertially-guided path. To mitigate the optimization imbalance caused by uncertain, long-term horizons, ResAD further incorporates Point-wise Normalization of the predicted residual. This technique re-weights the optimization objective, preventing large-magnitude errors associated with distant, uncertain waypoints from dominating the learning signal. On the NAVSIM v1 and v2 benchmarks, ResAD achieves state-of-the-art results of 88.8 PDMS and 85.5 EPDMS with only two denoising steps, demonstrating that ResAD significantly simplifies the learning task and improves planning performance. The code will be released to facilitate further research.</p></details> |  |

However, in dense traffic scenarios, frequent identity switching of targets hinders cross-view association and fusion. Meanwhile, multi-source information tends to generate redundant interactions during the encoding stage, and traditional vehicle-centric encoding leads to large amounts of repetitive historical trajectory feature encoding, degrading real-time inference performance. To address these challenges, we propose V2X-RECT, a trajectory prediction framework designed for high-density environments. It enhances data association consistency, reduces redundant interactions, and reuses historical information to enable more efficient and accurate prediction. Specifically, we design a multi-source identity matching and correction module that leverages multi-view spatiotemporal relationships to achieve stable and consistent target association, mitigating the adverse effects of mismatches on trajectory encoding and cross-view feature fusion. Then we introduce traffic signal-guided interaction module, encoding trend of traffic light changes as features and exploiting their role in constraining spatiotemporal passage rights to accurately filter key interacting vehicles, while capturing the dynamic impact of signal changes on interaction patterns. Furthermore, a local spatiotemporal coordinate encoding enables reusable features of historical trajectories and map, supporting parallel decoding and significantly improving inference efficiency. Extensive experimental results across V2X-Seq and V2X-Traj datasets demonstrate that our V2X-RECT achieves significant improvements compared to SOTA methods, while also enhancing robustness and inference efficiency across diverse traffic densities.</p></details> |  |
| **[DiffRefiner: Coarse to Fine Trajectory Planning via Diffusion Refinement with Semantic Interaction for End to End Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17150v1)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unlike discriminative approaches in autonomous driving that predict a fixed set of candidate trajectories of the ego vehicle, generative methods, such as diffusion models, learn the underlying distribution of future motion, enabling more flexible trajectory prediction. However, since these methods typically rely on denoising human-crafted trajectory anchors or random noise, there remains significant room for improvement. In this paper, we propose DiffRefiner, a novel two-stage trajectory prediction framework. The first stage uses a transformer-based Proposal Decoder to generate coarse trajectory predictions by regressing from sensor inputs using predefined trajectory anchors. The second stage applies a Diffusion Refiner that iteratively denoises and refines these initial predictions. In this way, we enhance the performance of diffusion-based planning by incorporating a discriminative trajectory proposal module, which provides strong guidance for the generative refinement process. Furthermore, we design a fine-grained denoising decoder to enhance scene compliance, enabling more accurate trajectory prediction through enhanced alignment with the surrounding environment. Experimental results demonstrate that DiffRefiner achieves state-of-the-art performance, attaining 87.4 EPDMS on NAVSIM v2, and 87.1 DS along with 71.4 SR on Bench2Drive, thereby setting new records on both public benchmarks. The effectiveness of each component is validated via ablation studies as well.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AAAI 2026</p></details> |
| **[GeoPTH: A Lightweight Approach to Category-Based Trajectory Retrieval via Geometric Prototype Trajectory Hashing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16258v2)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory similarity retrieval is an important part of spatiotemporal data mining, however, existing methods have the following limitations: traditional metrics are computationally expensive, while learning-based methods suffer from substantial training costs and potential instability. This paper addresses these problems by proposing Geometric Prototype Trajectory Hashing (GeoPTH), a novel, lightweight, and non-learning framework for efficient category-based trajectory retrieval. GeoPTH constructs data-dependent hash functions by using representative trajectory prototypes, i.e., small point sets preserving geometric characteristics, as anchors. The hashing process is efficient, which involves mapping a new trajectory to its closest prototype via a robust, Hausdorff metric. Extensive experiments show that GeoPTH's retrieval accuracy is highly competitive with both traditional metrics and state-of-the-art learning methods, and it significantly outperforms binary codes generated through simple binarization of the learned embeddings. Critically, GeoPTH consistently outperforms all competitors in terms of efficiency. Our work demonstrates that a lightweight, prototype-centric approach offers a practical and powerful alternative, achieving an exceptional retrieval performance and computational efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mask2IV: Interaction-Centric Video Generation via Mask Trajectories](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03135v2)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating interaction-centric videos, such as those depicting humans or robots interacting with objects, is crucial for embodied intelligence, as they provide rich and diverse visual priors for robot learning, manipulation policy training, and affordance reasoning. However, existing methods often struggle to model such complex and dynamic interactions. While recent studies show that masks can serve as effective control signals and enhance generation quality, obtaining dense and precise mask annotations remains a major challenge for real-world use. To overcome this limitation, we introduce Mask2IV, a novel framework specifically designed for interaction-centric video generation. It adopts a decoupled two-stage pipeline that first predicts plausible motion trajectories for both actor and object, then generates a video conditioned on these trajectories. This design eliminates the need for dense mask inputs from users while preserving the flexibility to manipulate the interaction process. Furthermore, Mask2IV supports versatile and intuitive control, allowing users to specify the target object of interaction and guide the motion trajectory through action descriptions or spatial position cues. To support systematic training and evaluation, we curate two benchmarks covering diverse action and object categories across both human-object interaction and robotic manipulation scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior visual realism and controllability compared to existing baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>AAAI ...</summary><p>AAAI 2026.

| **[Lane-Frame Quantum Multimodal Driving Forecasts for the Trajectory of Autonomous Vehicles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17675v1)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory forecasting for autonomous driving must deliver accurate, calibrated multi-modal futures under tight compute and latency constraints. We propose a compact hybrid quantum architecture that aligns quantum inductive bias with road-scene structure by operating in an ego-centric, lane-aligned frame and predicting residual corrections to a kinematic baseline instead of absolute poses. The model combines a transformer-inspired quantum attention encoder (9 qubits), a parameter-lean quantum feedforward stack (64 layers, ${\sim}1200$ trainable angles), and a Fourier-based decoder that uses shallow entanglement and phase superposition to generate 16 trajectory hypotheses in a single pass, with mode confidences derived from the latent spectrum. All circuit parameters are trained with Simultaneous Perturbation Stochastic Approximation (SPSA), avoiding backpropagation through non-analytic components. In the Waymo Open Motion Dataset, the model achieves minADE (minimum Average Displacement Error) of \SI{1.94}{m} and minFDE (minimum Final Displacement Error) of \SI{3.56}{m} in the $16$ models predicted over the horizon of \SI{2.0}{s}, consistently outperforming a kinematic baseline with reduced miss rates and strong recall. Ablations confirm that residual learning in the lane frame, truncated Fourier decoding, shallow entanglement, and spectrum-based ranking focus capacity where it matters, yielding stable optimization and reliable multi-modal forecasts from small, shallow quantum circuits on a modern autonomous-driving benchmark.</p></details> |  |
| **[CroTad: A Contrastive Reinforcement Learning Framework for Online Trajectory Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16929v1)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Detecting trajectory anomalies is a vital task in modern Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), enabling the identification of unsafe, inefficient, or irregular travel behaviours. While deep learning has emerged as the dominant approach, several key challenges remain unresolved. First, sub-trajectory anomaly detection, capable of pinpointing the precise segments where anomalies occur, remains underexplored compared to whole-trajectory analysis. Second, many existing methods depend on carefully tuned thresholds, limiting their adaptability in real-world applications. Moreover, the irregular sampling of trajectory data and the presence of noise in training sets further degrade model performance, making it difficult to learn reliable representations of normal routes. To address these challenges, we propose a contrastive reinforcement learning framework for online trajectory anomaly detection, CroTad. Our method is threshold-free and robust to noisy, irregularly sampled data. By incorporating contrastive learning, CroTad learns to extract diverse normal travel patterns for different itineraries and effectively distinguish anomalous behaviours at both sub-trajectory and point levels. The detection module leverages deep reinforcement learning to perform online, real-time anomaly scoring, enabling timely and fine-grained identification of abnormal segments. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our framework across various evaluation scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 4 figures, will be submitted to VLDBJ</p></details> |
| **[Pathlet Variational Auto-Encoder for Robust Trajectory Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16105v1)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory generation has recently drawn growing interest in privacy-preserving urban mobility studies and location-based service applications. Although many studies have used deep learning or generative AI methods to model trajectories and have achieved promising results, the robustness and interpretability of such models are largely unexplored. This limits the application of trajectory generation algorithms on noisy real-world data and their trustworthiness in downstream tasks. To address this issue, we exploit the regular structure in urban trajectories and propose a deep generative model based on the pathlet representation, which encode trajectories with binary vectors associated with a learned dictionary of trajectory segments. Specifically, we introduce a probabilistic graphical model to describe the trajectory generation process, which includes a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) component and a linear decoder component. During training, the model can simultaneously learn the latent embedding of pathlet representations and the pathlet dictionary that captures mobility patterns in the trajectory dataset. The conditional version of our model can also be used to generate customized trajectories based on temporal and spatial constraints. Our model can effectively learn data distribution even using noisy data, achieving relative improvements of $35.4\%$ and $26.3\%$ over strong baselines on two real-world trajectory datasets. Moreover, the generated trajectories can be conveniently utilized for multiple downstream tasks, including trajectory prediction and data denoising. Lastly, the framework design offers a significant efficiency advantage, saving $64.8\%$ of the time and $56.5\%$ of GPU memory compared to previous approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[Constraint-Guided Prediction Refinement via Deterministic Diffusion Trajectories](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12911v2)** | 2025-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many real-world machine learning tasks require outputs that satisfy hard constraints, such as physical conservation laws, structured dependencies in graphs, or column-level relationships in tabular data. Existing approaches rely either on domain-specific architectures and losses or on strong assumptions on the constraint space, restricting their applicability to linear or convex constraints. We propose a general-purpose framework for constraint-aware refinement that leverages denoising diffusion implicit models (DDIMs). Starting from a coarse prediction, our method iteratively refines it through a deterministic diffusion trajectory guided by a learned prior and augmented by constraint gradient corrections. The approach accommodates a wide class of non-convex and nonlinear equality constraints and can be applied post hoc to any base model. We demonstrate the method in two representative domains: constrained adversarial attack generation on tabular data with column-level dependencies and in AC power flow prediction under Kirchhoff's laws. Across both settings, our diffusion-guided refinement improves both constraint satisfaction and performance while remaining lightweight and model-agnostic.</p></details> |  |
| **[Coresets from Trajectories: Selecting Data via Correlation of Loss Differences](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20230v2)** | 2025-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning models achieve state-of-the-art performance across domains but face scalability challenges in real-time or resource-constrained scenarios. To address this, we propose Correlation of Loss Differences (CLD), a simple and scalable metric for coreset selection that identifies the most impactful training samples by measuring their alignment with the loss trajectories of a held-out validation set. CLD is highly efficient, requiring only per-sample loss values computed at training checkpoints, and avoiding the costly gradient and curvature computations used in many existing subset selection methods. We develop a general theoretical framework that establishes convergence guarantees for CLD-based coresets, demonstrating that the convergence error is upper-bounded by the alignment of the selected samples and the representativeness of the validation set. On CIFAR-100 and ImageNet-1k, CLD-based coresets typically outperform or closely match state-of-the-art methods across subset sizes, and remain within 1% of more computationally expensive baselines even when not leading. CLD transfers effectively across architectures (ResNet, VGG, DenseNet), enabling proxy-to-target selection with <1% degradation. Moreover, CLD is stable when using only early checkpoints, incurring negligible accuracy loss. Finally, CLD exhibits inherent bias reduction via per-class validation alignment, obviating the need for additional stratified sampling. Together, these properties make CLD a principled, efficient, stable, and transferable tool for scalable dataset optimization.</p></details> |  |

In many healthcare applications, for example, a patient may experience multiple clinical events, that can be non-exclusive and semi-competing. A common workaround is to train independent single-event models for such multi-event problems, but this approach fails to exploit dependencies and shared structures across events. To overcome these limitations, we propose MENSA (Multi-Event Network for Survival Analysis), a deep learning model that jointly learns flexible time-to-event distributions for multiple events, whether competing or co-occurring. In addition, we introduce a novel trajectory-based likelihood term that captures the temporal ordering between events. Across four multi-event datasets, MENSA improves predictive performance over many state-of-the-art baselines.

| **[Delay-Oriented Distributed Scheduling with TransGNN](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08799v1)** | 2025-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Minimizing transmission delay in wireless multi-hop networks is a fundamental yet challenging task due to the complex coupling among interference, queue dynamics, and distributed control. Traditional scheduling algorithms, such as max-weight or queue-length-based policies, primarily aim to optimize throughput but often suffer from high latency, especially in heterogeneous or dynamically changing topologies. Recent learning-based approaches, particularly those employing Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), have shown promise in capturing spatial interference structures. However, conventional Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) remain limited by their local aggregation mechanism and their inability to model long-range dependencies within the conflict graph. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a delay-oriented distributed scheduling framework based on Transformer GNN. The proposed model employs an attention-based graph encoder to generate adaptive per-link utility scores that reflect both queue backlog and interference intensity. A Local Greedy Solver (LGS) then utilizes these utilities to construct a feasible independent set of links for transmission, ensuring distributed and conflict-free scheduling.</p></details> | 10 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Learning and Editing Universal Graph Prompt Tuning via Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08763v1)** | 2025-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Early graph prompt tuning approaches relied on task-specific designs for Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), limiting their adaptability across diverse pre-training strategies. In contrast, another promising line of research has investigated universal graph prompt tuning, which operates directly in the input graph's feature space and builds a theoretical foundation that universal graph prompt tuning can theoretically achieve an equivalent effect of any prompting function, eliminating dependence on specific pre-training strategies. Recent works propose selective node-based graph prompt tuning to pursue more ideal prompts. However, we argue that selective node-based graph prompt tuning inevitably compromises the theoretical foundation of universal graph prompt tuning. In this paper, we strengthen the theoretical foundation of universal graph prompt tuning by introducing stricter constraints, demonstrating that adding prompts to all nodes is a necessary condition for achieving the universality of graph prompts. To this end, we propose a novel model and paradigm, Learning and Editing Universal GrAph Prompt Tuning (LEAP), which preserves the theoretical foundation of universal graph prompt tuning while pursuing more ideal prompts. Specifically, we first build the basic universal graph prompts to preserve the theoretical foundation and then employ actor-critic reinforcement learning to select nodes and edit prompts. Extensive experiments on graph- and node-level tasks across various pre-training strategies in both full-shot and few-shot scenarios show that LEAP consistently outperforms fine-tuning and other prompt-based approaches.</p></details> | Accepted by KDD 2026 |

Anticipating basketball events requires understanding both physical motion patterns and their semantic significance in the context of the game. Traditional approaches that use only player positions fail to capture crucial indicators such as body orientation, defensive stance, or shooting preparation motions. Our two-stage approach first processes skeletal tracking data through Graph Neural Networks to capture nuanced motion patterns, then employs a Transformer architecture with specialized attention mechanisms to model player interactions. We introduce event projection heads that explicitly connect player movements to basketball events like passes, shots, and steals, training the model to associate physical motion patterns with their tactical purposes. Experiments on NBA tracking data demonstrate significant improvements over position-only baselines: 35% reduction in trajectory prediction error compared to state-of-the-art position-based models and consistent performance gains across key basketball analytics tasks. The resulting pretrained model serves as a powerful foundation for multiple downstream tasks, with pick detection, shot taker identification, assist prediction, shot location classification, and shot type recognition demonstrating substantial improvements over existing methods.</p></details> |  |

Traditional models rely mainly on historical prices, but recent work shows that financial news can provide useful external signals. This paper investigates a multimodal approach that integrates companies' news articles with their historical stock data to improve prediction performance. We compare a Graph Neural Network (GNN) model with a baseline LSTM model. Historical data for each company is encoded using an LSTM, while news titles are embedded with a language model. These embeddings form nodes in a heterogeneous graph, and GraphSAGE is used to capture interactions between articles, companies, and industries. We evaluate two targets: a binary direction-of-change label and a significance-based label. Experiments on the US equities and Bloomberg datasets show that the GNN outperforms the LSTM baseline, achieving 53% accuracy on the first target and a 4% precision gain on the second. Results also indicate that companies with more associated news yield higher prediction accuracy. Moreover, headlines contain stronger predictive signals than full articles, suggesting that concise news summaries play an important role in short-term market reactions.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 6 figures.

Message-passing heterogeneous graph neural networks (HGNNs) have emerged as a powerful model class for such data. However, existing HGNNs typically allocate a separate set of learnable weights for each relation type to model relational heterogeneity. Despite their promise, these models are effective primarily on simple heterogeneous graphs with only a few relation types. In this paper, we show that this standard design inherently leads to parameter explosion (the number of learnable parameters grows rapidly with the number of relation types) and relation collapse (the model loses the ability to distinguish among different relations). These issues make existing HGNNs inefficient or impractical for complex heterogeneous graphs with many relation types. To address these challenges, we propose Blend&Grind-HGNN (BG-HGNN), a unified feature-representation framework that integrates and distills relational heterogeneity into a shared low-dimensional feature space. This design eliminates the need for relation-specific parameter sets and enables efficient, expressive learning even as the number of relations grows. Empirically, BG-HGNN achieves substantial gains over state-of-the-art HGNNs, improving parameter efficiency by up to 28.96x and training throughput by up to 110.30x, while matching or surpassing their accuracy on complex heterogeneous graphs.</p></details> |  |

The wide adoption in numerous applications underscores the value of these models. However, the complexity of these methods often impedes understanding their decision-making processes. Current Explainable AI (XAI) methods struggle to untangle the intricate relationships and interactions within graphs. Several methods have tried to bridge this gap via a post-hoc approach or self-interpretable design. Most of them focus on graph structure analysis to determine essential patterns that correlate with prediction outcomes. While post-hoc explanation methods are adaptable, they require extra computational resources and may be less reliable due to limited access to the model's internal workings. Conversely, Interpretable models can provide immediate explanations, but their generalizability to different scenarios remains a major concern. To address these shortcomings, this thesis seeks to develop a novel XAI framework tailored for graph-based machine learning. The proposed framework aims to offer adaptable, computationally efficient explanations for GNNs, moving beyond individual feature analysis to capture how graph structure influences predictions.</p></details> | <details><summary>157 p...</summary><p>157 pages, Doctoral dissertation at Seoul National University (submitted in 2024.08 to SNU library, slightly updated in 2025.11 for open digital version)</p></details> |
| **[gHAWK: Local and Global Structure Encoding for Scalable Training of Graph Neural Networks on Knowledge Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08274v1)** | 2025-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knowledge Graphs (KGs) are a rich source of structured, heterogeneous data, powering a wide range of applications. A common approach to leverage this data is to train a graph neural network (GNN) on the KG. However, existing message-passing GNNs struggle to scale to large KGs because they rely on the iterative message passing process to learn the graph structure, which is inefficient, especially under mini-batch training, where a node sees only a partial view of its neighborhood. In this paper, we address this problem and present gHAWK, a novel and scalable GNN training framework for large KGs. The key idea is to precompute structural features for each node that capture its local and global structure before GNN training even begins. Specifically, gHAWK introduces a preprocessing step that computes: (a)~Bloom filters to compactly encode local neighborhood structure, and (b)~TransE embeddings to represent each node's global position in the graph. These features are then fused with any domain-specific features (e.g., text embeddings), producing a node feature vector that can be incorporated into any GNN technique. By augmenting message-passing training with structural priors, gHAWK significantly reduces memory usage, accelerates convergence, and improves model accuracy. Extensive experiments on large datasets from the Open Graph Benchmark (OGB) demonstrate that gHAWK achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and lower training time on both node property prediction and link prediction tasks, topping the OGB leaderboard for three graphs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards agent-based-model informed neural networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05764v2)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this article, we present a framework for designing neural networks that remain consistent with the underlying principles of agent-based models. We begin by highlighting the limitations of standard neural differential equations in modeling complex systems, where physical invariants (like energy) are often absent but other constraints (like mass conservation, information locality, bounded rationality) must be enforced. To address this, we introduce Agent-Based-Model informed Neural Networks (ABM-NNs), which leverage restricted graph neural networks and hierarchical decomposition to learn interpretable, structure-preserving dynamics. We validate the framework across three case studies of increasing complexity: (i) a generalized Generalized Lotka--Volterra system, where we recover ground-truth parameters from short trajectories in presence of interventions; (ii) a graph-based SIR contagion model, where our method outperforms state-of-the-art graph learning baselines (GCN, GraphSAGE, Graph Transformer) in out-of-sample forecasting and noise robustness; and (iii) a real-world macroeconomic model of the ten largest economies, where we learn coupled GDP dynamics from empirical data and demonstrate counterfactual analysis for policy interventions</p></details> |  |

Although successful, these methods fail to leverage the relational information between samples for generating label predictions. In recent works, graph-based learning techniques, namely Laplace learning, have been heuristically combined with neural networks for both supervised and semi-supervised learning (SSL) tasks. However, prior works approximate the gradient of the loss function with respect to the graph learning algorithm or decouple the processes; end-to-end integration with neural networks is not achieved. In this work, we derive backpropagation equations, via the adjoint method, for inclusion of a general family of graph learning layers into a neural network. The resulting method, distinct from graph neural networks, allows us to precisely integrate similarity graph construction and graph Laplacian-based label propagation into a neural network layer, replacing a projection head and softmax activation function for general classification task. Our experimental results demonstrate smooth label transitions across data, improved generalization and robustness to adversarial attacks, and improved training dynamics compared to a standard softmax-based approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>58 pa...</summary><p>58 pages, 12 figures.

Although many platforms attempt to curb incivility through moderation and automated detection, the performance of existing approaches often remains limited in both accuracy and efficiency. To address this challenge, we propose a Graph Neural Network (GNN) framework for detecting three types of uncivil behavior (i.e., toxicity, aggression, and personal attacks) within the English Wikipedia community. Our model represents each user comment as a node, with textual similarity between comments defining the edges, allowing the network to jointly learn from both linguistic content and relational structures among comments. We also introduce a dynamically adjusted attention mechanism that adaptively balances nodal and topological features during information aggregation. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our proposed architecture outperforms 12 state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs) across multiple metrics while requiring significantly lower inference cost. These findings highlight the crucial role of structural context in detecting online incivility and address the limitations of text-only LLM paradigms in behavioral prediction. All datasets and comparative outputs will be publicly available in our repository to support further research and reproducibility.</p></details> | 10 pages |
| **[Physics-Informed Inductive Biases for Voltage Prediction in Distribution Grids](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25158v2)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Voltage prediction in distribution grids is a critical yet difficult task for maintaining power system stability. Machine learning approaches, particularly Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), offer significant speedups but suffer from poor generalization when trained on limited or incomplete data. In this work, we systematically investigate the role of inductive biases in improving a model's ability to reliably learn power flow. Specifically, we evaluate three physics-informed strategies: (i) power-flow-constrained loss functions, (ii) complex-valued neural networks, and (iii) residual-based task reformulation. Using the ENGAGE dataset, which spans multiple low- and medium-voltage grid configurations, we conduct controlled experiments to isolate the effect of each inductive bias and assess both standard predictive performance and out-of-distribution generalization. Our study provides practical insights into which model assumptions most effectively guide learning for reliable and efficient voltage prediction in modern distribution networks.</p></details> |  |

We address this problem by formulating interference mitigation as a dynamic graph regression task and propose JaGuard, a receiver-centric temporal graph neural network that estimates and corrects latitude and longitude errors. At each 1 Hz epoch, the satellite-receiver scene is represented as a heterogeneous star graph with time-varying satellite attributes such as SNR, azimuth and elevation. A single-layer HeteroGCLSTM fuses one-hop spatial context with short-term temporal dynamics to produce a 2D deviation estimate. We evaluate JaGuard on data collected from two commercial receivers under controlled conducted jamming using three jammer types (CW, 3xCW, FM) and six power levels from -45 to -70 dBm, each repeated 50 times across pre-jam, jam, and recovery phases. JaGuard outperforms strong multivariate baselines (TSMixer, uniform CNN, Seq2Point) in all conditions. Under severe jamming at -45 dBm, it achieves 3.64-7.74 cm MAE, improving to 1.59-1.90 cm for -60 to -70 dBm. On mixed-mode datasets, it attains 3.78 cm MAE on GP01 and 4.25 cm on U-blox 10. With only 10 percent of the training data, JaGuard remains ahead, reaching about 20 cm MAE compared to 36-42 cm for the baselines.</p></details> | 12 pages, 7 figures |

There is a growing need for scalable algorithms capable of handling the increasing variability, constraints, and uncertainties in modern power networks while providing accurate and fast solutions. To address this, machine learning techniques, particularly Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as promising approaches. This letter introduces PowerGraph-LLM, the first framework explicitly designed for solving OPF problems using Large Language Models (LLMs). The proposed approach combines graph and tabular representations of power grids to effectively query LLMs, capturing the complex relationships and constraints in power systems. A new implementation of in-context learning and fine-tuning protocols for LLMs is introduced, tailored specifically for the OPF problem. PowerGraph-LLM demonstrates reliable performances using off-the-shelf LLM. Our study reveals the impact of LLM architecture, size, and fine-tuning and demonstrates our framework's ability to handle realistic grid components and constraints.</p></details> |  |
| **[Forget and Explain: Transparent Verification of GNN Unlearning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07450v1)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) are increasingly used to model complex patterns in graph-structured data. However, enabling them to "forget" designated information remains challenging, especially under privacy regulations such as the GDPR. Existing unlearning methods largely optimize for efficiency and scalability, yet they offer little transparency, and the black-box nature of GNNs makes it difficult to verify whether forgetting has truly occurred. We propose an explainability-driven verifier for GNN unlearning that snapshots the model before and after deletion, using attribution shifts and localized structural changes (for example, graph edit distance) as transparent evidence. The verifier uses five explainability metrics: residual attribution, heatmap shift, explainability score deviation, graph edit distance, and a diagnostic graph rule shift. We evaluate two backbones (GCN, GAT) and four unlearning strategies (Retrain, GraphEditor, GNNDelete, IDEA) across five benchmarks (Cora, Citeseer, Pubmed, Coauthor-CS, Coauthor-Physics). Results show that Retrain and GNNDelete achieve near-complete forgetting, GraphEditor provides partial erasure, and IDEA leaves residual signals. These explanation deltas provide the primary, human-readable evidence of forgetting; we also report membership-inference ROC-AUC as a complementary, graph-wide privacy signal.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in WSDM 2026 (ACM International Conference on Web Search and Data Mining).

| **[On the Impact of Graph Neural Networks in Recommender Systems: A Topological Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07384v1)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recommender systems, user-item interactions can be modeled as a bipartite graph, where user and item nodes are connected by undirected edges. This graph-based view has motivated the rapid adoption of graph neural networks (GNNs), which often outperform collaborative filtering (CF) methods such as latent factor models, deep neural networks, and generative strategies. Yet, despite their empirical success, the reasons why GNNs offer systematic advantages over other CF approaches remain only partially understood. This monograph advances a topology-centered perspective on GNN-based recommendation. We argue that a comprehensive understanding of these models' performance should consider the structural properties of user-item graphs and their interaction with GNN architectural design. To support this view, we introduce a formal taxonomy that distills common modeling patterns across eleven representative GNN-based recommendation approaches and consolidates them into a unified conceptual pipeline. We further formalize thirteen classical and topological characteristics of recommendation datasets and reinterpret them through the lens of graph machine learning. Using these definitions, we analyze the considered GNN-based recommender architectures to assess how and to what extent they encode such properties. Building on this analysis, we derive an explanatory framework that links measurable dataset characteristics to model behavior and performance. Taken together, this monograph re-frames GNN-based recommendation through its topological underpinnings and outlines open theoretical, data-centric, and evaluation challenges for the next generation of topology-aware recommender systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards a Relationship-Aware Transformer for Tabular Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07310v1)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning models for tabular data typically do not allow for imposing a graph of external dependencies between samples, which can be useful for accounting for relatedness in tasks such as treatment effect estimation. Graph neural networks only consider adjacent nodes, making them difficult to apply to sparse graphs. This paper proposes several solutions based on a modified attention mechanism, which accounts for possible relationships between data points by adding a term to the attention matrix. Our models are compared with each other and the gradient boosting decision trees in a regression task on synthetic and real-world datasets, as well as in a treatment effect estimation task on the IHDP dataset.</p></details> |  |
| **[Ensembling LLM-Induced Decision Trees for Explainable and Robust Error Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07246v1)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Error detection (ED), which aims to identify incorrect or inconsistent cell values in tabular data, is important for ensuring data quality. Recent state-of-the-art ED methods leverage the pre-trained knowledge and semantic capability embedded in large language models (LLMs) to directly label whether a cell is erroneous. However, this LLM-as-a-labeler pipeline (1) relies on the black box, implicit decision process, thus failing to provide explainability for the detection results, and (2) is highly sensitive to prompts, yielding inconsistent outputs due to inherent model stochasticity, therefore lacking robustness. To address these limitations, we propose an LLM-as-an-inducer framework that adopts LLM to induce the decision tree for ED (termed TreeED) and further ensembles multiple such trees for consensus detection (termed ForestED), thereby improving explainability and robustness. Specifically, based on prompts derived from data context, decision tree specifications and output requirements, TreeED queries the LLM to induce the decision tree skeleton, whose root-to-leaf decision paths specify the stepwise procedure for evaluating a given sample. Each tree contains three types of nodes: (1) rule nodes that perform simple validation checks (e.g., format or range), (2) Graph Neural Network (GNN) nodes that capture complex patterns (e.g., functional dependencies), and (3) leaf nodes that output the final decision types (error or clean). Furthermore, ForestED employs uncertainty-based sampling to obtain multiple row subsets, constructing a decision tree for each subset using TreeED. It then leverages an Expectation-Maximization-based algorithm that jointly estimates tree reliability and optimizes the consensus ED prediction. Extensive xperiments demonstrate that our methods are accurate, explainable and robust, achieving an average F1-score improvement of 16.1% over the best baseline.</p></details> | 14 pages, 8 figures |

We prove that recurrent GNNs with finite-precision parameters, sum aggregation, and ReLU activation, can compute any graph algorithm that respects the natural message-passing invariance induced by the Color Refinement (or Weisfeiler-Leman) algorithm. While it is well known that the expressive power of GNNs is limited by this invariance [Morris et al., AAAI 2019; Xu et al., ICLR 2019], we establish that recurrent GNNs can actually match this limit. This is in contrast to non-recurrent GNNs, which have the power of Weisfeiler-Leman only in a very weak, "non-uniform", sense where each graph size requires a different GNN to compute with. Our construction introduces only a polynomial overhead in both time and space. Furthermore, we show that by incorporating random initialization, for connected graphs recurrent GNNs can express all graph algorithms. In particular, any polynomial-time graph algorithm can be emulated on connected graphs in polynomial time by a recurrent GNN with random initialization.</p></details> |  |
| **[SDT-GNN: Streaming-based Distributed Training Framework for Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02300v2)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, distributed GNN training frameworks, such as DistDGL and PyG, have been developed to enable training GNN models on large graphs by leveraging multiple GPUs in a distributed manner. Despite these advances, their memory requirements are still excessively high, thereby hindering GNN training on large graphs using commodity workstations. In this paper, we propose SDT-GNN, a streaming-based distributed GNN training framework. Unlike the existing frameworks that load the entire graph in memory, it takes a stream of edges as input for graph partitioning to reduce the memory requirement for partitioning. It also enables distributed GNN training even when the aggregated memory size of GPUs is smaller than the size of the graph and feature data. Furthermore, to improve the quality of partitioning, we propose SPRING, a novel streaming partitioning algorithm for distributed GNN training. We demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of SDT-GNN on seven large public datasets. SDT-GNN has up to 95% less memory footprint than DistDGL and PyG without sacrificing the prediction accuracy. SPRING also outperforms state-of-the-art streaming partitioning algorithms significantly.</p></details> | IEEE BigData 2025 |

This underscores the critical need for instance-aware algorithm selection, a domain that remains largely unexplored for the MCP. To address this gap, we propose a novel learning-based framework that integrates both traditional machine learning and graph neural networks. We first construct a benchmark dataset by executing four state-of-the-art exact MCP solvers on a diverse collection of graphs and extracting their structural features. An evaluation of conventional classifiers establishes Random Forest as a strong baseline and reveals that connectivity and topological features are key predictors of performance. Building on these insights, we develop GAT-MLP, a dual-channel model that combines a Graph Attention Network (GAT) to encode local graph structure with a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) to model global features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GAT-MLP achieves superior and consistent performance, significantly outperforming all baseline methods. Our results highlight the effectiveness of the dual-channel architecture and the promise of graph neural networks for combinatorial algorithm selection, achieving 90.43% accuracy in choosing the optimal solver.

| **[Can We Go Beyond Visual Features? Neural Tissue Relation Modeling for Relational Graph Analysis in Non-Melanoma Skin Histology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06949v1)** | 2025-12-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Histopathology image segmentation is essential for delineating tissue structures in skin cancer diagnostics, but modeling spatial context and inter-tissue relationships remains a challenge, especially in regions with overlapping or morphologically similar tissues. Current convolutional neural network (CNN)-based approaches operate primarily on visual texture, often treating tissues as independent regions and failing to encode biological context. To this end, we introduce Neural Tissue Relation Modeling (NTRM), a novel segmentation framework that augments CNNs with a tissue-level graph neural network to model spatial and functional relationships across tissue types. NTRM constructs a graph over predicted regions, propagates contextual information via message passing, and refines segmentation through spatial projection. Unlike prior methods, NTRM explicitly encodes inter-tissue dependencies, enabling structurally coherent predictions in boundary-dense zones. On the benchmark Histopathology Non-Melanoma Skin Cancer Segmentation Dataset, NTRM outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving a robust Dice similarity coefficient that is 4.9\% to 31.25\% higher than the best-performing models among the evaluated approaches. Our experiments indicate that relational modeling offers a principled path toward more context-aware and interpretable histological segmentation, compared to local receptive-field architectures that lack tissue-level structural awareness.

To address this limitation, we propose a generalized family of node similarity measures based on the energy of higher-order feature derivatives. Through a rigorous theoretical analysis of the relationships among these measures, we establish the decay rates of Dirichlet energy under both continuous heat diffusion and discrete aggregation operators. Furthermore, our analysis reveals an intrinsic connection between the over-smoothing decay rate and the spectral gap of the graph Laplacian. Finally, empirical results demonstrate that attention-based Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) suffer from over-smoothing when evaluated under these proposed metrics.</p></details> | 17 pages, 1 figure |
| **[Ensemble Learning of Machine Learning Force Fields](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17507v2)** | 2025-12-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine learning force fields (MLFFs) are a promising approach to balance the accuracy of quantum mechanics with the efficiency of classical potentials, yet selecting an optimal model amid increasingly diverse architectures that delivers reliable force predictions and stable simulations remains a core pratical challenge. Here we introduce EL-MLFFs, an ensemble learning framework that uses a stacking methodology to integrate predictions from diverse base MLFFs. Our approach constructs a graph representation where a graph neural network (GNN) acts as a meta-model to refine the initial force predictions. We present two meta-model architectures: a computationally efficient direct fitting model and a physically-principled conservative model that ensures energy conservation. The framework is evaluated on a diverse range of systems, including single molecules (methane), surface chemistry (methanol/Cu(100)), molecular dynamics benchmarks (MD17), and the MatPES materials dataset. Results show that EL-MLFFs improves predictive accuracy across these domains. For molecular systems, it reduces force errors and improves the simulation stability compared to base models. For materials, the method yields lower formation energy errors on the WBM test set. The EL- MLFFs framework offers a systematic approach to address challenges of model selection and the accuracy-stability trade-off in molecular and materials simulations.</p></details> | 12 pages, 3 figures |

The Orientation-aware Interaction-based Deep Material Network (ODMN) is one such framework, in which a set of material nodes represents crystallographic textures, and a hierarchical interaction network enforces stress equilibrium among these nodes based on the Hill-Mandel condition. Using only linear elastic stiffness data, ODMN learns the intrinsic geometry-mechanics relationships within polycrystalline microstructures, allowing it to predict nonlinear mechanical responses and texture evolution with high fidelity. However, its applicability remains limited by the need to retrain for each distinct crystallographic texture. To address this limitation, we introduce the TACS-GNN-ODMN framework, which integrates (i) a Texture-Adaptive Clustering and Sampling (TACS) scheme for initializing texture-related parameters and (ii) a Graph Neural Network (GNN) for predicting stress-equilibrium-related parameters. The proposed framework accurately predicts nonlinear responses and texture evolution across diverse textures, showing close agreement with direct numerical simulations (DNS). By eliminating the requirement for texture-specific retraining while preserving physical interpretability, TACS-GNN-ODMN substantially enhances the generalization capability of ODMN, offering a robust and efficient surrogate model for multiscale simulations and next-generation materials design.</p></details> |  |

However, their reliance on message passing prevents them from capturing the hierarchical interactions that govern protein function, such as global domains and long-range allosteric regulation. In this work, we argue that the network architecture itself should mirror this biological hierarchy. We introduce Geometric Graph U-Nets, a new class of models that learn multi-scale representations by recursively coarsening and refining the protein graph. We prove that this hierarchical design can theoretically more expressive than standard Geometric GNNs. Empirically, on the task of protein fold classification, Geometric U-Nets substantially outperform invariant and equivariant baselines, demonstrating their ability to learn the global structural patterns that define protein folds. Our work provides a principled foundation for designing geometric deep learning architectures that can learn the multi-scale structure of biomolecules.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at Machine Learning in Structural Biology, 2025.

We show that two of the most commonly used benchmark data sets - GossipCop and PolitiFact - are poorly suited to evaluating the utility of models that use propagation structure. Specifically, these data sets exhibit shallow, ego-like graph topologies that provide little or no ability to differentiate among modeling methods. We systematically benchmark five GNN architectures against a structure-agnostic multilayer perceptron (MLP) that uses the same node features. We show that MLPs match or closely trail the performance of GNNs, with performance gaps often within 1-2% and overlapping confidence intervals. To isolate the contribution of structure in these datasets, we conduct controlled experiments where node features are shuffled or edge structures randomized. We find that performance collapses under feature shuffling but remains stable under edge randomization. This suggests that structure plays a negligible role in these benchmarks. Structural analysis further reveals that over 75% of nodes are only one hop from the root, exhibiting minimal structural diversity. In contrast, on synthetic datasets where node features are noisy and structure is informative, GNNs significantly outperform MLPs. These findings provide strong evidence that widely used benchmarks do not meaningfully test the utility of modeling structural features, and they motivate the development of datasets with richer, more diverse graph topologies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

A Concise Review and Evaluation of Link Prediction Methods](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14711v2)** | 2025-12-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper explores the ability of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in learning various forms of information for link prediction, alongside a brief review of existing link prediction methods. Our analysis reveals that GNNs cannot effectively learn structural information related to the number of common neighbors between two nodes, primarily due to the nature of set-based pooling of the neighborhood aggregation scheme. Also, our extensive experiments indicate that trainable node embeddings can improve the performance of GNN-based link prediction models. Importantly, we observe that the denser the graph, the greater such the improvement. We attribute this to the characteristics of node embeddings, where the link state of each link sample could be encoded into the embeddings of nodes that are involved in the neighborhood aggregation of the two nodes in that link sample. In denser graphs, every node could have more opportunities to attend the neighborhood aggregation of other nodes and encode states of more link samples to its embedding, thus learning better node embeddings for link prediction. Lastly, we demonstrate that the insights gained from our research carry important implications in identifying the limitations of existing link prediction methods, which could guide the future development of more robust algorithms.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exploiting Supply Chain Interdependencies for Stock Return Prediction: A Full-State Graph Convolutional LSTM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.09406v2)** | 2025-12-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Stock return prediction is fundamental to financial decision-making, yet traditional time series models fail to capture the complex interdependencies between companies in modern markets. We propose the Full-State Graph Convolutional LSTM (FS-GCLSTM), a novel temporal graph neural network that incorporates value-chain relationships to enhance stock return forecasting. Our approach features two key innovations: First, we represent inter-firm dependencies through value-chain networks, where nodes correspond to companies and edges capture supplier-customer relationships, enabling the model to leverage information beyond historical price data. Second, FS-GCLSTM applies graph convolutions to all LSTM components - current input features, previous hidden states, and cell states - ensuring that spatial information from the value-chain network influences every aspect of the temporal update mechanism. We evaluate FS-GCLSTM on Eurostoxx 600 and S&P 500 datasets using LSEG value-chain data. While not achieving the lowest traditional prediction errors, FS-GCLSTM consistently delivers superior portfolio performance, attaining the highest annualized returns, Sharpe ratios, and Sortino ratios across both markets. Performance gains are more pronounced in the denser Eurostoxx 600 network, and robustness tests confirm stability across different input sequence lengths, demonstrating the practical value of integrating value-chain data with temporal graph neural networks.</p></details> |  |

Graph neural networks (GNNs) in which messages are passed between nodes that represent atoms that are spatial neighbors promise to obviate manual feature engineering, but the use of GNNs with biomolecular systems of more than a few hundred residues has been limited in the context of analyzing dynamics by both difficulties in capturing the details of long-range interactions with message passing and the memory and runtime requirements associated with large graphs. Here, we show how local information can be aggregated to reduce memory and runtime requirements without sacrificing atomic detail. We demonstrate that this approach opens the door to analyzing simulations of protein-nucleic acid complexes with thousands of residues on single GPUs within minutes. For systems with hundreds of residues, for which there are sufficient data to make quantitative comparisons, we show that the approach improves performance and interpretability.</p></details> | 17 pages, 12 figures |

To tackle this, methods like coarsening, condensation, and computation trees are used to train on a smaller graph, resulting in faster computation. Nonetheless, prior research has not adequately addressed the computational costs during the inference phase. This paper presents a novel approach to improve the scalability of GNNs by reducing computational burden during the inference phase using graph coarsening. We demonstrate two different methods -- Extra Nodes and Cluster Nodes. Our study extends the application of graph coarsening for graph-level tasks, including graph classification and graph regression. We conduct extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets to evaluate the performance of our approach. Our results show that the proposed method achieves orders of magnitude improvements in single-node inference time compared to traditional approaches. Furthermore, it significantly reduces memory consumption for node and graph classification and regression tasks, enabling efficient training and inference on low-resource devices where conventional methods are impractical. Notably, these computational advantages are achieved while maintaining competitive performance relative to baseline models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mind The Gap: Quantifying Mechanistic Gaps in Algorithmic Reasoning via Neural Compilation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18623v2)** | 2025-12-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper aims to understand how neural networks learn algorithmic reasoning by addressing two questions: How faithful are learned algorithms when they are effective, and why do neural networks fail to learn effective algorithms otherwise? To answer these questions, we use neural compilation, a technique that directly encodes a source algorithm into neural network parameters, enabling the network to compute the algorithm exactly. This enables comparison between compiled and conventionally learned parameters, intermediate vectors, and behaviors. This investigation is crucial for developing neural networks that robustly learn complexalgorithms from data. Our analysis focuses on graph neural networks (GNNs), which are naturally aligned with algorithmic reasoning tasks, specifically our choices of BFS, DFS, and Bellman-Ford, which cover the spectrum of effective, faithful, and ineffective learned algorithms. Commonly, learning algorithmic reasoning is framed as induction over synthetic data, where a parameterized model is trained on inputs, traces, and outputs produced by an underlying ground truth algorithm. In contrast, we introduce a neural compilation method for GNNs, which sets network parameters analytically, bypassing training. Focusing on GNNs leverages their alignment with algorithmic reasoning, extensive algorithmic induction literature, and the novel application of neural compilation to GNNs. Overall, this paper aims to characterize expressability-trainability gaps - a fundamental shortcoming in learning algorithmic reasoning. We hypothesize that inductive learning is most effective for parallel algorithms contained within the computational class \texttt{NC}.</p></details> |  |

Feature propagation (FP) is a well-known method that performs well for imputation of missing node features on graphs, but it still has the following three issues: 1) it struggles with graphs that are not fully connected, 2) imputed features face the over-smoothing problem, and 3) FP is tailored for transductive tasks, overlooking the feature distribution shift in inductive tasks. To address these challenges, we introduce DDFI, a Diverse and Distribution-aware Missing Feature Imputation method that combines feature propagation with a graph-based Masked AutoEncoder (MAE) in a nontrivial manner. It first designs a simple yet effective algorithm, namely Co-Label Linking (CLL), that randomly connects nodes in the training set with the same label to enhance the performance on graphs with numerous connected components. Then we develop a novel two-step representation generation process at the inference stage. Specifically, instead of directly using FP-imputed features as input during inference, DDFI further reconstructs the features through the whole MAE to reduce feature distribution shift in the inductive tasks and enhance the diversity of node features. Meanwhile, since existing feature imputation methods for graphs only evaluate by simulating the missing scenes with manually masking the features, we collect a new dataset called Sailing from the records of voyages that contains naturally missing features to help better evaluate the effectiveness. Extensive experiments conducted on six public datasets and Sailing show that DDFI outperforms the state-of-the-art methods under both transductive and inductive settings.</p></details> |  |

This expressive embedding is then processed by a deep reinforcement learning policy network, which generates real-time scheduling decisions optimized for both makespan and carbon emission objectives. To support sustainability goals, \textsc{Luca} incorporates a dual-objective reward function that encourages both energy efficiency and scheduling timeliness. Experimental results on both synthetic and public datasets demonstrate that \textsc{Luca} consistently outperforms comparison algorithms. For instance, on the synthetic dataset, it achieves an average of 4.1\% and up to 12.2\% lower makespan compared to the best-performing comparison algorithm while maintaining the same emission level.

This work proposes a multimodal graph neural network framework that integrates structural MRI, diffusion tensor imaging, and functional MRI to model spatiotemporal brain network reorganization. Brain regions are represented as nodes and structural and functional connectivity as edges, forming longitudinal brain graphs for each subject. Temporal evolution is captured via fractional stochastic differential operators embedded within graph-based recurrent networks, enabling the modeling of long-term dependencies and stochastic fluctuations in network dynamics. Attention mechanisms fuse multimodal information and generate interpretable biomarkers, including network energy entropy, graph curvature, fractional memory indices, and modality-specific attention scores. These biomarkers are combined into a composite prognostic index to quantify individual risk of network instability or cognitive decline. Experiments on longitudinal neuroimaging datasets demonstrate both predictive accuracy and interpretability. The results highlight the potential of mathematically rigorous, multimodal graph-based approaches for deriving clinically meaningful biomarkers from existing imaging data without requiring new data collection.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 2 figures.

Structure domain shifts frequently occur, especially when graph data are collected at different times or from varying areas, resulting in poor performance of GNNs on target graphs. Surprisingly, we find that simply incorporating an auxiliary loss function for denoising graph edges on target graphs can be extremely effective in enhancing GNN performance on target graphs. Based on this insight, we propose our framework, GraphDeT, a framework that integrates this auxiliary edge task into GNN training for node classification under domain adaptation. Our theoretical analysis connects this auxiliary edge task to the graph generalization bound with -distance, demonstrating such auxiliary task can imposes a constraint which tightens the bound and thereby improves generalization. The experimental results demonstrate superior performance compared to the existing baselines in handling both time and regional domain graph shifts.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unlearning Inversion Attacks for Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00808v2)** | 2025-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph unlearning methods aim to efficiently remove the impact of sensitive data from trained GNNs without full retraining, assuming that deleted information cannot be recovered. In this work, we challenge this assumption by introducing the graph unlearning inversion attack: given only black-box access to an unlearned GNN and partial graph knowledge, can an adversary reconstruct the removed edges? We identify two key challenges: varying probability-similarity thresholds for unlearned versus retained edges, and the difficulty of locating unlearned edge endpoints, and address them with TrendAttack. First, we derive and exploit the confidence pitfall, a theoretical and empirical pattern showing that nodes adjacent to unlearned edges exhibit a large drop in model confidence. Second, we design an adaptive prediction mechanism that applies different similarity thresholds to unlearned and other membership edges. Our framework flexibly integrates existing membership inference techniques and extends them with trend features. Experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate that TrendAttack significantly outperforms state-of-the-art GNN membership inference baselines, exposing a critical privacy vulnerability in current graph unlearning methods.</p></details> |  |

Our method applies a successive shortest paths (SSP) algorithm to a tracking graph defined over a batch of frames. The edge costs in this tracking graph are computed via a message-passing network, a graph neural network (GNN) variant. The parameters of the GNN, and hence, the tracker, are learned end-to-end on a training set of example ground-truth tracks and detections. Specifically, learning takes the form of bilevel optimization guided by our novel loss function. We evaluate our algorithm on simulated scenarios to understand its sensitivity to scenario aspects and model hyperparameters. Across varied scenario complexities, our method compares favorably to a strong baseline.</p></details> |  |

While graph neural networks (GNNs) have advanced molecular property prediction, they often rely on molecular topology and neglect the three-dimensional geometric information crucial for modeling transport mechanisms. This paper introduces the geometric multi-color message-passing graph neural network (GMC-MPNN), a novel framework that enhances standard message-passing architectures by explicitly incorporating atomic-level geometric features and long-range interactions. Our model constructs weighted colored subgraphs based on atom types to capture the spatial relationships and chemical context that govern BBB permeability. We evaluated GMC-MPNN on three benchmark datasets for both classification and regression tasks, using rigorous scaffold-based splitting to ensure a robust assessment of generalization. The results demonstrate that GMC-MPNN consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art models, achieving superior performance in both classifying compounds as permeable/non-permeable (AUC-ROC of 0.947 and 0.9212) and in regressing continuous permeability values (RMSE of 0.5628, Pearson correlation of 0.6947). An ablation study further quantified the impact of specific atom-pair interactions, revealing that the model's predictive power derives from its ability to learn from both common and rare, but chemically significant, functional motifs. By integrating spatial geometry into the graph representation, GMC-MPNN sets a new performance benchmark and offers a more accurate and generalizable tool for drug discovery pipelines.</p></details> |  |

Unlike conventional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) that rely on structured feature sequences, TCNs explicitly combine subsets of input features through theoretically grounded multiplicative and pairwise interaction mechanisms to create enriched representations. This feature combination strategy, formalized through polynomial feature expansions, captures high-order feature interactions that traditional convolutional approaches miss. We provide a comprehensive mathematical framework for TCNs, demonstrating how the twisted convolution operation generalizes standard convolutions while maintaining computational tractability. Through extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets from diverse domains (medical diagnostics, political science, synthetic data, chemometrics, and healthcare), we show that TCNs achieve statistically significant improvements over CNNs, Residual Networks (ResNet), Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), DeepSets, and Support Vector Machine (SVM). The performance gains are validated through statistical testing. TCNs also exhibit superior training stability and generalization capabilities, highlighting their robustness for non-spatial data classification tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>The s...</summary><p>The source code for the TCNs can be accessed at https://github.com/junbolian/Twisted-Convolutional-Networks</p></details> |

While frameworks such as PyTorch Geometric (PyG) and Deep Graph Library (DGL) prioritize high-level usability, they fail to address these divergent execution characteristics. As a result, they rely on generic kernels that suffer from poor cache locality, excessive memory movement, and substantial intermediate allocations. To address these limitations, we present Morphling, a domain-specific code synthesizer designed to bridge this gap. Morphling compiles high-level GNN specifications into portable, backend-specialized implementations targeting OpenMP, CUDA, and MPI. It achieves this by instantiating a library of optimized, architecture-aware primitives tailored to each execution environment. Morphling also incorporates a runtime sparsity-aware execution engine that dynamically selects dense or sparse execution paths using input feature statistics, reducing unnecessary computation on zero-valued entries. We evaluate Morphling on eleven real-world datasets spanning diverse graph structures, feature dimensionalities, and sparsity regimes. Morphling improves per-epoch training throughput by an average of 20X on CPUs, 19X on GPUs, and 6X in distributed settings over PyG and DGL, with peak speedups reaching 66X. Morphling's memory-efficient layouts further reduce peak memory consumption by up to 15X, enabling large-scale GNN training on commodity hardware. These findings demonstrate that specialized, architecture-aware code synthesis provides an effective and scalable path toward high-performance GNN execution across diverse parallel and distributed platforms.</p></details> |  |

However, prevalent approaches, particularly Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), heavily rely on constructing explicit user--service interaction graphs. Such reliance not only leads to the intractability of explicit graph construction in large-scale scenarios but also limits the modeling of implicit topological relationships and exacerbates susceptibility to environmental noise and outliers. To address these challenges, this paper introduces \emph{QoSDiff}, a novel embedding learning framework that bypasses the prerequisite of explicit graph construction. Specifically, it leverages a denoising diffusion probabilistic model to recover intrinsic latent structures from noisy initializations. To further capture high-order interactions, we propose an adversarial interaction module that integrates a bidirectional hybrid attention mechanism. This adversarial paradigm dynamically distinguishes informative patterns from noise, enabling a dual-perspective modeling of intricate user--service associations. Extensive experiments on two large-scale real-world datasets demonstrate that QoSDiff significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. Notably, the results highlight the framework's superior cross-dataset generalization capability and exceptional robustness against observational noise.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint submitted to IEEE Transactions on Services Computing</p></details> |

These aberrations arise from distortions in the optical wavefront and can be mathematically represented using Zernike polynomials. Existing methods often address only mild aberrations on limited sample types and modalities, typically treating the problem as a black-box mapping without leveraging the underlying optical physics of wavefront distortions. We propose ZRNet, a physics-informed framework that jointly performs Zernike coefficient prediction and optical image Restoration. We contribute a Zernike Graph module that explicitly models physical relationships between Zernike polynomials based on their azimuthal degrees-ensuring that learned corrections align with fundamental optical principles. To further enforce physical consistency between image restoration and Zernike prediction, we introduce a Frequency-Aware Alignment (FAA) loss, which better aligns Zernike coefficient prediction and image features in the Fourier domain. Extensive experiments on CytoImageNet demonstrates that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in both image restoration and Zernike coefficient prediction across diverse microscopy modalities and biological samples with complex, large-amplitude aberrations.

While recent works have leveraged graph neural networks for network intrusion detection, they often decouple representation learning from anomaly detection, limiting the utility of the embeddings for identifying attacks. We propose GraphIDS, a self-supervised intrusion detection model that unifies these two stages by learning local graph representations of normal communication patterns through a masked autoencoder. An inductive graph neural network embeds each flow with its local topological context to capture typical network behavior, while a Transformer-based encoder-decoder reconstructs these embeddings, implicitly learning global co-occurrence patterns via self-attention without requiring explicit positional information. During inference, flows with unusually high reconstruction errors are flagged as potential intrusions. This end-to-end framework ensures that embeddings are directly optimized for the downstream task, facilitating the recognition of malicious traffic. On diverse NetFlow benchmarks, GraphIDS achieves up to 99.98% PR-AUC and 99.61% macro F1-score, outperforming baselines by 5-25 percentage points.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[Bounded Graph Clustering with Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05623v1)** | 2025-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In community detection, many methods require the user to specify the number of clusters in advance since an exhaustive search over all possible values is computationally infeasible. While some classical algorithms can infer this number directly from the data, this is typically not the case for graph neural networks (GNNs): even when a desired number of clusters is specified, standard GNN-based methods often fail to return the exact number due to the way they are designed. In this work, we address this limitation by introducing a flexible and principled way to control the number of communities discovered by GNNs. Rather than assuming the true number of clusters is known, we propose a framework that allows the user to specify a plausible range and enforce these bounds during training. However, if the user wants an exact number of clusters, it may also be specified and reliably returned.</p></details> | 17 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Beyond the Laplacian: Interpolated Spectral Augmentation for Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11928v2)** | 2025-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) are fundamental tools in graph machine learning. The performance of GNNs relies crucially on the availability of informative node features, which can be limited or absent in real-life datasets and applications. A natural remedy is to augment the node features with embeddings computed from eigenvectors of the graph Laplacian matrix. While it is natural to default to Laplacian spectral embeddings, which capture meaningful graph connectivity information, we ask whether spectral embeddings from alternative graph matrices can also provide useful representations for learning. We introduce Interpolated Laplacian Embeddings (ILEs), which are derived from a simple yet expressive family of graph matrices. Using tools from spectral graph theory, we offer a straightforward interpretation of the structural information that ILEs capture. We demonstrate through simulations and experiments on real-world datasets that feature augmentation via ILEs can improve performance across commonly used GNN architectures. Our work offers a straightforward and practical approach that broadens the practitioner's spectral augmentation toolkit when node features are limited.</p></details> |  |

The recent integration of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) has further enhanced prediction accuracy in contemporary social recommendation algorithms. However, many GNN-based approaches in social recommendation lack the ability to furnish meaningful explanations for their predictions. In this study, we confront this challenge by introducing SoREX, a self-explanatory GNN-based social recommendation framework. SoREX adopts a two-tower framework enhanced by friend recommendation, independently modeling social relations and user-item interactions, while jointly optimizing an auxiliary task to reinforce social signals. To offer explanations, we propose a novel ego-path extraction approach. This method involves transforming the ego-net of a target user into a collection of multi-hop ego-paths, from which we extract factor-specific and candidate-aware ego-path subsets as explanations. This process facilitates the summarization of detailed comparative explanations among different candidate items through intricate substructure analysis. Furthermore, we conduct explanation re-aggregation to explicitly correlate explanations with downstream predictions, imbuing our framework with inherent self-explainability. Comprehensive experiments conducted on four widely adopted benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of SoREX in predictive accuracy. Additionally, qualitative and quantitative analyses confirm the efficacy of the extracted explanations in SoREX.

| **[Beyond Detection: A Comprehensive Benchmark and Study on Representation Learning for Fine-Grained Webshell Family Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05288v1)** | 2025-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Malicious WebShells pose a significant and evolving threat by compromising critical digital infrastructures and endangering public services in sectors such as healthcare and finance. While the research community has made significant progress in WebShell detection (i.e., distinguishing malicious samples from benign ones), we argue that it is time to transition from passive detection to in-depth analysis and proactive defense. One promising direction is the automation of WebShell family classification, which involves identifying the specific malware lineage in order to understand an adversary's tactics and enable a precise, rapid response. This crucial task, however, remains a largely unexplored area that currently relies on slow, manual expert analysis. To address this gap, we present the first systematic study to automate WebShell family classification. Our method begins with extracting dynamic function call traces to capture inherent behaviors that are resistant to common encryption and obfuscation. To enhance the scale and diversity of our dataset for a more stable evaluation, we augment these real-world traces with new variants synthesized by Large Language Models. These augmented traces are then abstracted into sequences, graphs, and trees, providing a foundation to benchmark a comprehensive suite of representation methods. Our evaluation spans classic sequence-based embeddings (CBOW, GloVe), transformers (BERT, SimCSE), and a range of structure-aware algorithms, including Graph Kernels, Graph Edit Distance, Graph2Vec, and various Graph Neural Networks. Through extensive experiments on four real-world, family-annotated datasets under both supervised and unsupervised settings, we establish a robust baseline and provide practical insights into the most effective combinations of data abstractions, representation models, and learning paradigms for this challenge.</p></details> |  |

However, traditional wet lab experiments are limited by efficiency and cost constraints, making it difficult to extensively explore potential associations between developed drugs and target miRNAs. Therefore, we have designed a novel machine learning model based on a multi-layer transformer-based graph neural network, DMAGT, specifically for predicting associations between drugs and miRNAs. This model transforms drug-miRNA associations into graphs, employs Word2Vec for embedding features of drug molecular structures and miRNA base structures, and leverages a graph transformer model to learn from embedded features and relational structures, ultimately predicting associations between drugs and miRNAs. To evaluate DMAGT, we tested its performance on three datasets composed of drug-miRNA associations: ncDR, RNAInter, and SM2miR, achieving up to AUC of $95.24\pm0.05$. DMAGT demonstrated superior performance in comparative experiments tackling similar challenges. To validate its practical efficacy, we specifically focused on two drugs, namely 5-Fluorouracil and Oxaliplatin. Of the 20 potential drug-miRNA associations identified as the most likely, 14 were successfully validated. The above experiments demonstrate that DMAGT has an excellent performance and stability in predicting drug-miRNA associations, providing a new shortcut for miRNA drug development.</p></details> | 9 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Towards a Generalisable Cyber Defence Agent for Real-World Computer Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09114v2)** | 2025-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in deep reinforcement learning for autonomous cyber defence have resulted in agents that can successfully defend simulated computer networks against cyber-attacks. However, many of these agents would need retraining to defend networks with differing topology or size, making them poorly suited to real-world networks where topology and size can vary over time. In this research we introduce a novel set of Topological Extensions for Reinforcement Learning Agents (TERLA) that provide generalisability for the defence of networks with differing topology and size, without the need for retraining. Our approach involves the use of heterogeneous graph neural network layers to produce a fixed-size latent embedding representing the observed network state. This representation learning stage is coupled with a reduced, fixed-size, semantically meaningful and interpretable action space. We apply TERLA to a standard deep reinforcement learning Proximal Policy Optimisation (PPO) agent model, and to reduce the sim-to-real gap, conduct our research using Cyber Autonomy Gym for Experimentation (CAGE) Challenge 4. This Cyber Operations Research Gym environment has many of the features of a real-world network, such as realistic Intrusion Detection System (IDS) events and multiple agents defending network segments of differing topology and size. TERLA agents retain the defensive performance of vanilla PPO agents whilst showing improved action efficiency. Generalisability has been demonstrated by showing that all TERLA agents have the same network-agnostic neural network architecture, and by deploying a single TERLA agent multiple times to defend network segments with differing topology and size, showing improved defensive performance and efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in Proceedings of the 2025 Conference on Applied Machine Learning for Information Security: https://proceedings.mlr.press/v299/dudman25a.html</p></details> |

This paper designs the optimal task offloading policy to address the concerns involving processing delay, energy consumption and edge computing cost. Each computation task consisting of some interdependent sub-tasks is characterized as a directed acyclic graph (DAG). In such dynamic networks, a novel hierarchical Offloading scheme is proposed by leveraging deep reinforcement learning (DRL). The inter-dependencies among the DAGs of the computation tasks are extracted using a graph neural network with attention mechanism. A parameterized DRL algorithm is developed to deal with the hierarchical action space containing both discrete and continuous actions. Simulation results with a real-world car speed dataset demonstrate that the proposed scheme can effectively reduce the system overhead.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work will not be further developed or submitted for publication, so we withdraw the manuscript from arXiv</p></details> |

Similar to the propagation-aggregation methodology, the Weisfeiler-Lehman (1-WL) algorithm tests isomorphism through color refinement according to color representations of a node and its neighbor nodes. However, 1-WL does not leverage any edge features (labels), presenting a potential improvement on exploiting edge features in some fields. To address this limitation, we proposed a novel Edged-WL algorithm (E-WL) which extends the original 1-WL algorithm to incorporate edge features. Building upon the E-WL algorithm, we also introduce an Edged Graph Isomorphism Network (EGIN) model for further exploiting edge features, which addresses one key drawback in many GNNs that do not utilize any edge features of graph data. We evaluated the performance of proposed models using 12 edge-featured benchmark graph datasets and compared them with some state-of-the-art baseline models. Experimental results indicate that our proposed EGIN models, in general, demonstrate superior performance in graph learning on graph classification tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Autho...</summary><p>Author's Accepted Manuscript (AAM) of ICANN 2024 paper published in LNCS (Springer).

| **[Improving Graph Neural Network Training, Defense, and Hypergraph Partitioning via Adversarial Robustness Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14738v7)** | 2025-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are a highly effective neural network architecture for processing graph-structured data. Unlike traditional neural networks that rely solely on the features of the data as input, GNNs leverage both the graph structure, which represents the relationships between data points, and the feature matrix of the data to optimize their feature representation. This unique capability enables GNNs to achieve superior performance across various tasks. However, it also makes GNNs more susceptible to noise from both the graph structure and data features, which can significantly increase the training difficulty and degrade their performance. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel method for selecting noise-sensitive training samples from the original training set to construct a smaller yet more effective training set for model training. These samples are used to help improve the model's ability to correctly process data in noisy environments. We have evaluated our approach on three of the most classical GNN models GCN, GAT, and GraphSAGE as well as three widely used benchmark datasets: Cora, Citeseer, and PubMed. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can substantially boost the training of Graph Neural Networks compared to using randomly sampled training sets of the same size from the original training set and the larger original full training set. We further proposed a robust-node based hypergraph partitioning method, an adversarial robustness based graph pruning method for GNN defenses and a related spectral edge attack method.</p></details> |  |

While existing graph condensation techniques have shown promise in addressing these issues, they are predominantly designed for single-label datasets, where each node is associated with a single class label. However, many real-world applications, such as social network analysis and bioinformatics, involve multi-label graph datasets, where one node can have various related labels. To deal with this problem, we extends traditional graph condensation approaches to accommodate multi-label datasets by introducing modifications to synthetic dataset initialization and condensing optimization. Through experiments on eight real-world multi-label graph datasets, we prove the effectiveness of our method. In experiment, the GCond framework, combined with K-Center initialization and binary cross-entropy loss (BCELoss), achieves best performance in general. This benchmark for multi-label graph condensation not only enhances the scalability and efficiency of GNNs for multi-label graph data, but also offering substantial benefits for diverse real-world applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Transactions on Machine Learning Research (TMLR)</p></details> |

Accurate and timely inference of supply chain resilience the capability to maintain core functions during disruptions is crucial for proactive risk mitigation and robust network design. However, existing approaches lack effective mechanisms to infer supply chain resilience without explicit system dynamics and struggle to represent the higher-order, multi-entity dependencies inherent in supply chain networks. These limitations motivate the definition of a novel problem and the development of targeted modeling solutions. To address these challenges, we formalize a novel problem: Supply Chain Resilience Inference (SCRI), defined as predicting supply chain resilience using hypergraph topology and observed inventory trajectories without explicit dynamic equations. To solve this problem, we propose the Supply Chain Resilience Inference Hypergraph Network (SC-RIHN), a novel hypergraph-based model leveraging set-based encoding and hypergraph message passing to capture multi-party firm-product interactions. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that SC-RIHN significantly outperforms traditional MLP, representative graph neural network variants, and ResInf baselines across synthetic benchmarks, underscoring its potential for practical, early-warning risk assessment in complex supply chain systems.</p></details> |  |

Graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown strong performance for this problem, but costly graph construction, irregular computations, and random memory access patterns substantially limit their throughput. The recently proposed Hashing-based Efficient Point Transformer (HEPT) offers a theoretically guaranteed near-linear complexity for large point cloud processing via locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) in attention computations; however, its evaluations have largely focused on embedding quality, and the object condensation pipeline on which HEPT relies requires a post-hoc clustering step (e.g., DBScan) that can dominate runtime. In this work, we make two contributions. First, we present a unified, fair evaluation of physics tracking performance for HEPT and a representative GNN-based pipeline under the same dataset and metrics. Second, we introduce HEPTv2 by extending HEPT with a lightweight decoder that eliminates the clustering stage and directly predicts track assignments. This modification preserves HEPT's regular, hardware-friendly computations while enabling ultra-fast end-to-end inference. On the TrackML dataset, optimized HEPTv2 achieves approximately 28 ms per event on an A100 while maintaining competitive tracking efficiency. These results position HEPTv2 as a practical, scalable alternative to GNN-based pipelines for fast tracking.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2025 Machine Learning and the Physical Sciences Workshop</p></details> |

By integrating quantum embedding, variational graph convolutions, and topological data analysis, QTGNN captures complex transaction dynamics and structural anomalies indicative of fraud. The methodology includes quantum data embedding with entanglement enhancement, variational quantum graph convolutions with non-linear dynamics, extraction of higher-order topological invariants, hybrid quantum-classical anomaly learning with adaptive optimization, and interpretable decision-making via topological attribution. Rigorous convergence guarantees ensure stable training on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices, while stability of topological signatures provides robust fraud detection. Optimized for NISQ hardware with circuit simplifications and graph sampling, the framework scales to large transaction networks. Simulations on financial datasets, such as PaySim and Elliptic, benchmark QTGNN against classical and quantum baselines, using metrics like ROC-AUC, precision, and false positive rate. An ablation study evaluates the contributions of quantum embeddings, topological features, non-linear channels, and hybrid learning.

As a prominent example, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) projects data points onto the eigenvectors of their covariance matrix, capturing the directions of maximum variance. This mapping, however, falls short in two directions: it fails to capture information in low-variance directions, relevant when, e.g., the data contains high-variance noise; and it provides unstable results in low-sample regimes, especially when covariance eigenvalues are close. CoVariance Neural Networks (VNNs), i.e., graph neural networks using the covariance matrix as a graph, show improved stability to estimation errors and learn more expressive functions in the covariance spectrum than PCA, but require training and operate in a labeled setup. To get the benefits of both worlds, we propose Covariance Scattering Transforms (CSTs), deep untrained networks that sequentially apply filters localized in the covariance spectrum to the input data and produce expressive hierarchical representations via nonlinearities. We define the filters as covariance wavelets that capture specific and detailed covariance spectral patterns. We improve CSTs' computational and memory efficiency via a pruning mechanism, and we prove that their error due to finite-sample covariance estimations is less sensitive to close covariance eigenvalues compared to PCA, improving their stability. Our experiments on age prediction from cortical thickness measurements on 4 datasets collecting patients with neurodegenerative diseases show that CSTs produce stable representations in low-data settings, as VNNs but without any training, and lead to comparable or better predictions w.r.t. more complex learning models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Comparative algorithm performance evaluation and prediction for the maximum clique problem using instance space analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03419v1)** | 2025-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The maximum clique problem, a well-known graph-based combinatorial optimization problem, has been addressed through various algorithmic approaches, though systematic analyses of the problem instances remain sparse. This study employs the instance space analysis (ISA) methodology to systematically analyze the instance space of this problem and assess & predict the performance of state-of-the-art (SOTA) algorithms, including exact, heuristic, and graph neural network (GNN)-based methods. A dataset was compiled using graph instances from TWITTER, COLLAB and IMDB-BINARY benchmarks commonly used in graph machine learning research. A set of 33 generic and 2 problem-specific polynomial-time-computable graph-based features, including several spectral properties, was employed for the ISA. A composite performance mea- sure incorporating both solution quality and algorithm runtime was utilized. The comparative analysis demonstrated that the exact algorithm Mixed Order Maximum Clique (MOMC) exhib- ited superior performance across approximately 74.7% of the instance space constituted by the compiled dataset. Gurobi & CliSAT accounted for superior performance in 13.8% and 11% of the instance space, respectively. The ISA-based algorithm performance prediction model run on 34 challenging test instances compiled from the BHOSLIB and DIMACS datasets yielded top-1 and top-2 best performing algorithm prediction accuracies of 88% and 97%, respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[GAMA: A Neural Neighborhood Search Method with Graph-aware Multi-modal Attention for Vehicle Routing Problem](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07850v2)** | 2025-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in neural neighborhood search methods have shown potential in tackling Vehicle Routing Problems (VRPs). However, most existing approaches rely on simplistic state representations and fuse heterogeneous information via naive concatenation, limiting their ability to capture rich structural and semantic context. To address these limitations, we propose GAMA, a neural neighborhood search method with Graph-aware Multi-modal Attention model in VRP. GAMA encodes the problem instance and its evolving solution as distinct modalities using graph neural networks, and models their intra- and inter-modal interactions through stacked self- and cross-attention layers. A gated fusion mechanism further integrates the multi-modal representations into a structured state, enabling the policy to make informed and generalizable operator selection decisions. Extensive experiments conducted across various synthetic and benchmark instances demonstrate that the proposed algorithm GAMA significantly outperforms the recent neural baselines. Further ablation studies confirm that both the multi-modal attention mechanism and the gated fusion design play a key role in achieving the observed performance gains.</p></details> |  |
| **[VS-Graph: Scalable and Efficient Graph Classification Using Hyperdimensional Computing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03394v1)** | 2025-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph classification is a fundamental task in domains ranging from molecular property prediction to materials design. While graph neural networks (GNNs) achieve strong performance by learning expressive representations via message passing, they incur high computational costs, limiting their scalability and deployment on resource-constrained devices. Hyperdimensional Computing (HDC), also known as Vector Symbolic Architectures (VSA), offers a lightweight, brain-inspired alternative, yet existing HDC-based graph methods typically struggle to match the predictive performance of GNNs. In this work, we propose VS-Graph, a vector-symbolic graph learning framework that narrows the gap between the efficiency of HDC and the expressive power of message passing. VS-Graph introduces a Spike Diffusion mechanism for topology-driven node identification and an Associative Message Passing scheme for multi-hop neighborhood aggregation entirely within the high-dimensional vector space. Without gradient-based optimization or backpropagation, our method achieves competitive accuracy with modern GNNs, outperforming the prior HDC baseline by 4-5% on standard benchmarks such as MUTAG and DD. It also matches or exceeds the performance of the GNN baselines on several datasets while accelerating the training by a factor of up to 450x. Furthermore, VS-Graph maintains high accuracy even with the hypervector dimensionality reduced to D=128, demonstrating robustness under aggressive dimension compression and paving the way for ultra-efficient execution on edge and neuromorphic hardware.</p></details> |  |

In this article, we address task scheduling for lifelong Multi-Agent Pickup-and-Delivery (MAPD) and propose a hybrid method that couples learning-based global guidance with lightweight optimization. A graph neural network policy trained via reinforcement learning outputs a desired distribution of free agents over an aggregated warehouse graph. This signal is converted into region-to-region rebalancing through a minimum-cost flow, and finalized by small, local assignment problems, preserving accuracy while keeping per-step latency within a 1 s compute budget. On congested warehouse benchmarks from the League of Robot Runners (LRR) with up to 500 agents, our approach improves throughput by up to 10% over the 2024 winning scheduler while maintaining real-time execution. The results indicate that coupling graph-structured learned guidance with tractable solvers reduces congestion and yields a practical, scalable blueprint for high-throughput scheduling in large fleets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Multimodal Embeddings for Traffic Accident Prediction and Causal Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02920v1)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider analyzing traffic accident patterns using both road network data and satellite images aligned to road graph nodes. Previous work for predicting accident occurrences relies primarily on road network structural features while overlooking physical and environmental information from the road surface and its surroundings. In this work, we construct a large multimodal dataset across six U.S. states, containing nine million traffic accident records from official sources, and one million high-resolution satellite images for each node of the road network. Additionally, every node is annotated with features such as the region's weather statistics and road type (e.g., residential vs. motorway), and each edge is annotated with traffic volume information (i.e., Average Annual Daily Traffic). Utilizing this dataset, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of multimodal learning methods that integrate both visual and network embeddings. Our findings show that integrating both data modalities improves prediction accuracy, achieving an average AUROC of $90.1\%$, which is a $3.7\%$ gain over graph neural network models that only utilize graph structures. With the improved embeddings, we conduct a causal analysis based on a matching estimator to estimate the key contributing factors influencing traffic accidents. We find that accident rates rise by $24\%$ under higher precipitation, by $22\%$ on higher-speed roads such as motorways, and by $29\%$ due to seasonal patterns, after adjusting for other confounding factors. Ablation studies confirm that satellite imagery features are essential for achieving accurate prediction.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages.

We introduce GraphMatch, a new large-scale recommendation framework that fuses pre-trained language models with graph neural networks to overcome these challenges. Unlike prior approaches centered on standalone models, GraphMatch is a comprehensive recipe built on powerful text encoders and GNNs working in tandem. It employs adversarial negative sampling alongside point-in-time subgraph training to learn representations that capture both the fine-grained semantics of evolving text and the time-sensitive structure of the graph. We evaluated extensively on interaction data from Upwork, a leading labor marketplace, at large scale, and discuss our approach towards low-latency inference suitable for real-time use. In our experiments, GraphMatch outperforms language-only and graph-only baselines on matching tasks while being efficient at runtime. These results demonstrate that unifying language and graph representations yields a highly effective solution to text-rich, dynamic two-sided recommendations, bridging the gap between powerful pretrained LMs and large-scale graphs in practice.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-View Graph Learning with Graph-Tuple](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10341v4)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) typically scale with the number of graph edges, making them well suited for sparse graphs but less efficient on dense graphs, such as point clouds or molecular interactions. A common remedy is to sparsify the graph via similarity thresholding or distance pruning, but this forces an arbitrary choice of a single interaction scale and discards crucial information from other scales. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a multi-view graph-tuple framework. Instead of a single graph, our graph-tuple framework partitions the graph into disjoint subgraphs, capturing primary local interactions and weaker, long-range connections. We then learn multi-view representations from the graph-tuple via a heterogeneous message-passing architecture inspired by the theory of non-commuting operators, which we formally prove is strictly more expressive and guarantees a lower oracle risk compared to single-graph message-passing models. We instantiate our framework on two scientific domains: molecular property prediction from feature-scarce Coulomb matrices and cosmological parameter inference from geometric point clouds. On both applications, our multi-view graph-tuple models demonstrate better performance than single-graph baselines, highlighting the power and versatility of our multi-view approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as a poster at the TAG-DS 2025 Workshop (Topology, Algebra, and Geometry in Data Science).

| **[Credal Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02722v1)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Uncertainty quantification is essential for deploying reliable Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), where existing approaches primarily rely on Bayesian inference or ensembles. In this paper, we introduce the first credal graph neural networks (CGNNs), which extend credal learning to the graph domain by training GNNs to output set-valued predictions in the form of credal sets. To account for the distinctive nature of message passing in GNNs, we develop a complementary approach to credal learning that leverages different aspects of layer-wise information propagation. We assess our approach on uncertainty quantification in node classification under out-of-distribution conditions. Our analysis highlights the critical role of the graph homophily assumption in shaping the effectiveness of uncertainty estimates. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CGNNs deliver more reliable representations of epistemic uncertainty and achieve state-of-the-art performance under distributional shift on heterophilic graphs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Zero-Shot Instruction Following in RL via Structured LTL Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02633v1)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Linear temporal logic (LTL) is a compelling framework for specifying complex, structured tasks for reinforcement learning (RL) agents. Recent work has shown that interpreting LTL instructions as finite automata, which can be seen as high-level programs monitoring task progress, enables learning a single generalist policy capable of executing arbitrary instructions at test time. However, existing approaches fall short in environments where multiple high-level events (i.e., atomic propositions) can be true at the same time and potentially interact in complicated ways. In this work, we propose a novel approach to learning a multi-task policy for following arbitrary LTL instructions that addresses this shortcoming. Our method conditions the policy on sequences of simple Boolean formulae, which directly align with transitions in the automaton, and are encoded via a graph neural network (GNN) to yield structured task representations. Experiments in a complex chess-based environment demonstrate the advantages of our approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICML ...</summary><p>ICML 2025 Workshop on Programmatic Representations for Agent Learning</p></details> |

In this study, we propose a novel approach leveraging Temporal Graph Neural Network (Temporal GNN) to predict solar PV output power and detect anomalies using environmental and operational parameters. The proposed model utilizes graph-based temporal relationships among key PV system parameters, including irradiance, module and ambient temperature to predict electrical power output. This study is based on data collected from an outdoor facility located on a rooftop in Lyon (France) including power measurements from a PV module and meteorological parameters.</p></details> |  |

Notably, a new form of money laundering on stablecoins -- we refer to as crowdsourcing laundering -- disperses funds through recruiting a large number of ordinary individuals, and has rapidly emerged as a significant threat. However, due to the refined division of labor, crowdsourcing laundering transactions exhibit diverse patterns and a polycentric structure, posing significant challenges for detection. In this paper, we introduce transaction group as auxiliary information, and propose the Multi-Task Collaborative Crowdsourcing Laundering Detection (MCCLD) framework. MCCLD employs an end-to-end graph neural network to realize collaboration between laundering transaction detection and transaction group detection tasks, enhancing detection performance on diverse patterns within crowdsourcing laundering group. These two tasks are jointly optimized through a shared classifier, with a shared feature encoder that fuses multi-level feature embeddings to provide rich transaction semantics and potential group information. Extensive experiments on both crowdsourcing and general laundering demonstrate MCCLD's effectiveness and generalization. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work on crowdsourcing laundering detection.</p></details> |  |
| **[Implicit Hypergraph Neural Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14101v2)** | 2025-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hypergraphs offer a generalized framework for capturing high-order relationships between entities and have been widely applied in various domains, including healthcare, social networks, and bioinformatics. Hypergraph neural networks, which rely on message-passing between nodes over hyperedges to learn latent representations, have emerged as the method of choice for predictive tasks in many of these domains. These approaches typically perform only a small number of message-passing rounds to learn the representations, which they then utilize for predictions. The small number of message-passing rounds comes at a cost, as the representations only capture local information and forego long-range high-order dependencies. However, as we demonstrate, blindly increasing the message-passing rounds to capture long-range dependency also degrades the performance of hyper-graph neural networks. Recent works have demonstrated that implicit graph neural networks capture long-range dependencies in standard graphs while maintaining performance. Despite their popularity, prior work has not studied long-range dependency issues on hypergraph neural networks. Here, we first demonstrate that existing hypergraph neural networks lose predictive power when aggregating more information to capture long-range dependency. We then propose Implicit Hypergraph Neural Network (IHNN), a novel framework that jointly learns fixed-point representations for both nodes and hyperedges in an end-to-end manner to alleviate this issue. Leveraging implicit differentiation, we introduce a tractable projected gradient descent approach to train the model efficiently. Extensive experiments on real-world hypergraphs for node classification demonstrate that IHNN outperforms the closest prior works in most settings, establishing a new state-of-the-art in hypergraph learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IEEE BigData 2025</p></details> |

While Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) effectively capture local structural patterns, they often overlook global topological features that are critical for robust representation learning. In this work, we propose GraphTCL, a dual-view contrastive learning framework that integrates structural embeddings from GNNs with topological embeddings derived from persistent homology. By aligning these complementary views through a cross-view contrastive loss, our method enhances representation quality and improves classification performance. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, including TU and OGB molecular graphs, demonstrate that GraphTCL consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. This study highlights the importance of topology-aware contrastive learning for advancing graph representation methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Domain-Decomposed Graph Neural Network Surrogate Modeling for Ice Sheets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01888v1)** | 2025-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate yet efficient surrogate models are essential for large-scale simulations of partial differential equations (PDEs), particularly for uncertainty quantification (UQ) tasks that demand hundreds or thousands of evaluations. We develop a physics-inspired graph neural network (GNN) surrogate that operates directly on unstructured meshes and leverages the flexibility of graph attention. To improve both training efficiency and generalization properties of the model, we introduce a domain decomposition (DD) strategy that partitions the mesh into subdomains, trains local GNN surrogates in parallel, and aggregates their predictions. We then employ transfer learning to fine-tune models across subdomains, accelerating training and improving accuracy in data-limited settings. Applied to ice sheet simulations, our approach accurately predicts full-field velocities on high-resolution meshes, substantially reduces training time relative to training a single global surrogate model, and provides a ripe foundation for UQ objectives. Our results demonstrate that graph-based DD, combined with transfer learning, provides a scalable and reliable pathway for training GNN surrogates on massive PDE-governed systems, with broad potential for application beyond ice sheet dynamics.</p></details> |  |

Entities that are close in graph distance will have lower surprise than those farther apart. This connects the Free Energy Principle (FEP) from neuroscience to KG systems, where the KG serves as the agent's generative model. We formalize surprise using the shortest-path distance in directed graphs and provide a framework for KG-based agents. Graph distance appears in graph neural networks as message passing depth and in model-based reinforcement learning as world model trajectories. This work-in-progress study explores whether distance-based surprise can extend recent work showing that syntax minimizes surprise and free energy via tree structures.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NORA Workshop at NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

While Shapley value-based methods offer mathematically principled explanations by quantifying each component's contribution to predictions, computing exact values requires evaluating $2^n$ coalitions (or aggregating over $n!$ permutations), which is intractable for real-world graphs. Existing approximation strategies sacrifice either fidelity or efficiency, limiting their practical utility. We introduce QGShap, a quantum computing approach that leverages amplitude amplification to achieve quadratic speedups in coalition evaluation while maintaining exact Shapley computation. Unlike classical sampling or surrogate methods, our approach provides fully faithful explanations without approximation trade-offs for tractable graph sizes. We conduct empirical evaluations on synthetic graph datasets, demonstrating that QGShap achieves consistently high fidelity and explanation accuracy, matching or exceeding the performance of classical methods across all evaluation metrics. These results collectively demonstrate that QGShap not only preserves exact Shapley faithfulness but also delivers interpretable, stable, and structurally consistent explanations that align with the underlying graph reasoning of GNNs. The implementation of QGShap is available at https://github.com/smlab-niser/qgshap.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in the QC+AI Workshop at AAAI 2026</p></details> |

The study aims to validate the use of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for extracting structural feature embeddings from MILP instances, using the air05 crew scheduling problem. The MILP instance was transformed into a heterogeneous bipartite graph to model relationships between variables and constraints. Two neural architectures, Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) and Graph Attention Networks (GAT) were trained to generate node embeddings. These representations were evaluated using Instance Space Analysis (ISA) through linear (PCA) and non-linear (UMAP, t-SNE) dimensionality reduction techniques. Analysis revealed that PCA failed to distinguish cluster structures, necessitating non-linear reductions to visualize the embedding topology. The GCN architecture demonstrated superior performance, capturing global topology with well-defined clusters for both variables and constraints. In contrast, the GAT model failed to organize the constraint space. The findings confirm that simpler graph architectures can effectively map the sparse topology of aviation logistics problems without manual feature engineering, contributing to explainability of instance complexity. This structural awareness provides a validated foundation for developing future Learning to Optimize (L2O) agents capable of improving solver performance in safety-critical environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 6 figures, presented at XXII SITRAER 2025, in processes for submission to JATM</p></details> |

| **[Adaptive Canonicalization with Application to Invariant Anisotropic Geometric Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24886v2)** | 2025-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Canonicalization is a widely used strategy in equivariant machine learning, enforcing symmetry in neural networks by mapping each input to a standard form. Yet, it often introduces discontinuities that can affect stability during training, limit generalization, and complicate universal approximation theorems. In this paper, we address this by introducing adaptive canonicalization, a general framework in which the canonicalization depends both on the input and the network. Specifically, we present the adaptive canonicalization based on prior maximization, where the standard form of the input is chosen to maximize the predictive confidence of the network. We prove that this construction yields continuous and symmetry-respecting models that admit universal approximation properties. We propose two applications of our setting: (i) resolving eigenbasis ambiguities in spectral graph neural networks, and (ii) handling rotational symmetries in point clouds. We empirically validate our methods on molecular and protein classification, as well as point cloud classification tasks. Our adaptive canonicalization outperforms the three other common solutions to equivariant machine learning: data augmentation, standard canonicalization, and equivariant architectures.</p></details> |  |

Consequently, Persistent Homology (PH) methods are increasingly employed for graph representation learning. In this context, recent works have proposed decorating classical PH diagrams with vertex and edge features for improved expressivity. However, these methods still fail to capture basic graph structural information. In this paper, we propose SpectRe -- a new topological descriptor for graphs that integrates spectral information into PH diagrams. Notably, SpectRe is strictly more expressive than existing descriptors on graphs. We also introduce notions of global and local stability to analyze existing descriptors and establish that SpectRe is locally stable. Finally, experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of SpectRe and its potential to enhance the capabilities of graph models in relevant learning tasks.

Although 3D volumes contain richer information than individual slices, effective 3D classification remains difficult: volumetric data encode complex spatial dependencies, and the scarcity of large-scale 3D datasets has constrained progress toward 3D foundation models. As a result, many recent approaches rely on 2D vision foundation models trained on natural images, repurposing them as feature extractors for medical scans with surprisingly strong performance. Despite their practical success, current methods that apply 2D foundation models to 3D scans via slice-based decomposition remain fundamentally limited. Standard slicing along axial, sagittal, and coronal planes often fails to capture the true spatial extent of a structure when its orientation does not align with these canonical views. More critically, most approaches aggregate slice features independently, ignoring the underlying 3D geometry and losing spatial coherence across slices. To overcome these limitations, we propose TomoGraphView, a novel framework that integrates omnidirectional volume slicing with spherical graph-based feature aggregation. Instead of restricting the model to axial, sagittal, or coronal planes, our method samples both canonical and non-canonical cross-sections generated from uniformly distributed points on a sphere enclosing the volume. We publicly share our accessible code base at http://github.com/compai-lab/2025-MedIA-kiechle and provide a user-friendly library for omnidirectional volume slicing at https://pypi.org/project/OmniSlicer.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint submitted to Medical Image Analysis (MedIA)</p></details> |

Despite decades of research and numerous imputation methods, the literature remains fragmented across fields, creating a critical need for a comprehensive synthesis that connects statistical foundations with modern machine learning advances. This work systematically reviews core concepts-including missingness mechanisms, single versus multiple imputation, and different imputation goals-and examines problem characteristics across various domains. It provides a thorough categorization of imputation methods, spanning classical techniques (e.g., regression, the EM algorithm) to modern approaches like low-rank and high-rank matrix completion, deep learning models (autoencoders, GANs, diffusion models, graph neural networks), and large language models. Special attention is given to methods for complex data types, such as tensors, time series, streaming data, graph-structured data, categorical data, and multimodal data. Beyond methodology, we investigate the crucial integration of imputation with downstream tasks like classification, clustering, and anomaly detection, examining both sequential pipelines and joint optimization frameworks. The review also assesses theoretical guarantees, benchmarking resources, and evaluation metrics. Finally, we identify critical challenges and future directions, emphasizing model selection and hyperparameter optimization, the growing importance of privacy-preserving imputation via federated learning, and the pursuit of generalizable models that can adapt across domains and data types, thereby outlining a roadmap for future research.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficiently Learning Branching Networks for Multitask Algorithmic Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01113v1)** | 2025-11-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Algorithmic reasoning -- the ability to perform step-by-step logical inference -- has become a core benchmark for evaluating reasoning in graph neural networks (GNNs) and large language models (LLMs). Ideally, one would like to design a single model capable of performing well on multiple algorithmic reasoning tasks simultaneously. However, this is challenging when the execution steps of algorithms differ from one another, causing negative interference when they are trained together. We propose branching neural networks, a principled architecture for multitask algorithmic reasoning. Searching for the optimal $k$-ary tree with $L$ layers over $n$ algorithmic tasks is combinatorial, requiring exploration of up to $k^{nL}$ possible structures. We develop AutoBRANE, an efficient algorithm that reduces this search to $O(nL)$ time by solving a convex relaxation at each layer to approximate an optimal task partition. The method clusters tasks using gradient-based affinity scores and can be used on top of any base model, including GNNs and LLMs. We validate AutoBRANE on a broad suite of graph-algorithmic and text-based reasoning benchmarks. We show that gradient features estimate true task performance within 5% error across four GNNs and four LLMs (up to 34B parameters). On the CLRS benchmark, it outperforms the strongest single multitask GNN by 3.7% and the best baseline by 1.2%, while reducing runtime by 48% and memory usage by 26%. The learned branching structures reveal an intuitively reasonable hierarchical clustering of related algorithms. On three text-based graph reasoning benchmarks, AutoBRANE improves over the best non-branching multitask baseline by 3.2%.

| **[Approximate Bayesian Inference on Mechanisms of Network Growth and Evolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03092v1)** | 2025-11-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mechanistic models can provide an intuitive and interpretable explanation of network growth by specifying a set of generative rules. These rules can be defined by domain knowledge about real-world mechanisms governing network growth or may be designed to facilitate the appearance of certain network motifs. In the formation of real-world networks, multiple mechanisms may be simultaneously involved; it is then important to understand the relative contribution of each of these mechanisms. In this paper, we propose the use of a conditional density estimator, augmented with a graph neural network, to perform inference on a flexible mixture of network-forming mechanisms. This event-wise mixture-of-mechanisms model assigns mechanisms to each edge formation event rather than stipulating node-level mechanisms, thus allowing for an explanation of the network generation process, as well as the dynamic evolution of the network over time. We demonstrate that our approximate Bayesian approach yields valid inferences for the relative weights of the mechanisms in our model, and we utilize this method to investigate the mechanisms behind the formation of a variety of real-world networks.</p></details> | 24 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Evaluating Spatio-Temporal Forecasting Trade-offs Between Graph Neural Networks and Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05179v2)** | 2025-11-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern IoT deployments for environmental sensing produce high volume spatiotemporal data to support downstream tasks such as forecasting, typically powered by machine learning models. While existing filtering and strategic deployment techniques optimize collected data volume at the edge, they overlook how variations in sampling frequencies and spatial coverage affect downstream model performance. In many forecasting models, incorporating data from additional sensors denoise predictions by providing broader spatial contexts. This interplay between sampling frequency, spatial coverage and different forecasting model architectures remain underexplored. This work presents a systematic study of forecasting models - classical models (VAR), neural networks (GRU, Transformer), spatio-temporal graph neural networks (STGNNs), and time series foundation models (TSFMs: Chronos Moirai, TimesFM) under varying spatial sensor nodes density and sampling intervals using real-world temperature data in a wireless sensor network. Our results show that STGNNs are effective when sensor deployments are sparse and sampling rate is moderate, leveraging spatial correlations via encoded graph structure to compensate for limited coverage. In contrast, TSFMs perform competitively at high frequencies but degrade when spatial coverage from neighboring sensors is reduced. Crucially, the multivariate TSFM Moirai outperforms all models by natively learning cross-sensor dependencies. These findings offer actionable insights for building efficient forecasting pipelines in spatio-temporal systems. All code for model configurations, training, dataset, and logs are open-sourced for reproducibility: https://github.com/UIUC-MONET-Projects/Benchmarking-Spatiotemporal-Forecast-Models</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph Data Augmentation with Contrastive Learning on Covariate Distribution Shift](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00716v1)** | 2025-11-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Covariate distribution shift occurs when certain structural features present in the test set are absent from the training set. It is a common type of out-of-distribution (OOD) problem, frequently encountered in real-world graph data with complex structures. Existing research has revealed that most out-of-the-box graph neural networks (GNNs) fail to account for covariate shifts. Furthermore, we observe that existing methods aimed at addressing covariate shifts often fail to fully leverage the rich information contained within the latent space. Motivated by the potential of the latent space, we introduce a new method called MPAIACL for More Powerful Adversarial Invariant Augmentation using Contrastive Learning. MPAIACL leverages contrastive learning to unlock the full potential of vector representations by harnessing their intrinsic information. Through extensive experiments, MPAIACL demonstrates its robust generalization and effectiveness, as it performs well compared with other baselines across various public OOD datasets. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/flzeng1/MPAIACL.</p></details> | 8 tables, 8 figures |
| **[Local Fragments, Global Gains: Subgraph Counting using Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19659v5)** | 2025-11-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Subgraph counting is a fundamental task for analyzing structural patterns in graph-structured data, with important applications in domains such as computational biology and social network analysis, where recurring motifs reveal functional and organizational properties. In this paper, we propose localized versions of the Weisfeiler-Leman (WL) algorithms to improve both expressivity and computational efficiency for this task. We introduce Local $k$-WL, which we prove to be more expressive than $k$-WL and at most as expressive as $(k+1)$-WL, and provide a characterization of patterns whose subgraph and induced subgraph counts are invariant under Local $k$-WL equivalence. To enhance scalability, we present two variants -- Layer $k$-WL and Recursive $k$-WL -- that achieve greater time and space efficiency compared to applying $k$-WL on the entire graph. Additionally, we propose a novel fragmentation technique that decomposes complex subgraphs into simpler subpatterns, enabling the exact count of all induced subgraphs of size at most $4$ using only $1$-WL, with extensions possible for larger patterns when $k>1$. Building on these ideas, we develop a three-stage differentiable learning framework that combines subpattern counts to compute counts of more complex motifs, bridging combinatorial algorithm design with machine learning approaches. We also compare the expressive power of Local $k$-WL with existing GNN hierarchies and demonstrate that, under bounded time complexity, our methods are more expressive than prior approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hierarchical Molecular Language Models (HMLMs)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00696v1)** | 2025-11-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cellular signaling networks represent complex information processing systems that have been modeled via traditional mathematical or statistical approaches. However, these methods often struggle to capture context-dependent signaling, pathway cross-talk, and temporal dynamics across multiple biological scales. Here, we introduce hierarchical molecular language models (HMLMs), a novel architecture that proposes a molecular network-specific large language model (LLM) to use in intracellular communication as a specialized molecular language, which includes molecules as tokens, protein interactions, post-translational modifications, and regulatory events modeled as semantic relationships within an adapted transformer architecture. HMLMs employ graph-structured attention mechanisms to accommodate signaling network topology while integrating information across the molecular, pathway, and cellular scales through hierarchical attention patterns. We demonstrate HMLM superiority using a cardiac fibroblast signaling network comprising over 100 molecular species across functional modules connected by regulatory edges. HMLM achieved a mean squared error (MSE) of 0.058 for temporal signaling predictions, representing 30% improvement over graph neural networks (GNNs: 0.083) and 52% improvement over ordinary differential equation models (ODEs: 0.121), with particular advantages under sparse temporal sampling conditions where HMLM maintained MSE = 0.041 with only 4 time-points. The HMLMs offer a foundation for AI-driven biology and medicine with predictable scaling characteristics suitable for interactive applications. By bridging molecular mechanisms with cellular phenotypes through AI-driven molecular language representation, HMLMs provide a powerful paradigm for systems biology that advances precision medicine applications and therapeutic discovery in the era of AI.</p></details> |  |
| **[TrojanLoC: LLM-based Framework for RTL Trojan Localization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00591v1)** | 2025-11-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hardware Trojans (HT s) are a persistent threat to integrated circuits, especially when inserted at the register-transfer level (RTL). Existing methods typically first convert the design into a graph, such as a gate-level netlist or an RTL-derived dataflow graph (DFG), and then use a graph neural network (GNN ) to obtain an embedding of that graph, which (i) loses compact RTL semantics, (ii) relies on shallow GNNs with limited receptive field, and (iii) is largely restricted to coarse, module-level binary HT detection. We propose TrojanLoC, an LLM-based framework for RTL-level HT localization. We use an RTL-finetuned LLM to derive module-level and line-level embeddings directly from RTL code, capturing both global design context and local semantics. Next, we train task-specific classifiers on these embeddings to perform module-level Trojan detection, type prediction, and fine-grained line-level localization. We also introduce TrojanInS, a large synthetic dataset of RTL designs with systematically injected Trojans from four effect-based categories, each accompanied by precise line-level annotations. Our experiments show that TrojanLoC achieves strong module-level performance, reaching 0.99 F1-score for Trojan detection, up to 0.68 higher than baseline, and 0.84 macro-F1 for Trojan-type classification. At the line level, TrojanLoc further achieves up to 0.93 macro-F1, enabling fine-grained localization of Trojan-relevant RTL lines</p></details> |  |
| **[A Graph Neural Network Approach for Localized and High-Resolution Temperature Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00546v1)** | 2025-11-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Heatwaves are intensifying worldwide and are among the deadliest weather disasters. The burden falls disproportionately on marginalized populations and the Global South, where under-resourced health systems, exposure to urban heat islands, and the lack of adaptive infrastructure amplify risks. Yet current numerical weather prediction models often fail to capture micro-scale extremes, leaving the most vulnerable excluded from timely early warnings. We present a Graph Neural Network framework for localized, high-resolution temperature forecasting. By leveraging spatial learning and efficient computation, our approach generates forecasts at multiple horizons, up to 48 hours. For Southwestern Ontario, Canada, the model captures temperature patterns with a mean MAE of 1.93$^{\circ}$C across 1-48h forecasts and MAE@48h of 2.93$^{\circ}$C, evaluated using 24h input windows on the largest region. While demonstrated here in a data-rich context, this work lays the foundation for transfer learning approaches that could enable localized, equitable forecasts in data-limited regions of the Global South.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 2 figures.
