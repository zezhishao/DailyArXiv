| **[Advanced Hybrid Transformer LSTM Technique with Attention and TS Mixer for Drilling Rate of Penetration Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05210v3)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Rate of Penetration (ROP) prediction is critical for drilling optimization yet remains challenging due to the nonlinear, dynamic, and heterogeneous characteristics of drilling data. Conventional empirical, physics-based, and standard machine learning models rely on oversimplified assumptions or intensive feature engineering, constraining their capacity to model long-term dependencies and intricate feature interactions. To address these issues, this study presents a new deep learning Hybrid LSTM-Trans-Mixer-Att framework that first processes input data through a customized Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network to capture multi-scale temporal dependencies aligned with drilling cycles. Subsequently, an Enhanced Transformer encoder with drilling-specific positional encodings and real-time optimization refines the features. Concurrently, a parallel Time-Series Mixer (TS-Mixer) block introduced facilitates efficient cross-feature interaction modeling of static and categorical parameters, including lithological indices and mud properties. The feature representations extracted from the Enhanced Transformer and TS-Mixer modules are integrated through a dedicated fusion layer. Finally, an adaptive attention mechanism then dynamically assigns contextual weights to salient features, enhancing discriminative representation learning and enabling high-fidelity ROP prediction. The proposed framework combines sequential memory, static feature interactions, global context learning, and dynamic feature weighting, providing a comprehensive solution for the heterogeneous and event-driven nature of drilling dynamics. Experimental validation on real-world drilling datasets demonstrates superior performance, achieving an Rsquare of 0.9991 and a MAPE of 1.447%, significantly outperforming existing baseline and hybrid models.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 Pa...</summary><p>31 Pages, 16 Figures, 9 Tables</p></details> |
| **[Synapse: Adaptive Arbitration of Complementary Expertise in Time Series Foundational Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05460v1)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pre-trained Time Series Foundational Models (TSFMs) represent a significant advance, capable of forecasting diverse time series with complex characteristics, including varied seasonalities, trends, and long-range dependencies. Despite their primary goal of universal time series forecasting, their efficacy is far from uniform; divergent training protocols and data sources cause individual TSFMs to exhibit highly variable performance across different forecasting tasks, domains, and horizons. Leveraging this complementary expertise by arbitrating existing TSFM outputs presents a compelling strategy, yet this remains a largely unexplored area of research. In this paper, we conduct a thorough examination of how different TSFMs exhibit specialized performance profiles across various forecasting settings, and how we can effectively leverage this behavior in arbitration between different time series models. We specifically analyze how factors such as model selection and forecast horizon distribution can influence the efficacy of arbitration strategies. Based on this analysis, we propose Synapse, a novel arbitration framework for TSFMs. Synapse is designed to dynamically leverage a pool of TSFMs, assign and adjust predictive weights based on their relative, context-dependent performance, and construct a robust forecast distribution by adaptively sampling from the output quantiles of constituent models. Experimental results demonstrate that Synapse consistently outperforms other popular ensembling techniques as well as individual TSFMs, demonstrating Synapse's efficacy in time series forecasting.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 7 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |
| **[Embedding-Space Data Augmentation to Prevent Membership Inference Attacks in Clinical Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05289v1)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Balancing strong privacy guarantees with high predictive performance is critical for time series forecasting (TSF) tasks involving Electronic Health Records (EHR). In this study, we explore how data augmentation can mitigate Membership Inference Attacks (MIA) on TSF models. We show that retraining with synthetic data can substantially reduce the effectiveness of loss-based MIAs by reducing the attacker's true-positive to false-positive ratio. The key challenge is generating synthetic samples that closely resemble the original training data to confuse the attacker, while also introducing enough novelty to enhance the model's ability to generalize to unseen data. We examine multiple augmentation strategies - Zeroth-Order Optimization (ZOO), a variant of ZOO constrained by Principal Component Analysis (ZOO-PCA), and MixUp - to strengthen model resilience without sacrificing accuracy. Our experimental results show that ZOO-PCA yields the best reductions in TPR/FPR ratio for MIA attacks without sacrificing performance on test data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as a proceedings paper at Machine Learning for Health (ML4H) symposium 2025, December 1-2, 2025, San Diego, United States, 15 pages</p></details> |
| **[Two-stage hybrid models for enhancing forecasting accuracy on heterogeneous time series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08600v2)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A time series forecasting model--which is typically built on a single time series--is known as a local time series model (tsLM). In contrast, a forecasting model trained on multiple time series is referred to as a global time series model (tsGM). tsGMs can enhance forecasting accuracy and improve generalisation by learning cross-series information. As such, developing tsGMs has become a prominent research focus within the time series forecasting community. However, the benefits of tsGMs may not always be realised if the given set of time series is heterogeneous. While increasing model complexity can help tsGMs adapt to such a set of data, it can also increase the risk of overfitting and forecasting error. Additionally, the definition of homogeneity remains ambiguous in the literature. To address these challenges, this paper explores how to define data heterogeneity and proposes a two-stage modelling framework: At stage one, a tsGM is learnt to identify homogeneous patterns; and at stage two, tsLMs (e.g., ARIMA) or sub-tsGMs tailored to different groups are learnt to capture the heterogeneity. Numerical experiments on four open datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly outperforms six state-of-the-art models. These results highlight its effectiveness in unlocking the full potential of global forecasting models for heterogeneous datasets.</p></details> | 8 pages, 5 figures |
| **[A Comparative Study of Online Disinformation and Offline Protests](http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.11000v5)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper evaluates the effect of online disinformation upon offline political protests with a time series cross-sectional sample of 125 countries in a period between 2000 and 2019. The results are mixed. Based on Bayesian multi-level regression modeling, (i) there indeed is an effect between online disinformation and offline protests, but the effect is partially meditated by political polarization. The results are clearer in a sample of countries belonging to the European Economic Area. With this sample, (ii) offline protest counts increase from online disinformation disseminated by domestic governments, political parties, and politicians as well as by foreign governments. Furthermore, (iii) Internet shutdowns tend to decrease the counts, although, paradoxically, the absence of governmental online monitoring of social media tends to also decrease these. With these results, the paper contributes to the blossoming disinformation research by modeling the impact of disinformation upon offline phenomenon. The contribution is important due to the various policy measures planned or already enacted.</p></details> | <details><summary>SN So...</summary><p>SN Social Sciences, 2024, vol. 4, article no. 232, pp. 1-18</p></details> |
| **[No One-Model-Fits-All: Uncovering Spatio-Temporal Forecasting Trade-offs with Graph Neural Networks and Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05179v1)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern IoT deployments for environmental sensing produce high volume spatiotemporal data to support downstream tasks such as forecasting, typically powered by machine learning models. While existing filtering and strategic deployment techniques optimize collected data volume at the edge, they overlook how variations in sampling frequencies and spatial coverage affect downstream model performance. In many forecasting models, incorporating data from additional sensors denoise predictions by providing broader spatial contexts. This interplay between sampling frequency, spatial coverage and different forecasting model architectures remain underexplored. This work presents a systematic study of forecasting models - classical models (VAR), neural networks (GRU, Transformer), spatio-temporal graph neural networks (STGNNs), and time series foundation models (TSFMs: Chronos Moirai, TimesFM) under varying spatial sensor nodes density and sampling intervals using real-world temperature data in a wireless sensor network. Our results show that STGNNs are effective when sensor deployments are sparse and sampling rate is moderate, leveraging spatial correlations via encoded graph structure to compensate for limited coverage. In contrast, TSFMs perform competitively at high frequencies but degrade when spatial coverage from neighboring sensors is reduced. Crucially, the multivariate TSFM Moirai outperforms all models by natively learning cross-sensor dependencies. These findings offer actionable insights for building efficient forecasting pipelines in spatio-temporal systems. All code for model configurations, training, dataset, and logs are open-sourced for reproducibility: https://github.com/UIUC-MONET-Projects/Benchmarking-Spatiotemporal-Forecast-Models</p></details> |  |
| **[RNN(p) for Power Consumption Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.01378v2)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>An elementary Recurrent Neural Network that operates on p time lags, called an RNN(p), is the natural generalisation of a linear autoregressive model ARX(p). It is a powerful forecasting tool for variables displaying inherent seasonal patterns across multiple time scales, as is often observed in energy, economic, and financial time series. The architecture of RNN(p) models, characterised by structured feedbacks across time lags, enables the design of efficient training strategies. We conduct a comparative study of learning algorithms for these models, providing a rigorous analysis of their computational complexity and training performance. We present two applications of RNN(p) models in power consumption forecasting, a key domain within the energy sector where accurate forecasts inform both operational and financial decisions. Experimental results show that RNN(p) models achieve excellent forecasting accuracy while maintaining a high degree of interpretability. These features make them well-suited for decision-making in energy markets and other fintech applications where reliable predictions play a significant economic role.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exponential Spatiotemporal GARCH Model with Asymmetric Volatility Spillovers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05126v1)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces a spatiotemporal exponential generalised autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (spatiotemporal E-GARCH) model, extending traditional spatiotemporal GARCH models by incorporating asymmetric volatility spillovers, while also generalising the time-series E-GARCH model to a spatiotemporal setting with instantaneous, potentially asymmetric volatility spillovers across space. The model allows for both temporal and spatial dependencies in volatility dynamics, capturing how financial shocks propagate across time, space, and network structures. We establish the theoretical properties of the model, deriving stationarity conditions and moment existence results. For estimation, we propose a quasi-maximum likelihood (QML) estimator and assess its finite-sample performance through Monte Carlo simulations. Empirically, we apply the model to financial networks, specifically analysing volatility spillovers in stock markets. We compare different network structures and analyse asymmetric effects in instantaneous volatility interactions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to the Journal of Econometrics and Statistics</p></details> |
| **[QuAnTS: Question Answering on Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05124v1)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text offers intuitive access to information. This can, in particular, complement the density of numerical time series, thereby allowing improved interactions with time series models to enhance accessibility and decision-making. While the creation of question-answering datasets and models has recently seen remarkable growth, most research focuses on question answering (QA) on vision and text, with time series receiving minute attention. To bridge this gap, we propose a challenging novel time series QA (TSQA) dataset, QuAnTS, for Question Answering on Time Series data. Specifically, we pose a wide variety of questions and answers about human motion in the form of tracked skeleton trajectories. We verify that the large-scale QuAnTS dataset is well-formed and comprehensive through extensive experiments. Thoroughly evaluating existing and newly proposed baselines then lays the groundwork for a deeper exploration of TSQA using QuAnTS. Additionally, we provide human performances as a key reference for gauging the practical usability of such models. We hope to encourage future research on interacting with time series models through text, enabling better decision-making and more transparent systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[On the Estimation of Climate Normals and Anomalies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05071v1)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The quantification of the interannual component of variability in climatological time series is essential for the assessment and prediction of the El Ni\~{n}o - Southern Oscillation phenomenon. This is achieved by estimating the deviation of a climate variable (e.g., temperature, pressure, precipitation, or wind strength) from its normal conditions, defined by its baseline level and seasonal patterns. Climate normals are currently estimated by simple arithmetic averages calculated over the most recent 30-year period ending in a year divisible by 10. The suitability of the standard methodology has been questioned in the context of a changing climate, characterized by nonstationary conditions. The literature has focused on the choice of the bandwidth and the ability to account for trends induced by climate change. The paper contributes to the literature by proposing a regularized real time filter based on local trigonometric regression, optimizing the estimation bias-variance trade-off in the presence of climate change, and by introducing a class of seasonal kernels enhancing the localization of the estimates of climate normals. Application to sea surface temperature series in the \nino 3.4 region and zonal and trade winds strength in the equatorial and tropical Pacific region, illustrates the relevance of our proposal.</p></details> |  |
| **[CTPD: Cross-Modal Temporal Pattern Discovery for Enhanced Multimodal Electronic Health Records Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00696v3)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Integrating multimodal Electronic Health Records (EHR) data, such as numerical time series and free-text clinical reports, has great potential in predicting clinical outcomes. However, prior work has primarily focused on capturing temporal interactions within individual samples and fusing multimodal information, overlooking critical temporal patterns across patients. These patterns, such as trends in vital signs like abnormal heart rate or blood pressure, can indicate deteriorating health or an impending critical event. Similarly, clinical notes often contain textual descriptions that reflect these patterns. Identifying corresponding temporal patterns across different modalities is crucial for improving the accuracy of clinical outcome predictions, yet it remains a challenging task. To address this gap, we introduce a Cross-Modal Temporal Pattern Discovery (CTPD) framework, designed to efficiently extract meaningful cross-modal temporal patterns from multimodal EHR data. Our approach introduces shared initial temporal pattern representations which are refined using slot attention to generate temporal semantic embeddings. To ensure rich cross-modal temporal semantics in the learned patterns, we introduce a contrastive-based TPNCE loss for cross-modal alignment, along with two reconstruction losses to retain core information of each modality. Evaluations on two clinically critical tasks, 48-hour in-hospital mortality and 24-hour phenotype classification, using the MIMIC-III database demonstrate the superiority of our method over existing approaches.</p></details> | ACL 2025 Findings |
| **[Carbon Price Forecasting with Structural Breaks: A Comparative Study of Deep Learning Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04988v1)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurately forecasting carbon prices is essential for informed energy market decision-making, guiding sustainable energy planning, and supporting effective decarbonization strategies. However, it remains challenging due to structural breaks and high-frequency noise caused by frequent policy interventions and market shocks. Existing studies, including the most recent baseline approaches, have attempted to incorporate breakpoints but often treat denoising and modeling as separate processes and lack systematic evaluation across advanced deep learning architectures, limiting the robustness and the generalization capability. To address these gaps, this paper proposes a comprehensive hybrid framework that integrates structural break detection (Bai-Perron, ICSS, and PELT algorithms), wavelet signal denoising, and three state-of-the-art deep learning models (LSTM, GRU, and TCN). Using European Union Allowance (EUA) spot prices from 2007 to 2024 and exogenous features such as energy prices and policy indicators, the framework constructs univariate and multivariate datasets for comparative evaluation. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed PELT-WT-TCN achieves the highest prediction accuracy, reducing forecasting errors by 22.35% in RMSE and 18.63% in MAE compared to the state-of-the-art baseline model (Breakpoints with Wavelet and LSTM), and by 70.55% in RMSE and 74.42% in MAE compared to the original LSTM without decomposition from the same baseline study. These findings underscore the value of integrating structural awareness and multiscale decomposition into deep learning architectures to enhance accuracy and interpretability in carbon price forecasting and other nonstationary financial time series.</p></details> |  |
| **[Less Is More: Generating Time Series with LLaMA-Style Autoregression in Simple Factorized Latent Spaces](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04973v1)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative models for multivariate time series are essential for data augmentation, simulation, and privacy preservation, yet current state-of-the-art diffusion-based approaches are slow and limited to fixed-length windows. We propose FAR-TS, a simple yet effective framework that combines disentangled factorization with an autoregressive Transformer over a discrete, quantized latent space to generate time series. Each time series is decomposed into a data-adaptive basis that captures static cross-channel correlations and temporal coefficients that are vector-quantized into discrete tokens. A LLaMA-style autoregressive Transformer then models these token sequences, enabling fast and controllable generation of sequences with arbitrary length. Owing to its streamlined design, FAR-TS achieves orders-of-magnitude faster generation than Diffusion-TS while preserving cross-channel correlations and an interpretable latent space, enabling high-quality and flexible time series synthesis.</p></details> |  |
| **[Closed-Form Beta Distribution Estimation from Sparse Statistics with Random Forest Implicit Regularization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23767v2)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work advances distribution recovery from sparse data and ensemble classification through three main contributions. First, we introduce a closed-form estimator that reconstructs scaled beta distributions from limited statistics (minimum, maximum, mean, and median) via composite quantile and moment matching. The recovered parameters $(\alpha,\beta)$, when used as features in Random Forest classifiers, improve pairwise classification on time-series snapshots, validating the fidelity of the recovered distributions. Second, we establish a link between classification accuracy and distributional closeness by deriving error bounds that constrain total variation distance and Jensen-Shannon divergence, the latter exhibiting quadratic convergence. Third, we show that zero-variance features act as an implicit regularizer, increasing selection probability for mid-ranked predictors and producing deeper, more varied trees. A SeatGeek pricing dataset serves as the primary application, illustrating distributional recovery and event-level classification while situating these methods within the structure and dynamics of the secondary ticket marketplace. The UCI handwritten digits dataset confirms the broader regularization effect. Overall, the study outlines a practical route from sparse distributional snapshots to closed-form estimation and improved ensemble accuracy, with reliability enhanced through implicit regularization.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages, 12 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |
| **[TimeCopilot](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00616v3)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce TimeCopilot, the first open-source agentic framework for forecasting that combines multiple Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) with Large Language Models (LLMs) through a single unified API. TimeCopilot automates the forecasting pipeline: feature analysis, model selection, cross-validation, and forecast generation, while providing natural language explanations and supporting direct queries about the future. The framework is LLM-agnostic, compatible with both commercial and open-source models, and supports ensembles across diverse forecasting families. Results on the large-scale GIFT-Eval benchmark show that TimeCopilot achieves state-of-the-art probabilistic forecasting performance at low cost. Our framework provides a practical foundation for reproducible, explainable, and accessible agentic forecasting systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Clustering in Networks with Time-varying Nodal Attributes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04859v1)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This manuscript studies nodal clustering in graphs having a time series at each node. The framework includes priors for low-dimensional representations and a decoder that bridges the latent representations and time series. The structural and temporal patterns are fused into representations that facilitate clustering, addressing the limitation that the evolution of nodal attributes is often overlooked. Parameters are learned via maximum approximate likelihood, with a graph-fused LASSO regularization imposed on prior parameters. The optimization problem is solved via alternating direction method of multipliers; Langevin dynamics are employed for posterior inference. Simulation studies on block and grid graphs with autoregressive dynamics, and applications to California county temperatures and a book word co-occurrence network demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</p></details> |  |
| **[Probabilistic Textual Time Series Depression Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04476v1)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate and interpretable predictions of depression severity are essential for clinical decision support, yet existing models often lack uncertainty estimates and temporal modeling. We propose PTTSD, a Probabilistic Textual Time Series Depression Detection framework that predicts PHQ-8 scores from utterance-level clinical interviews while modeling uncertainty over time. PTTSD includes sequence-to-sequence and sequence-to-one variants, both combining bidirectional LSTMs, self-attention, and residual connections with Gaussian or Student-t output heads trained via negative log-likelihood. Evaluated on E-DAIC and DAIC-WOZ, PTTSD achieves state-of-the-art performance among text-only systems (e.g., MAE = 3.85 on E-DAIC, 3.55 on DAIC) and produces well-calibrated prediction intervals. Ablations confirm the value of attention and probabilistic modeling, while comparisons with MentalBERT establish generality. A three-part calibration analysis and qualitative case studies further highlight the interpretability and clinical relevance of uncertainty-aware forecasting.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 8 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |
| **[Towards Causal Market Simulators](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04469v1)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Market generators using deep generative models have shown promise for synthetic financial data generation, but existing approaches lack causal reasoning capabilities essential for counterfactual analysis and risk assessment. We propose a Time-series Neural Causal Model VAE (TNCM-VAE) that combines variational autoencoders with structural causal models to generate counterfactual financial time series while preserving both temporal dependencies and causal relationships. Our approach enforces causal constraints through directed acyclic graphs in the decoder architecture and employs the causal Wasserstein distance for training. We validate our method on synthetic autoregressive models inspired by the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, demonstrating superior performance in counterfactual probability estimation with L1 distances as low as 0.03-0.10 compared to ground truth. The model enables financial stress testing, scenario analysis, and enhanced backtesting by generating plausible counterfactual market trajectories that respect underlying causal mechanisms.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICAIF...</summary><p>ICAIF 2025 Workshop on Rethinking Financial Time-Series</p></details> |
| **[ForecastGAN: A Decomposition-Based Adversarial Framework for Multi-Horizon Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04445v1)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting is essential across domains from finance to supply chain management. This paper introduces ForecastGAN, a novel decomposition based adversarial framework addressing limitations in existing approaches for multi-horizon predictions. Although transformer models excel in long-term forecasting, they often underperform in short-term scenarios and typically ignore categorical features. ForecastGAN operates through three integrated modules: a Decomposition Module that extracts seasonality and trend components; a Model Selection Module that identifies optimal neural network configurations based on forecasting horizon; and an Adversarial Training Module that enhances prediction robustness through Conditional Generative Adversarial Network training. Unlike conventional approaches, ForecastGAN effectively integrates both numerical and categorical features. We validate our framework on eleven benchmark multivariate time series datasets that span various forecasting horizons. The results show that ForecastGAN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art transformer models for short-term forecasting while remaining competitive for long-term horizons. This research establishes a more generalizable approach to time series forecasting that adapts to specific contexts while maintaining strong performance across diverse data characteristics without extensive hyperparameter tuning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Porti...</summary><p>Portions of this work were previously published in the author's Master's thesis at University of Windsor (2024)</p></details> |
| **[SolarCrossFormer: Improving day-ahead Solar Irradiance Forecasting by Integrating Satellite Imagery and Ground Sensors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15827v2)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate day-ahead forecasts of solar irradiance are required for the large-scale integration of solar photovoltaic (PV) systems into the power grid. However, current forecasting solutions lack the temporal and spatial resolution required by system operators. In this paper, we introduce SolarCrossFormer, a novel deep learning model for day-ahead irradiance forecasting, that combines satellite images and time series from a ground-based network of meteorological stations. SolarCrossFormer uses novel graph neural networks to exploit the inter- and intra-modal correlations of the input data and improve the accuracy and resolution of the forecasts. It generates probabilistic forecasts for any location in Switzerland with a 15-minute resolution for horizons up to 24 hours ahead. One of the key advantages of SolarCrossFormer its robustness in real life operations. It can incorporate new time-series data without retraining the model and, additionally, it can produce forecasts for locations without input data by using only their coordinates. Experimental results over a dataset of one year and 127 locations across Switzerland show that SolarCrossFormer yield a normalized mean absolute error of 6.1 % over the forecasting horizon. The results are competitive with those achieved by a commercial numerical weather prediction service.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 18 figures, accepted for publication in IEEE Transactions on Sustainable Energy</p></details> |

Current approaches model electricity prices without explicit causal interpretation or counterfactual reasoning capabilities. We introduce Augmented Time Series Causal Models (ATSCM) for energy markets, extending counterfactual reasoning frameworks to multivariate temporal data with learned causal structure. Our approach models energy systems through interpretable factors (weather, generation mix, demand patterns), rich grid dynamics, and observable market variables. We integrate neural causal discovery to learn time-varying causal graphs without requiring ground truth DAGs. Applied to real-world electricity price data, ATSCM enables novel counterfactual queries such as "What would prices be under different renewable generation scenarios?".</p></details> | <details><summary>EurIP...</summary><p>EurIPS 2025 Workshop Causality for Impact: Practical challenges for real-world applications of causal methods</p></details> |

Remaining Useful Life (RUL) prediction is a key component of this process; however, many existing models struggle to capture fine-grained temporal dependencies while dynamically prioritizing critical features across time for robust prognostics. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework that integrates Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCNs) for localized temporal feature extraction with a modified Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT) enhanced by Bi-LSTM encoder-decoder. This architecture effectively bridges short- and long-term dependencies while emphasizing salient temporal patterns. Furthermore, the incorporation of a multi-time-window methodology improves adaptability across diverse operating conditions. Extensive evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed model reduces the average RMSE by up to 5.5%, underscoring its improved predictive accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods. By closing critical gaps in current approaches, this framework advances the effectiveness of industrial prognostic systems and highlights the potential of advanced time-series transformers for RUL prediction.</p></details> |  |
| **[AWEMixer: Adaptive Wavelet-Enhanced Mixer Network for Long-Term Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04722v1)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Forecasting long-term time series in IoT environments remains a significant challenge due to the non-stationary and multi-scale characteristics of sensor signals. Furthermore, error accumulation causes a decrease in forecast quality when predicting further into the future. Traditional methods are restricted to operate in time-domain, while the global frequency information achieved by Fourier transform would be regarded as stationary signals leading to blur the temporal patterns of transient events. We propose AWEMixer, an Adaptive Wavelet-Enhanced Mixer Network including two innovative components: 1) a Frequency Router designs to utilize the global periodicity pattern achieved by Fast Fourier Transform to adaptively weight localized wavelet subband, and 2) a Coherent Gated Fusion Block to achieve selective integration of prominent frequency features with multi-scale temporal representation through cross-attention and gating mechanism, which realizes accurate time-frequency localization while remaining robust to noise. Seven public benchmarks validate that our model is more effective than recent state-of-the-art models. Specifically, our model consistently achieves performance improvement compared with transformer-based and MLP-based state-of-the-art models in long-sequence time series forecasting.

Most existing CTG studies relied on domain-specific models and lack systematic comparisons with modern foundation or language models, limiting our understanding of whether these models can outperform specialized systems in fetal health assessment. In this study, we present the first comprehensive benchmark of state-of-the-art architectures for automated antepartum CTG classification. Over 2,500 20-minutes recordings were used to evaluate over 15 models spanning domain-specific, time-series, foundation, and language-model categories under a unified framework. Fine-tuned LLMs consistently outperformed both foundation and domain-specific models across data-availability scenarios, except when uterine-activity signals were absent, where domain-specific models showed greater robustness. These performance gains, however, required substantially higher computational resources. Our results highlight that while fine-tuned LLMs achieved state-of-the-art performance for CTG classification, practical deployment must balance performance with computational efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepa...</summary><p>Preparing for journal</p></details> |
| **[Estimation of Independent Component Analysis Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04273v1)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although approaches to Independent Component Analysis (ICA) based on characteristic function seem theoretically elegant, they may suffer from implementational challenges because of numerical integration steps or selection of tuning parameters. Extending previously considered objective functions and leveraging results from the continuum Generalized Method of Moments of Carrasco and Florens (2000), I derive an optimal estimator that can take a tractable form and thus bypass these concerns. The method shares advantages with characteristic function approaches -- it does not require the existence of higher-order moments or parametric restrictions -- while retaining computational feasibility and asymptotic efficiency. The results are adapted to handle a possible first step that delivers estimated sensors. Finally, a by-product of the approach is a specification test that is valuable in many ICA applications. The method's effectiveness is illustrated through simulations, where the estimator outperforms efficient GMM, JADE, or FastICA, and an application to the estimation of Structural Vector Autoregressions (SVAR), a workhorse of the macroeconometric time series literature.</p></details> |  |

However, it is typically tackled with black-box deep learning methods, making it hard for humans to understand the rationale behind their output. To take on this challenge, we propose a novel approach, STELLE (Signal Temporal logic Embedding for Logically-grounded Learning and Explanation), a neuro-symbolic framework that unifies classification and explanation through direct embedding of trajectories into a space of temporal logic concepts. By introducing a novel STL-inspired kernel that maps raw time series to their alignment with predefined STL formulae, our model jointly optimises accuracy and interpretability, as each prediction is accompanied by the most relevant logical concepts that characterise it. This yields (i) local explanations as human-readable STL conditions justifying individual predictions, and (ii) global explanations as class-characterising formulae. Experiments demonstrate that STELLE achieves competitive accuracy while providing logically faithful explanations, validated on diverse real-world benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted to Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research (JAIR), 2025</p></details> |

However, the mobility demand for our devices naturally imposes constraints on their computational and communication capabilities. A solution is to locally learn knowledge from data captured by ubiquitous devices, rather than to store and transmit the data in its original form. In this paper, we develop a federated learning framework, called Centaur, to incorporate on-device data selection at the edge, which allows partition-based training of a deep neural nets through collaboration between constrained and resourceful devices within the multidevice ecosystem of the same user. We benchmark on five neural net architecture and six datasets that include image data and wearable sensor time series. On average, Centaur achieves ~19% higher classification accuracy and ~58% lower federated training latency, compared to the baseline. We also evaluate Centaur when dealing with imbalanced non-iid data, client participation heterogeneity, and different mobility patterns. To encourage further research in this area, we release our code at https://github.com/nokia-bell-labs/data-centric-federated-learning</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be presented in the 10th ACM/IEEE Symposium on Edge Computing (SEC2025) [an early version (v3) has been presented at ICLR 2023 Workshop on Machine Learning for IoT: Datasets, Perception, and Understanding]</p></details> |

However, existing mod els largely neglect the multi-frequency nature of neuronal oscillations, treating BOLD signals as monolithic time series. This overlooks the cru cial fact that neurological disorders often manifest as disruptions within specific frequency bands, limiting diagnostic sensitivity and specificity. While some methods have attempted to incorporate frequency informa tion, they often rely on predefined frequency bands, which may not be optimal for capturing individual variability or disease-specific alterations. To address this, we propose a novel framework featuring Adaptive Cas cade Decomposition to learn task-relevant frequency sub-bands for each brain region and Frequency-Coupled Connectivity Learning to capture both intra- and nuanced cross-band interactions in a unified functional network. This unified network informs a novel message-passing mecha nism within our Unified-GCN, generating refined node representations for diagnostic prediction. Experimental results on the ADNI and ABIDE datasets demonstrate superior performance over existing methods.

| **[GPU-Based Floating-point Adaptive Lossless Compression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04140v1)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Domains such as IoT (Internet of Things) and HPC (High Performance Computing) generate a torrential influx of floating-point time-series data. Compressing these data while preserving their absolute fidelity is critical, and leveraging the massive parallelism of modern GPUs offers a path to unprecedented throughput. Nevertheless, designing such a high-performance GPU-based lossless compressor faces three key challenges: 1) heterogeneous data movement bottlenecks, 2) precision-preserving conversion complexity, and 3) anomaly-induced sparsity degradation. To address these challenges, this paper proposes Falcon, a GPU-based Floating-point Adaptive Lossless COmpressioN framework. Specifically, Falcon first introduces a lightweight asynchronous pipeline, which hides the I/O latency during the data transmission between the CPU and GPU. Then, we propose an accurate and fast float-to-integer transformation method with theoretical guarantees, which eliminates the errors caused by floating-point arithmetic. Moreover, we devise an adaptive sparse bit-plane lossless encoding strategy, which reduces the sparsity caused by outliers. Extensive experiments on 12 diverse datasets show that our compression ratio improves by 9.1% over the most advanced CPU-based method, with compression throughput 2.43X higher and decompression throughput 2.4X higher than the fastest GPU-based competitors, respectively.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we establish a least square optimization model by combining tensor singular value decomposition (t-SVD) with autoregression (AR) to forecast third-order tensor time-series, which has great benefit in computational complexity and dimensionality reduction. We divide such an optimization problem using fast Fourier transformation and t-SVD into four decoupled subproblems, whose variables include regressive coefficient, f-diagonal tensor, left and right orthogonal tensors, and propose an efficient forecasting algorithm via alternating minimization strategy, called Low-rank Tensor Autoregressive Predictor (LOTAP), in which each subproblem has a closed-form solution. Numerical experiments indicate that, compared to Tucker-decomposition-based algorithms, LOTAP achieves a speed improvement ranging from $2$ to $6$ times while maintaining accurate forecasting performance in all four baseline tasks. In addition, this algorithm is applicable to a wider range of tensor forecasting tasks because of its more effective dimensionality reduction ability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in Expert Systems with Applications</p></details> |

However, leveraging such abilities to model highly stochastic time series data remains a challenge. In this paper, we propose a novel Stochastic Diffusion (StochDiff) model which learns data-driven prior knowledge at each time step by utilizing the representational power of the stochastic latent spaces to model the variability of the multivariate time series data. The learnt prior knowledge helps the model to capture complex temporal dynamics and the inherent uncertainty of the data. This improves its ability to model highly stochastic time series data. Through extensive experiments on real-world datasets, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model on stochastic time series forecasting. Additionally, we showcase an application of our model for real-world surgical guidance, highlighting its potential to benefit the medical community.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 4 figures.

| **[Beyond the Kolmogorov Barrier: A Learnable Weighted Hybrid Autoencoder for Model Order Reduction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18148v5)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Representation learning for high-dimensional, complex physical systems aims to identify a low-dimensional intrinsic latent space, which is crucial for reduced-order modeling and modal analysis. To overcome the well-known Kolmogorov barrier, deep autoencoders (AEs) have been introduced in recent years, but they often suffer from poor convergence behavior as the rank of the latent space increases. To address this issue, we propose the learnable weighted hybrid autoencoder, a hybrid approach that combines the strengths of singular value decomposition (SVD) with deep autoencoders through a learnable weighted framework. We find that the introduction of learnable weighting parameters is essential -- without them, the resulting model would either collapse into a standard POD or fail to exhibit the desired convergence behavior. Interestingly, we empirically find that our trained model has a sharpness thousands of times smaller compared to other models. Our experiments on classical chaotic PDE systems, including the 1D Kuramoto-Sivashinsky and forced isotropic turbulence datasets, demonstrate that our approach significantly improves generalization performance compared to several competing methods. Additionally, when combining with time series modeling techniques (e.g., Koopman operator, LSTM), the proposed technique offers significant improvements for surrogate modeling of high-dimensional multi-scale PDE systems.</p></details> | 34 pages |
| **[Benchmark Datasets for Lead-Lag Forecasting on Social Platforms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03877v1)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Social and collaborative platforms emit multivariate time-series traces in which early interactions-such as views, likes, or downloads-are followed, sometimes months or years later, by higher impact like citations, sales, or reviews. We formalize this setting as Lead-Lag Forecasting (LLF): given an early usage channel (the lead), predict a correlated but temporally shifted outcome channel (the lag). Despite the ubiquity of such patterns, LLF has not been treated as a unified forecasting problem within the time-series community, largely due to the absence of standardized datasets. To anchor research in LLF, here we present two high-volume benchmark datasets-arXiv (accesses -> citations of 2.3M papers) and GitHub (pushes/stars -> forks of 3M repositories)-and outline additional domains with analogous lead-lag dynamics, including Wikipedia (page views -> edits), Spotify (streams -> concert attendance), e-commerce (click-throughs -> purchases), and LinkedIn profile (views -> messages). Our datasets provide ideal testbeds for lead-lag forecasting, by capturing long-horizon dynamics across years, spanning the full spectrum of outcomes, and avoiding survivorship bias in sampling. We documented all technical details of data curation and cleaning, verified the presence of lead-lag dynamics through statistical and classification tests, and benchmarked parametric and non-parametric baselines for regression. Our study establishes LLF as a novel forecasting paradigm and lays an empirical foundation for its systematic exploration in social and usage data.

| **[ROSBag MCP Server: Analyzing Robot Data with LLMs for Agentic Embodied AI Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03497v1)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Agentic AI systems and Physical or Embodied AI systems have been two key research verticals at the forefront of Artificial Intelligence and Robotics, with Model Context Protocol (MCP) increasingly becoming a key component and enabler of agentic applications. However, the literature at the intersection of these verticals, i.e., Agentic Embodied AI, remains scarce. This paper introduces an MCP server for analyzing ROS and ROS 2 bags, allowing for analyzing, visualizing and processing robot data with natural language through LLMs and VLMs. We describe specific tooling built with robotics domain knowledge, with our initial release focused on mobile robotics and supporting natively the analysis of trajectories, laser scan data, transforms, or time series data. This is in addition to providing an interface to standard ROS 2 CLI tools ("ros2 bag list" or "ros2 bag info"), as well as the ability to filter bags with a subset of topics or trimmed in time. Coupled with the MCP server, we provide a lightweight UI that allows the benchmarking of the tooling with different LLMs, both proprietary (Anthropic, OpenAI) and open-source (through Groq). Our experimental results include the analysis of tool calling capabilities of eight different state-of-the-art LLM/VLM models, both proprietary and open-source, large and small. Our experiments indicate that there is a large divide in tool calling capabilities, with Kimi K2 and Claude Sonnet 4 demonstrating clearly superior performance. We also conclude that there are multiple factors affecting the success rates, from the tool description schema to the number of arguments, as well as the number of tools available to the models.

| **[DE3S: Dual-Enhanced Soft-Sparse-Shape Learning for Medical Early Time-Series Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12214v2)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Early Time Series Classification (ETSC) is critical in time-sensitive medical applications such as sepsis, yet it presents an inherent trade-off between accuracy and earliness. This trade-off arises from two core challenges: 1) models should effectively model inherently weak and noisy early-stage snippets, and 2) they should resolve the complex, dual requirement of simultaneously capturing local, subject-specific variations and overarching global temporal patterns. Existing methods struggle to overcome these underlying challenges, often forcing a severe compromise: sacrificing accuracy to achieve earliness, or vice-versa. We propose \textbf{DE3S}, a \textbf{D}ual-\textbf{E}nhanced \textbf{S}oft-\textbf{S}parse \textbf{S}equence Learning framework, which systematically solves these challenges. A dual enhancement mechanism is proposed to enhance the modeling of weak, early signals. Then, an attention-based patch module is introduced to preserve discriminative information while reducing noise and complexity. A dual-path fusion architecture is designed, using a sparse mixture of experts to model local, subject-specific variations. A multi-scale inception module is also employed to capture global dependencies. Experiments on six real-world medical datasets show the competitive performance of DE3S, particularly in early prediction windows. Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of each component in addressing its targeted challenge.

| **[An Empirical Bayes approach to ARX Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13384v2)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Empirical Bayes inference is based on estimation of the parameters of an a priori distribution from the observed data. The estimation technique of the parameters of the prior, called hyperparameters, is based on the marginal distribution obtained by integrating the joint density of the model with respect to the prior. This is a key step which needs to be properly adapted to the problem at hand. In this paper we study Empirical Bayes inference of linear autoregressive models with inputs (ARX models) for time series and compare the performance of the marginal parametric estimator with that a full Empirical Bayesian analysis based on the estimated prior. Such a comparison, can only make sense for a (realistic) finite data length. In this setting, we propose a new estimation technique of the hyperparameters by a sequential Bayes procedure which is essentially a backward Kalman filter. It turns out that for finite data length the marginal Bayes tends to behave slightly better than the full Empirical Bayesian parameter estimator and so also in the case of slowly varying random parameters.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sundial: A Family of Highly Capable Time Series Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00816v3)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce Sundial, a family of native, flexible, and scalable time series foundation models. To predict the next-patch's distribution, we propose a TimeFlow Loss based on flow-matching, which facilitates native pre-training of Transformers on continuous-valued time series without discrete tokenization. Conditioned on arbitrary-length time series, our models are pre-trained without specifying any prior distribution and can generate multiple probable predictions, achieving more flexibility in representation learning than using parametric densities. Towards time series foundation models, we leverage minimal but crucial adaptations of Transformers and curate TimeBench with one trillion time points, comprising mostly real-world datasets and synthetic data. By mitigating mode collapse via TimeFlow Loss, we pre-train a family of Sundial models on TimeBench, which achieve unprecedented model capacity and generalization performance. In addition to excellent scalability, Sundial achieves state-of-the-art results on both point and probabilistic forecasting benchmarks with a just-in-time inference speed, i.e., making zero-shot predictions within a few milliseconds. We believe that Sundial's pioneering generative forecasting capability can improve model reliability in real-world decision-making.

| **[ReNF: Rethinking the Design Space of Neural Long-Term Time Series Forecasters](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25914v4)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural Forecasters (NFs) are a cornerstone of Long-term Time Series Forecasting (LTSF). However, progress has been hampered by an overemphasis on architectural complexity at the expense of fundamental forecasting principles. In this work, we return to first principles to redesign the LTSF paradigm. We begin by introducing a Multiple Neural Forecasting Theorem that provides a theoretical basis for our approach. We propose Boosted Direct Output (BDO), a novel forecasting strategy that synergistically combines the advantages of both Auto-Regressive (AR) and Direct Output (DO). In addition, we stabilize the learning process by smoothly tracking the model's parameters. Extensive experiments show that these principled improvements enable a simple MLP to achieve state-of-the-art performance, outperforming recent, complex models in nearly all cases, without any specific considerations in the area. Finally, we empirically verify our theorem, establishing a dynamic performance bound and identifying promising directions for future research.

| **[Efficient Linear Attention for Multivariate Time Series Modeling via Entropy Equality](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03190v1)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Attention mechanisms have been extensively employed in various applications, including time series modeling, owing to their capacity to capture intricate dependencies; however, their utility is often constrained by quadratic computational complexity, which impedes scalability for long sequences. In this work, we propose a novel linear attention mechanism designed to overcome these limitations. Our approach is grounded in a theoretical demonstration that entropy, as a strictly concave function on the probability simplex, implies that distributions with aligned probability rankings and similar entropy values exhibit structural resemblance. Building on this insight, we develop an efficient approximation algorithm that computes the entropy of dot-product-derived distributions with only linear complexity, enabling the implementation of a linear attention mechanism based on entropy equality. Through rigorous analysis, we reveal that the effectiveness of attention in spatio-temporal time series modeling may not primarily stem from the non-linearity of softmax but rather from the attainment of a moderate and well-balanced weight distribution. Extensive experiments on four spatio-temporal datasets validate our method, demonstrating competitive or superior forecasting performance while achieving substantial reductions in both memory usage and computational time.</p></details> |  |

Learned Graph Network Simulators (GNSs) offer a promising alternative to traditional mesh-based physics simulators. Their speed and inherent differentiability make them particularly well suited for applications that require fast and accurate simulations, such as robotic manipulation or manufacturing optimization. However, existing learned simulators typically rely on single-step observations, which limits their ability to exploit temporal context. Without this information, these models fail to infer, e.g., material properties. Further, they rely on auto-regressive rollouts, which quickly accumulate error for long trajectories. We instead frame mesh-based simulation as a trajectory-level meta-learning problem. Using Conditional Neural Processes, our method enables rapid adaptation to new simulation scenarios from limited initial data while capturing their latent simulation properties. We utilize movement primitives to directly predict fast, stable and accurate simulations from a single model call. The resulting approach, Movement-primitive Meta-MeshGraphNet (M3GN), provides higher simulation accuracy at a fraction of the runtime cost compared to state-of-the-art GNSs across several tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>35 pa...</summary><p>35 pages.

| **[Consistency Trajectory Matching for One-Step Generative Super-Resolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20349v5)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current diffusion-based super-resolution (SR) approaches achieve commendable performance at the cost of high inference overhead. Therefore, distillation techniques are utilized to accelerate the multi-step teacher model into one-step student model. Nevertheless, these methods significantly raise training costs and constrain the performance of the student model by the teacher model. To overcome these tough challenges, we propose Consistency Trajectory Matching for Super-Resolution (CTMSR), a distillation-free strategy that is able to generate photo-realistic SR results in one step. Concretely, we first formulate a Probability Flow Ordinary Differential Equation (PF-ODE) trajectory to establish a deterministic mapping from low-resolution (LR) images with noise to high-resolution (HR) images. Then we apply the Consistency Training (CT) strategy to directly learn the mapping in one step, eliminating the necessity of pre-trained diffusion model. To further enhance the performance and better leverage the ground-truth during the training process, we aim to align the distribution of SR results more closely with that of the natural images. To this end, we propose to minimize the discrepancy between their respective PF-ODE trajectories from the LR image distribution by our meticulously designed Distribution Trajectory Matching (DTM) loss, resulting in improved realism of our recovered HR images. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed methods can attain comparable or even superior capabilities on both synthetic and real datasets while maintaining minimal inference latency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICCV 2025</p></details> |

We present a novel Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)-based approach that enables systematic generalization from single-context demonstrations to a wide range of unseen start and goal configurations. Our method performs component-level reparameterization of the GMM, adapting both mean vectors and covariance matrices, followed by Gaussian Mixture Regression (GMR) to generate smooth trajectories. We evaluate the approach on a dual-arm pick-and-place task with varying box placements, comparing against several baselines. Results show that our method significantly outperforms baselines in trajectory success and fidelity, maintaining accuracy even under combined translational and rotational variations of task configurations. These results demonstrate that our method generalizes effectively while ensuring boundary convergence and preserving the intrinsic structure of demonstrated motions.</p></details> |  |

Recent studies have established global convergence for 2MLR with known balanced weights and super-linear convergence in noiseless and high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regimes. However, the theoretical behavior of EM in the fully unknown setting remains unclear, with its trajectory and convergence order not yet fully characterized. We derive explicit EM update expressions for 2MLR with unknown mixing weights and regression parameters across all SNR regimes and analyze their structural properties and cycloid trajectories. In the noiseless case, we prove that the trajectory of the regression parameters in EM iterations traces a cycloid by establishing a recurrence relation for the sub-optimality angle, while in high SNR regimes we quantify its discrepancy from the cycloid trajectory. The trajectory-based analysis reveals the order of convergence: linear when the EM estimate is nearly orthogonal to the ground truth, and quadratic when the angle between the estimate and ground truth is small at the population level. Our analysis establishes non-asymptotic guarantees by sharpening bounds on statistical errors between finite-sample and population EM updates, relating EM's statistical accuracy to the sub-optimality angle, and proving convergence with arbitrary initialization at the finite-sample level. This work provides a novel trajectory-based framework for analyzing EM in Mixed Linear Regression.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint of the paper submitted to IEEE Transactions on Information Theory</p></details> |

This research establishes a comprehensive, mathematically rigorous framework for trajectory prediction that moves beyond empirical modeling to a geomechanically-informed, data-driven surrogate approach.The study leverages Log ASCII Standard (LAS) and wellbore deviation (DEV) data from 14 wells in the Gulfaks oil field, treating petrophysical logs not merely as input features, but as proxies for the mechanical properties of the rock that fundamentally govern drilling dynamics. A key contribution of this work is the formal derivation of wellbore kinematic models, including the Average Angle method and Dogleg Severity, from the first principles of vector calculus and differential geometry, contextualizing them as robust numerical integration schemes. The core of the predictive model is a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) network, for which we provide a complete, step-by-step derivation of the forward propagation dynamics and the Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT) training algorithm. This detailed theoretical exposition, often omitted in applied studies, clarifies the mechanisms by which the network learns temporal dependencies. The methodology encompasses a theoretically justified data preprocessing pipeline, including feature normalization, uniform depth resampling, and sequence generation. Trajectory post-processing and error analysis are conducted using Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and the Coefficient of Determination (R2).</p></details> | 22 pages, 6 figures |

The new estimate is $O(N^{-1/2})$, with a constant related to the probability of success of the bound, given by Hoeffding's inequality, similar to other methodologies, such as Philipp et al. Furthermore, we propose a \textit{lifting back} operator to obtain trajectories generated by embedding the initial state and iterating a linear system in a higher dimension. This naturally yields an $O(N^{-1/2})$ error bound for mean trajectories. Finally, we show numerical results including an example of nonlinear system, exhibiting successful approximation with exponential decay faster than $-1/2$, as suggested by the theoretical results.</p></details> | 24 pages, 6 figures |

This limits the applicability of machine learning methods and the ability to perform large-scale simulations or "what-if" analyses. In this paper, we investigate whether generative models trained on data-rich airports can be efficiently adapted to data-scarce airports using transfer learning. We adapt state-of-the-art diffusion- and flow-matching-based architectures to the aviation domain and evaluate their transferability between Zurich (source) and Dublin (target) landing trajectory datasets. Models are pretrained on Zurich and fine-tuned on Dublin with varying amounts of local data, ranging from 0% to 100%. Results show that diffusion-based models achieve competitive performance with as little as 5% of the Dublin data and reach baseline-level performance around 20%, consistently outperforming models trained from scratch across metrics and visual inspections. Latent flow matching and latent diffusion models also benefit from pretraining, though with more variable gains, while flow matching models show weaker generalization. Despite challenges in capturing rare trajectory patterns, these findings demonstrate the potential of transfer learning to substantially reduce data requirements for trajectory generation in ATM, enabling realistic synthetic data generation even in environments with limited historical records.</p></details> |  |

A promising direction is to leverage the generalist knowledge and reasoning capabilities of large-language models by treating unusual driving scenarios as a logical reasoning task. In this work, we present Poutine, a method that uses an off-the-shelf 3B-parameter vision-language model (VLM) - without any additional components - to achieve robust end-to-end autonomous driving via a simple and scalable training recipe. To learn strong base driving capabilities, we first train Poutine-Base using self-supervised next-token prediction over vision, language, and trajectory (VLT) tokens, leveraging both nominal and long-tail driving data. In the second stage, we fine-tune Poutine-Base using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with a small set of human preference-labeled examples. We evaluated our approach on the Waymo end-to-end driving benchmark curated for long-tail scenarios. The final Poutine model achieves an RFS of 7.99 on the test set, placing 1st in the 2025 Waymo Vision-Based End-to-End Driving Challenge by a significant margin. Our results suggest that handcrafted tokenizers or custom architectural components added to base VLMs in prior work are not necessary to achieve strong driving performance. Instead, this work highlights the potential of scalable VLT pretraining combined with lightweight RL fine-tuning to enable robust and generalizable autonomous driving.</p></details> |  |

We introduce the task of anomaly detection in agentic trajectories to identify these failures and present a dataset curation pipeline that captures user behavior, agent non-determinism, and LLM variation. Using this pipeline, we curate and label two benchmark datasets comprising \textbf{4,275 and 894} trajectories from Multi-Agentic AI systems. Benchmarking anomaly detection methods on these datasets, we show that supervised (XGBoost) and semi-supervised (SVDD) approaches perform comparably, achieving accuracies up to 98% and 96%, respectively. This work provides the first systematic study of anomaly detection in Multi-Agentic AI systems, offering datasets, benchmarks, and insights to guide future research.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Framework for Human-Reason-Aligned Trajectory Evaluation in Automated Vehicles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23324v2)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>One major challenge for the adoption and acceptance of automated vehicles (AVs) is ensuring that they can make sound decisions in everyday situations that involve ethical tension. Much attention has focused on rare, high-stakes dilemmas such as trolley problems. Yet similar conflicts arise in routine driving when human considerations, such as legality, efficiency, and comfort, come into conflict. Current AV planning systems typically rely on rigid rules, which struggle to balance these competing considerations and often lead to behaviour that misaligns with human expectations. This paper introduces a reasons-based trajectory evaluation framework that operationalises the tracking condition of Meaningful Human Control (MHC). The framework represents human agents reasons (e.g., regulatory compliance) as quantifiable functions and evaluates how well candidate trajectories align with them. It assigns adjustable weights to agent priorities and includes a balance function to discourage excluding any agent. To demonstrate the approach, we use a real-world-inspired overtaking scenario, which highlights tensions between compliance, efficiency, and comfort. Our results show that different trajectories emerge as preferable depending on how agents reasons are weighted, and small shifts in priorities can lead to discrete changes in the selected action. This demonstrates that everyday ethical decisions in AV driving are highly sensitive to the weights assigned to the reasons of different human agents.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This version incorporates revisions based on peer-review feedback from a new submission.

| **[Optimizing Earth-Moon Transfer and Cislunar Navigation: Integrating Low-Energy Trajectories, AI Techniques and GNSS-R Technologies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03173v1)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid growth of cislunar activities, including lunar landings, the Lunar Gateway, and in-space refueling stations, requires advances in cost-efficient trajectory design and reliable integration of navigation and remote sensing. Traditional Earth-Moon transfers suffer from rigid launch windows and high propellant demands, while Earth-based GNSS systems provide little to no coverage beyond geostationary orbit. This limits autonomy and environmental awareness in cislunar space. This review compares four major transfer strategies by evaluating velocity requirements, flight durations, and fuel efficiency, and by identifying their suitability for both crewed and robotic missions. The emerging role of artificial intelligence and machine learning is highlighted: convolutional neural networks support automated crater recognition and digital terrain model generation, while deep reinforcement learning enables adaptive trajectory refinement during descent and landing to reduce risk and decision latency. The study also examines how GNSS-Reflectometry and advanced Positioning, Navigation, and Timing architectures can extend navigation capabilities beyond current limits. GNSS-R can act as a bistatic radar for mapping lunar ice, soil properties, and surface topography, while PNT systems support autonomous rendezvous, Lagrange point station-keeping, and coordinated satellite swarm operations. Combining these developments establishes a scalable framework for sustainable cislunar exploration and long-term human and robotic presence.</p></details> |  |

The motion planning of this system faces challenges due to the interactions between the cable's state transitions, the trailer's nonholonomic constraints, and the system's underactuation. To address these challenges, we first develop a hybrid dynamics model that captures the cable's taut and slack states. A search algorithm is then introduced to compute a suboptimal trajectory while incorporating mode transitions. Additionally, we propose a novel collision avoidance constraint based on geometric polygons to formulate the trajectory optimization problem for the hybrid system. The proposed method is implemented on a Unitree A1 quadruped robot with a customized cable-trailer and validated through experiments. The real system demonstrates both agile and safe motion with cable mode transitions.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 8 figures, Accept by RA-L 2025</p></details> |
| **[Deep Learning Warm Starts for Trajectory Optimization on the International Space Station](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05588v3)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory optimization is a cornerstone of modern robot autonomy, enabling systems to compute trajectories and controls in real-time while respecting safety and physical constraints. However, it has seen limited usage in spaceflight applications due to its heavy computational demands that exceed the capability of most flight computers. In this work, we provide results on the first in-space demonstration of using machine learning-based warm starts for accelerating trajectory optimization for the Astrobee free-flying robot onboard the International Space Station (ISS). We formulate a data-driven optimal control approach that trains a neural network to learn the structure of the trajectory generation problem being solved using sequential convex programming (SCP). Onboard, this trained neural network predicts solutions for the trajectory generation problem and relies on using the SCP solver to enforce safety constraints for the system. Our trained network reduces the number of solver iterations required for convergence in cases including rotational dynamics by 60% and in cases with obstacles drawn from the training distribution of the warm start model by 50%. This work represents a significant milestone in the use of learning-based control for spaceflight applications and a stepping stone for future advances in the use of machine learning for autonomous guidance, navigation, & control.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to 2025 International Conference on Space Robotics (iSpaRo).

| **[Curriculum Design for Trajectory-Constrained Agent: Compressing Chain-of-Thought Tokens in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02690v1)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Training agents to operate under strict constraints during deployment, such as limited resource budgets or stringent safety requirements, presents significant challenges, especially when these constraints render the task complex. In this work, we propose a curriculum learning strategy that gradually tightens constraints during training, enabling the agent to incrementally master the deployment requirements. Inspired by self-paced learning techniques in unconstrained reinforcement learning (RL), our approach facilitates a smoother transition to challenging environments by initially training on simplified versions of the constraints and progressively introducing the full deployment conditions. We provide a theoretical analysis using an RL agent in a binary-tree Markov Decision Process (MDP) to demonstrate that our curriculum strategy can accelerate training relative to a baseline approach that imposes the trajectory constraints from the outset. Moreover, we empirically validate the effectiveness and generality of our method across both RL and large language model (LLM) agents in diverse settings, including a binary-tree MDP, a multi-task navigation domain, and a math reasoning task with two benchmarks. These results highlight the potential of curriculum design in enhancing the efficiency and performance of agents operating under complex trajectory constraints during deployment. Moreover, when applied to LLMs, our strategy enables compression of output chain-of-thought tokens, achieving a substantial inference speedup on consumer hardware, demonstrating its effectiveness for resource-constrained deployment.</p></details> | NeurIPS'25 paper |
| **[Virtual Target Trajectory Prediction for Stochastic Targets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01851v2)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction of aerial vehicles is a key requirement in applications ranging from missile guidance to UAV collision avoidance. While most prediction methods assume deterministic target motion, real-world targets often exhibit stochastic behaviors such as evasive maneuvers or random gliding patterns. This paper introduces a probabilistic framework based on Conditional Normalizing Flows (CNFs) to model and predict such stochastic dynamics directly from trajectory data. The learned model generates probability distributions of future target positions conditioned on initial states and dynamic parameters, enabling efficient sampling and exact density evaluation. To provide deterministic surrogates compatible with existing guidance and planning algorithms, sampled trajectories are clustered using a time series k-means approach, yielding a set of representative "virtual target" trajectories. The method is target-agnostic, computationally efficient, and requires only trajectory data for training, making it suitable as a drop-in replacement for deterministic predictors. Simulated scenarios with maneuvering and ballistic targets demonstrate that the proposed approach bridges the gap between deterministic assumptions and stochastic reality, advancing guidance and control algorithms for autonomous vehicles.</p></details> | <details><summary>Manus...</summary><p>Manuscript accepted by Journal of Guidance, Control, and Dynamics</p></details> |
| **[Towards Predicting Any Human Trajectory In Context](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00871v3)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predicting accurate future trajectories of pedestrians is essential for autonomous systems but remains a challenging task due to the need for adaptability in different environments and domains. A common approach involves collecting scenario-specific data and performing fine-tuning via backpropagation. However, the need to fine-tune for each new scenario is often impractical for deployment on edge devices. To address this challenge, we introduce TrajICL, an In-Context Learning (ICL) framework for pedestrian trajectory prediction that enables adaptation without fine-tuning on the scenario-specific data at inference time without requiring weight updates. We propose a spatio-temporal similarity-based example selection (STES) method that selects relevant examples from previously observed trajectories within the same scene by identifying similar motion patterns at corresponding locations. To further refine this selection, we introduce prediction-guided example selection (PG-ES), which selects examples based on both the past trajectory and the predicted future trajectory, rather than relying solely on the past trajectory. This approach allows the model to account for long-term dynamics when selecting examples. Finally, instead of relying on small real-world datasets with limited scenario diversity, we train our model on a large-scale synthetic dataset to enhance its prediction ability by leveraging in-context examples. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TrajICL achieves remarkable adaptation across both in-domain and cross-domain scenarios, outperforming even fine-tuned approaches across multiple public benchmarks.

| **[From Instance Segmentation to 3D Growth Trajectory Reconstruction in Planktonic Foraminifera](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02142v1)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Planktonic foraminifera, marine protists characterized by their intricate chambered shells, serve as valuable indicators of past and present environmental conditions. Understanding their chamber growth trajectory provides crucial insights into organismal development and ecological adaptation under changing environments. However, automated tracing of chamber growth from imaging data remains largely unexplored, with existing approaches relying heavily on manual segmentation of each chamber, which is time-consuming and subjective. In this study, we propose an end-to-end pipeline that integrates instance segmentation, a computer vision technique not extensively explored in foraminifera, with a dedicated chamber ordering algorithm to automatically reconstruct three-dimensional growth trajectories from high-resolution computed tomography scans. We quantitatively and qualitatively evaluate multiple instance segmentation methods, each optimized for distinct spatial features of the chambers, and examine their downstream influence on growth-order reconstruction accuracy. Experimental results on expert-annotated datasets demonstrate that the proposed pipeline substantially reduces manual effort while maintaining biologically meaningful accuracy. Although segmentation models exhibit under-segmentation in smaller chambers due to reduced voxel fidelity and subtle inter-chamber connectivity, the chamber-ordering algorithm remains robust, achieving consistent reconstruction of developmental trajectories even under partial segmentation. This work provides the first fully automated and reproducible pipeline for digital foraminiferal growth analysis, establishing a foundation for large-scale, data-driven ecological studies.</p></details> |  |
| **[TACO: Trajectory-Aware Controller Optimization for Quadrotors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02060v1)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Controller performance in quadrotor trajectory tracking depends heavily on parameter tuning, yet standard approaches often rely on fixed, manually tuned parameters that sacrifice task-specific performance. We present Trajectory-Aware Controller Optimization (TACO), a framework that adapts controller parameters online based on the upcoming reference trajectory and current quadrotor state. TACO employs a learned predictive model and a lightweight optimization scheme to optimize controller gains in real time with respect to a broad class of trajectories, and can also be used to adapt trajectories to improve dynamic feasibility while respecting smoothness constraints. To enable large-scale training, we also introduce a parallelized quadrotor simulator supporting fast data collection on diverse trajectories. Experiments on a variety of trajectory types show that TACO outperforms conventional, static parameter tuning while operating orders of magnitude faster than black-box optimization baselines, enabling practical real-time deployment on a physical quadrotor. Furthermore, we show that adapting trajectories using TACO significantly reduces the tracking error obtained by the quadrotor.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 6 figures.

| **[TraCS: Trajectory Collection in Continuous Space under Local Differential Privacy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00620v2)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory collection is fundamental for location-based services but often involves sensitive information, such as users' daily activities, raising significant privacy concerns. Local Differential Privacy (LDP) provides strong privacy guarantees for users, even when the data collector is untrusted. Existing trajectory collection methods under LDP are limited to discrete location spaces, where the number of locations affects both privacy guarantees and trajectory utility. Moreover, many real-world scenarios, such as flying trajectories or sensor trajectories of wearable devices, operate in continuous location spaces, making existing methods inadequate. This paper shifts the focus from discrete to continuous spaces for trajectory collection under LDP. We propose two novel methods: TraCS-D, which perturbs the direction and distance of locations, and TraCS-C, which perturbs the Cartesian coordinates of locations. Both methods are theoretically and experimentally analyzed for trajectory utility in continuous spaces. TraCS can also be applied to discrete spaces by rounding perturbed locations to the nearest discrete points. In this case, TraCS's privacy and utility guarantees are independent of the number of locations in the space, and has only $\Theta(1)$ time complexity in each perturbation generation. Evaluation results on discrete location spaces validate the efficiency advantage and show that TraCS outperforms state-of-the-art methods with improved trajectory utility, especially for large privacy parameters.</p></details> |  |
| **[SE-Agent: Self-Evolution Trajectory Optimization in Multi-Step Reasoning with LLM-Based Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02085v6)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents have recently shown impressive capabilities in complex reasoning and tool use via multi-step interactions with their environments. While these agents have the potential to tackle complicated tasks, their problem-solving process, i.e., agents' interaction trajectory leading to task completion, remains underexploited. These trajectories contain rich feedback that can navigate agents toward the right directions for solving problems correctly. Although prevailing approaches, such as Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), can effectively balance exploration and exploitation, they ignore the interdependence among various trajectories and lack the diversity of search spaces, which leads to redundant reasoning and suboptimal outcomes. To address these challenges, we propose SE-Agent, a Self-Evolution framework that enables Agents to optimize their reasoning processes iteratively. Our approach revisits and enhances former pilot trajectories through three key operations: revision, recombination, and refinement. This evolutionary mechanism enables two critical advantages: (1) it expands the search space beyond local optima by intelligently exploring diverse solution paths guided by previous trajectories, and (2) it leverages cross-trajectory inspiration to efficiently enhance performance while mitigating the impact of suboptimal reasoning paths. Through these mechanisms, SE-Agent achieves continuous self-evolution that incrementally improves reasoning quality. We evaluate SE-Agent on SWE-bench Verified to resolve real-world GitHub issues. Experimental results across five strong LLMs show that integrating SE-Agent delivers up to 55% relative improvement, achieving state-of-the-art performance among all open-source agents on SWE-bench Verified. Our code and demonstration materials are publicly available at https://github.com/JARVIS-Xs/SE-Agent.</p></details> |  |

However, comprehensive datasets that capture real-world career trajectories are scarce. In this paper, we introduce JobHop, a large-scale public dataset derived from anonymized resumes provided by VDAB, the public employment service in Flanders, Belgium. Utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs), we process unstructured resume data to extract structured career information, which is then normalized to standardized ESCO occupation codes using a multi-label classification model. This results in a rich dataset of over 1.67 million work experiences, extracted from and grouped into more than 361,000 user resumes and mapped to standardized ESCO occupation codes, offering valuable insights into real-world occupational transitions. This dataset enables diverse applications, such as analyzing labor market mobility, job stability, and the effects of career breaks on occupational transitions. It also supports career path prediction and other data-driven decision-making processes. To illustrate its potential, we explore key dataset characteristics, including job distributions, career breaks, and job transitions, demonstrating its value for advancing labor market research.</p></details> |  |
| **[HGFreNet: Hop-hybrid GraphFomer for 3D Human Pose Estimation with Trajectory Consistency in Frequency Domain](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01756v1)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>2D-to-3D human pose lifting is a fundamental challenge for 3D human pose estimation in monocular video, where graph convolutional networks (GCNs) and attention mechanisms have proven to be inherently suitable for encoding the spatial-temporal correlations of skeletal joints. However, depth ambiguity and errors in 2D pose estimation lead to incoherence in the 3D trajectory. Previous studies have attempted to restrict jitters in the time domain, for instance, by constraining the differences between adjacent frames while neglecting the global spatial-temporal correlations of skeletal joint motion. To tackle this problem, we design HGFreNet, a novel GraphFormer architecture with hop-hybrid feature aggregation and 3D trajectory consistency in the frequency domain. Specifically, we propose a hop-hybrid graph attention (HGA) module and a Transformer encoder to model global joint spatial-temporal correlations. The HGA module groups all $k$-hop neighbors of a skeletal joint into a hybrid group to enlarge the receptive field and applies the attention mechanism to discover the latent correlations of these groups globally. We then exploit global temporal correlations by constraining trajectory consistency in the frequency domain. To provide 3D information for depth inference across frames and maintain coherence over time, a preliminary network is applied to estimate the 3D pose. Extensive experiments were conducted on two standard benchmark datasets: Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP. The results demonstrate that the proposed HGFreNet outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in terms of positional accuracy and temporal consistency.</p></details> |  |

This paper presents a lightweight large language model-based multimodal flight delay prediction, formulated from the perspective of air traffic controllers monitoring aircraft delay after entering the terminal area. The approach integrates trajectory representations with textual aeronautical information, including flight information, weather reports, and aerodrome notices, by adapting trajectory data into the language modality to capture airspace conditions. The experiments show that the model consistently achieves sub-minute prediction error by effectively leveraging contextual information related to the sources of delay, fulfilling the operational standard for minute-level precision. The framework demonstrates that linguistic understanding, when combined with cross-modality adaptation of trajectory data, enhances delay prediction. Moreover, the approach shows practicality and potential scalability for real-world operations, supporting real-time updates that refine predictions upon receiving new operational information.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint submitted to Aerospace Science and Technology (Elsevier) for possible publication</p></details> |

While experimental techniques like spatial transcriptomics now enable high-resolution mapping of tissue organization across space and time, current methods that model cellular evolution operate at the single-cell level, overlooking the coordinated development of cellular states in a tissue. We introduce NicheFlow, a flow-based generative model that infers the temporal trajectory of cellular microenvironments across sequential spatial slides. By representing local cell neighborhoods as point clouds, NicheFlow jointly models the evolution of cell states and spatial coordinates using optimal transport and Variational Flow Matching. Our approach successfully recovers both global spatial architecture and local microenvironment composition across diverse spatiotemporal datasets, from embryonic to brain development.</p></details> | <details><summary>37 pa...</summary><p>37 pages, 15 figures, to appear in NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

Exiting efforts focus on single-frame cooperative perception, however, how to capture the temporal cue between frames with V2X to facilitate the prediction task even the planning task is still underexplored. In this paper, we introduce the Co-MTP, a general cooperative trajectory prediction framework with multi-temporal fusion for autonomous driving, which leverages the V2X system to fully capture the interaction among agents in both history and future domains to benefit the planning. In the history domain, V2X can complement the incomplete history trajectory in single-vehicle perception, and we design a heterogeneous graph transformer to learn the fusion of the history feature from multiple agents and capture the history interaction. Moreover, the goal of prediction is to support future planning. Thus, in the future domain, V2X can provide the prediction results of surrounding objects, and we further extend the graph transformer to capture the future interaction among the ego planning and the other vehicles' intentions and obtain the final future scenario state under a certain planning action. We evaluate the Co-MTP framework on the real-world dataset V2X-Seq, and the results show that Co-MTP achieves state-of-the-art performance and that both history and future fusion can greatly benefit prediction.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 3 figures, ICRA 2025</p></details> |
| **[Dynamic Population Distribution Aware Human Trajectory Generation with Diffusion Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01929v1)** | 2025-11-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human trajectory data is crucial in urban planning, traffic engineering, and public health. However, directly using real-world trajectory data often faces challenges such as privacy concerns, data acquisition costs, and data quality. A practical solution to these challenges is trajectory generation, a method developed to simulate human mobility behaviors. Existing trajectory generation methods mainly focus on capturing individual movement patterns but often overlook the influence of population distribution on trajectory generation. In reality, dynamic population distribution reflects changes in population density across different regions, significantly impacting individual mobility behavior. Thus, we propose a novel trajectory generation framework based on a diffusion model, which integrates the dynamic population distribution constraints to guide high-fidelity generation outcomes. Specifically, we construct a spatial graph to enhance the spatial correlation of trajectories. Then, we design a dynamic population distribution aware denoising network to capture the spatiotemporal dependencies of human mobility behavior as well as the impact of population distribution in the denoising process. Extensive experiments show that the trajectories generated by our model can resemble real-world trajectories in terms of some critical statistical metrics, outperforming state-of-the-art algorithms by over 54%.</p></details> |  |
| **[ACTIVE: Continuous Similarity Search for Vessel Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01142v3)** | 2025-11-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Publicly available vessel trajectory data is emitted continuously from the global AIS system. Continuous trajectory similarity search on this data has applications in, e.g., maritime navigation and safety. Existing proposals typically assume an offline setting and focus on finding similarities between complete trajectories. Such proposals are less effective when applied to online scenarios, where similarity comparisons must be performed continuously as new trajectory data arrives and trajectories evolve. We therefore propose a real-time continuous trajectory similarity search method for vessels (ACTIVE). We introduce a novel similarity measure, object-trajectory real-time distance, that emphasizes the anticipated future movement trends of vessels, enabling more predictive and forward-looking comparisons. Next, we propose an efficient continuous similar trajectory search (CSTS) algorithm together with a segment-based vessel trajectory index and a variety of search space pruning strategies that reduce unnecessary computations during the continuous similarity search, thereby further improving efficiency. Extensive experiments on two large real-world AIS datasets offer evidence that ACTIVE is capable of outperforming state-of-the-art methods considerably. ACTIVE significantly reduces index construction costs and index size while achieving a 70% reduction in terms of query time and a 60% increase in terms of hit rate.</p></details> |  |
| **[SOCRATES: Simulation Optimization with Correlated Replicas and Adaptive Trajectory Evaluations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00685v1)** | 2025-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The field of simulation optimization (SO) encompasses various methods developed to optimize complex, expensive-to-sample stochastic systems. Established methods include, but are not limited to, ranking-and-selection for finite alternatives and surrogate-based methods for continuous domains, with broad applications in engineering and operations management. The recent advent of large language models (LLMs) offers a new paradigm for exploiting system structure and automating the strategic selection and composition of these established SO methods into a tailored optimization procedure. This work introduces SOCRATES (Simulation Optimization with Correlated Replicas and Adaptive Trajectory Evaluations), a novel two-stage procedure that leverages LLMs to automate the design of tailored SO algorithms. The first stage constructs an ensemble of digital replicas of the real system. An LLM is employed to implement causal discovery from a textual description of the system, generating a structural `skeleton' that guides the sample-efficient learning of the replicas. In the second stage, this replica ensemble is used as an inexpensive testbed to evaluate a set of baseline SO algorithms. An LLM then acts as a meta-optimizer, analyzing the performance trajectories of these algorithms to iteratively revise and compose a final, hybrid optimization schedule. This schedule is designed to be adaptive, with the ability to be updated during the final execution on the real system when the optimization performance deviates from expectations. By integrating LLM-driven reasoning with LLM-assisted trajectory-aware meta-optimization, SOCRATES creates an effective and sample-efficient solution for complex SO optimization problems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning an Efficient Optimizer via Hybrid-Policy Sub-Trajectory Balance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00543v1)** | 2025-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in generative modeling enable neural networks to generate weights without relying on gradient-based optimization. However, current methods are limited by issues of over-coupling and long-horizon. The former tightly binds weight generation with task-specific objectives, thereby limiting the flexibility of the learned optimizer. The latter leads to inefficiency and low accuracy during inference, caused by the lack of local constraints. In this paper, we propose Lo-Hp, a decoupled two-stage weight generation framework that enhances flexibility through learning various optimization policies. It adopts a hybrid-policy sub-trajectory balance objective, which integrates on-policy and off-policy learning to capture local optimization policies. Theoretically, we demonstrate that learning solely local optimization policies can address the long-horizon issue while enhancing the generation of global optimal weights. In addition, we validate Lo-Hp's superior accuracy and inference efficiency in tasks that require frequent weight updates, such as transfer learning, few-shot learning, domain generalization, and large language model adaptation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Listwise Preference Diffusion Optimization for User Behavior Trajectories Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00530v1)** | 2025-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Forecasting multi-step user behavior trajectories requires reasoning over structured preferences across future actions, a challenge overlooked by traditional sequential recommendation. This problem is critical for applications such as personalized commerce and adaptive content delivery, where anticipating a user's complete action sequence enhances both satisfaction and business outcomes. We identify an essential limitation of existing paradigms: their inability to capture global, listwise dependencies among sequence items. To address this, we formulate User Behavior Trajectory Prediction (UBTP) as a new task setting that explicitly models long-term user preferences. We introduce Listwise Preference Diffusion Optimization (LPDO), a diffusion-based training framework that directly optimizes structured preferences over entire item sequences. LPDO incorporates a Plackett-Luce supervision signal and derives a tight variational lower bound aligned with listwise ranking likelihoods, enabling coherent preference generation across denoising steps and overcoming the independent-token assumption of prior diffusion methods. To rigorously evaluate multi-step prediction quality, we propose the task-specific metric Sequential Match (SeqMatch), which measures exact trajectory agreement, and adopt Perplexity (PPL), which assesses probabilistic fidelity. Extensive experiments on real-world user behavior benchmarks demonstrate that LPDO consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, establishing a new benchmark for structured preference learning with diffusion models.</p></details> |  |
| **[OmniTrack++: Omnidirectional Multi-Object Tracking by Learning Large-FoV Trajectory Feedback](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00510v1)** | 2025-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper investigates Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) in panoramic imagery, which introduces unique challenges including a 360{\deg} Field of View (FoV), resolution dilution, and severe view-dependent distortions. Conventional MOT methods designed for narrow-FoV pinhole cameras generalize unsatisfactorily under these conditions. To address panoramic distortion, large search space, and identity ambiguity under a 360{\deg} FoV, OmniTrack++ adopts a feedback-driven framework that progressively refines perception with trajectory cues. A DynamicSSM block first stabilizes panoramic features, implicitly alleviating geometric distortion. On top of normalized representations, FlexiTrack Instances use trajectory-informed feedback for flexible localization and reliable short-term association. To ensure long-term robustness, an ExpertTrack Memory consolidates appearance cues via a Mixture-of-Experts design, enabling recovery from fragmented tracks and reducing identity drift. Finally, a Tracklet Management module adaptively switches between end-to-end and tracking-by-detection modes according to scene dynamics, offering a balanced and scalable solution for panoramic MOT. To support rigorous evaluation, we establish the EmboTrack benchmark, a comprehensive dataset for panoramic MOT that includes QuadTrack, captured with a quadruped robot, and BipTrack, collected with a bipedal wheel-legged robot. Together, these datasets span wide-angle environments and diverse motion patterns, providing a challenging testbed for real-world panoramic perception. Extensive experiments on JRDB and EmboTrack demonstrate that OmniTrack++ achieves state-of-the-art performance, yielding substantial HOTA improvements of +25.5% on JRDB and +43.07% on QuadTrack over the original OmniTrack.

In this paper, we enhance high-frequency features of GEO targets while suppressing background noise at the single-frame level through wavelet transform. Building on this, we propose a multi-frame temporal trajectory completion scheme centered on the Hungarian algorithm for globally optimal cross-frame matching. To effectively mitigate missing and false detections, a series of key steps including temporal matching and interpolation completion, temporal-consistency-based noise filtering, and progressive trajectory refinement are designed in the post-processing pipeline. Experimental results on the public SpotGEO dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, achieving an F_1 score of 90.14%.</p></details> |  |

Most novice programmer bugs are caused by programming misconceptions, namely false beliefs about a programming concept. In this context, Socratic debugging can be formulated as a guided Reasoning Trajectory (RT) leading to a statement about the program behavior that contradicts the bug-causing misconception. Upon reaching this statement, the ensuing cognitive dissonance leads the student to first identify and then update their false belief. In this paper, we introduce the task of reasoning trajectory generation, together with a dataset of debugging problems manually annotated with RTs. We then describe LLM-based solutions for generating RTs and Socratic conversations that are anchored on them. A large-scale LLM-as-judge evaluation shows that frontier models can generate up to 91% correct reasoning trajectories and 98.7% valid conversation turns.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 2 tables, 13 figures</p></details> |

These improvements make xLSTM suitable for time-series prediction tasks as they exhibit the ability to model long-term temporal dependencies better than LSTMs. Despite their potential, these xLSTM-based models remain largely unexplored in the context of vehicle trajectory prediction. Therefore, this paper introduces a novel xLSTM-based vehicle trajectory prediction framework, X-TRAJ, and its physics-aware variant, X-TRACK (eXtended LSTM for TRAjectory prediction Constraint by Kinematics), which explicitly integrates vehicle motion kinematics into the model learning process. By introducing physical constraints, the proposed model generates realistic and feasible trajectories. A comprehensive evaluation on the highD and NGSIM datasets demonstrates that X-TRACK outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Understanding Code Agent Behaviour: An Empirical Study of Success and Failure Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00197v1)** | 2025-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The increasing deployment of Large Language Model (LLM) agents for complex software engineering tasks has created a need to understand their problem-solving behaviours beyond simple success metrics. While these agents demonstrate impressive capabilities in automated issue resolution, their decision-making processes remain largely opaque. This paper presents an empirical study of agent trajectories, namely the execution traces capturing the steps agents take when attempting to resolve software issues. We analyse trajectories from three state-of-the-art code agents (OpenHands, SWE-agent, and Prometheus) on the SWE-Bench benchmark, examining both successful and failed attempts. Our investigation reveals several key insights into agent behaviour. First, we identify how distinct problem-solving strategies, such as defensive programming and context gathering, enable success in different scenarios. Second, we find that failed trajectories are consistently longer and exhibit higher variance than successful ones, with failure patterns differing significantly between agents. Third, our fault localisation analysis shows that while most trajectories correctly identify problematic files (72-81\% even in failures), success depends more on achieving approximate rather than exact code modifications. These and other findings unveiled by our study, provide a foundation for understanding agent behaviour through trajectory analysis, contributing to the development of more robust and interpretable autonomous software engineering systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dynamic Model Selection for Trajectory Prediction via Pairwise Ranking and Meta-Features](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00126v1)** | 2025-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent deep trajectory predictors (e.g., Jiang et al., 2023; Zhou et al., 2022) have achieved strong average accuracy but remain unreliable in complex long-tail driving scenarios. These limitations reveal the weakness of the prevailing "one-model-fits-all" paradigm, particularly in safety-critical urban contexts where simpler physics-based models can occasionally outperform advanced networks (Kalman, 1960). To bridge this gap, we propose a dynamic multi-expert gating framework that adaptively selects the most reliable trajectory predictor among a physics-informed LSTM, a Transformer, and a fine-tuned GameFormer on a per-sample basis. Our method leverages internal model signals (meta-features) such as stability and uncertainty (Gal and Ghahramani, 2016), which we demonstrate to be substantially more informative than geometric scene descriptors. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to formulate trajectory expert selection as a pairwise-ranking problem over internal model signals (Burges et al., 2005), directly optimizing decision quality without requiring post-hoc calibration. Evaluated on the nuPlan-mini dataset (Caesar et al., 2021) with 1,287 samples, our LLM-enhanced tri-expert gate achieves a Final Displacement Error (FDE) of 2.567 m, representing a 9.5 percent reduction over GameFormer (2.835 m), and realizes 57.8 percent of the oracle performance bound. In open-loop simulations, after trajectory horizon alignment, the same configuration reduces FDE on left-turn scenarios by approximately 10 percent, demonstrating consistent improvements across both offline validation and open-loop evaluation. These results indicate that adaptive hybrid systems enhance trajectory reliability in safety-critical autonomous driving, providing a practical pathway beyond static single-model paradigms.</p></details> |  |
| **[EF-3DGS: Event-Aided Free-Trajectory 3D Gaussian Splatting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15392v4)** | 2025-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scene reconstruction from casually captured videos has wide applications in real-world scenarios. With recent advancements in differentiable rendering techniques, several methods have attempted to simultaneously optimize scene representations (NeRF or 3DGS) and camera poses. Despite recent progress, existing methods relying on traditional camera input tend to fail in high-speed (or equivalently low-frame-rate) scenarios. Event cameras, inspired by biological vision, record pixel-wise intensity changes asynchronously with high temporal resolution, providing valuable scene and motion information in blind inter-frame intervals. In this paper, we introduce the event camera to aid scene construction from a casually captured video for the first time, and propose Event-Aided Free-Trajectory 3DGS, called EF-3DGS, which seamlessly integrates the advantages of event cameras into 3DGS through three key components. First, we leverage the Event Generation Model (EGM) to fuse events and frames, supervising the rendered views observed by the event stream. Second, we adopt the Contrast Maximization (CMax) framework in a piece-wise manner to extract motion information by maximizing the contrast of the Image of Warped Events (IWE), thereby calibrating the estimated poses. Besides, based on the Linear Event Generation Model (LEGM), the brightness information encoded in the IWE is also utilized to constrain the 3DGS in the gradient domain. Third, to mitigate the absence of color information of events, we introduce photometric bundle adjustment (PBA) to ensure view consistency across events and frames. We evaluate our method on the public Tanks and Temples benchmark and a newly collected real-world dataset, RealEv-DAVIS.

| **[A composition of simplified physics-based model with neural operator for trajectory-level seismic response predictions of structural systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10569v2)** | 2025-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate prediction of nonlinear structural responses is essential for earthquake risk assessment and management. While high-fidelity nonlinear time history analysis provides the most comprehensive and accurate representation of the responses, it becomes computationally prohibitive for complex structural system models and repeated simulations under varying ground motions. To address this challenge, we propose a composite learning framework that integrates simplified physics-based models with a Fourier neural operator to enable efficient and accurate trajectory-level seismic response prediction. In the proposed architecture, a simplified physics-based model, obtained from techniques such as linearization, modal reduction, or solver relaxation, serves as a preprocessing operator to generate structural response trajectories that capture coarse dynamic characteristics. A neural operator is then trained to correct the discrepancy between these initial approximations and the true nonlinear responses, allowing the composite model to capture hysteretic and path-dependent behaviors. Additionally, a linear regression-based postprocessing scheme is introduced to further refine predictions and quantify associated uncertainty with negligible additional computational effort. The proposed approach is validated on three representative structural systems subjected to synthetic or recorded ground motions. Results show that the proposed approach consistently improves prediction accuracy over baseline models, particularly in data-scarce regimes. These findings demonstrate the potential of physics-guided operator learning for reliable and data-efficient modeling of nonlinear structural seismic responses.</p></details> |  |

Due to the complexity of the task and the high cost associated with manual annotation, previous approaches resort to disjoint training strategies, potentially leading to suboptimal performance. To circumvent this issue, we propose to generate captions about spatio-temporally localized entities leveraging a state-of-the-art VLM. By extending the LVIS and LV-VIS datasets with our synthetic captions (LVISCap and LV-VISCap), we train MaskCaptioner, an end-to-end model capable of jointly detecting, segmenting, tracking and captioning object trajectories. Moreover, with pretraining on LVISCap and LV-VISCap, MaskCaptioner achieves state-of-the-art DVOC results on three existing benchmarks, VidSTG, VLN and BenSMOT. The datasets and code are available at https://www.gabriel.fiastre.fr/maskcaptioner/.</p></details> | 20 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Wasserstein Regression as a Variational Approximation of Probabilistic Trajectories through the Bernstein Basis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26607v1)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper considers the problem of regression over distributions, which is becoming increasingly important in machine learning. Existing approaches often ignore the geometry of the probability space or are computationally expensive. To overcome these limitations, a new method is proposed that combines the parameterization of probability trajectories using a Bernstein basis and the minimization of the Wasserstein distance between distributions. The key idea is to model a conditional distribution as a smooth probability trajectory defined by a weighted sum of Gaussian components whose parameters -- the mean and covariance -- are functions of the input variable constructed using Bernstein polynomials. The loss function is the averaged squared Wasserstein distance between the predicted Gaussian distributions and the empirical data, which takes into account the geometry of the distributions. An autodiff-based optimization method is used to train the model. Experiments on synthetic datasets that include complex trajectories demonstrated that the proposed method provides competitive approximation quality in terms of the Wasserstein distance, Energy Distance, and RMSE metrics, especially in cases of pronounced nonlinearity. The model demonstrates trajectory smoothness that is better than or comparable to alternatives and robustness to changes in data structure, while maintaining high interpretability due to explicit parameterization via control points. The developed approach represents a balanced solution that combines geometric accuracy, computational practicality, and interpretability. Prospects for further research include extending the method to non-Gaussian distributions, applying entropy regularization to speed up computations, and adapting the approach to working with high-dimensional data for approximating surfaces and more complex structures.</p></details> |  |

Cameras are a promising tool for localization in logistics warehouses since they also offer valuable environmental contexts such as package status. However, identifying individuals with only visual data is often impractical. Accordingly, several prior studies identified people in videos by comparing their trajectories and wearable sensor measurements. While this approach has advantages such as independence from appearance, the existing methods may break down under real-world conditions. To overcome this challenge, we propose CorVS, a novel data-driven person identification method based on correspondence between visual tracking trajectories and sensor measurements. Firstly, our deep learning model predicts correspondence probabilities and reliabilities for every pair of a trajectory and sensor measurements. Secondly, our algorithm matches the trajectories and sensor measurements over time using the predicted probabilities and reliabilities. We developed a dataset with actual warehouse operations and demonstrated the method's effectiveness for real-world applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 3 figures, accepted to IPIN 2025</p></details> |
| **[Beyond Imitation: Constraint-Aware Trajectory Generation with Flow Matching For End-to-End Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26292v1)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Planning is a critical component of end-to-end autonomous driving. However, prevailing imitation learning methods often suffer from mode collapse, failing to produce diverse trajectory hypotheses. Meanwhile, existing generative approaches struggle to incorporate crucial safety and physical constraints directly into the generative process, necessitating an additional optimization stage to refine their outputs. To address these limitations, we propose CATG, a novel planning framework that leverages Constrained Flow Matching. Concretely, CATG explicitly models the flow matching process, which inherently mitigates mode collapse and allows for flexible guidance from various conditioning signals. Our primary contribution is the novel imposition of explicit constraints directly within the flow matching process, ensuring that the generated trajectories adhere to vital safety and kinematic rules. Secondly, CATG parameterizes driving aggressiveness as a control signal during generation, enabling precise manipulation of trajectory style. Notably, on the NavSim v2 challenge, CATG achieved 2nd place with an EPDMS score of 51.31 and was honored with the Innovation Award.</p></details> |  |
| **[Loop Closure from Two Views: Revisiting PGO for Scalable Trajectory Estimation through Monocular Priors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16275v2)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>(Visual) Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) remains a fundamental challenge in enabling autonomous systems to navigate and understand large-scale environments. Traditional SLAM approaches struggle to balance efficiency and accuracy, particularly in large-scale settings where extensive computational resources are required for scene reconstruction and Bundle Adjustment (BA). However, this scene reconstruction, in the form of sparse pointclouds of visual landmarks, is often only used within the SLAM system because navigation and planning methods require different map representations. In this work, we therefore investigate a more scalable Visual SLAM (VSLAM) approach without reconstruction, mainly based on approaches for two-view loop closures. By restricting the map to a sparse keyframed pose graph without dense geometry representations, our `2GO' system achieves efficient optimization with competitive absolute trajectory accuracy. In particular, we find that recent advancements in image matching and monocular depth priors enable very accurate trajectory optimization without BA. We conduct extensive experiments on diverse datasets, including large-scale scenarios, and provide a detailed analysis of the trade-offs between runtime, accuracy, and map size. Our results demonstrate that this streamlined approach supports real-time performance, scales well in map size and trajectory duration, and effectively broadens the capabilities of VSLAM for long-duration deployments to large environments.</p></details> |  |

Researchers have investigated various methods to extract motion information from a single blurred image, including blur kernels and optical flow. However, existing motion representations are often of low quality, i.e., coarse-grained and inaccurate. In this paper, we propose the first high-resolution (HR) Motion Trajectory estimation framework using Diffusion models (MoTDiff). Different from existing motion representations, we aim to estimate an HR motion trajectory with high-quality from a single motion-blurred image. The proposed MoTDiff consists of two key components: 1) a new conditional diffusion framework that uses multi-scale feature maps extracted from a single blurred image as a condition, and 2) a new training method that can promote precise identification of a fine-grained motion trajectory, consistent estimation of overall shape and position of a motion path, and pixel connectivity along a motion trajectory. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed MoTDiff can outperform state-of-the-art methods in both blind image deblurring and coded exposure photography applications.</p></details> | 10 pages, 6 figures |

While recent deep learning approaches have shown promise, they often process sequence and structure information independently, failing to capture the intricate coupling between local structural geometry and global sequential patterns. We present DGTN (Diffused Graph-Transformer Network), a novel architecture that co-learns graph neural network (GNN) weights for structural priors and transformer attention through a diffusion mechanism. Our key innovation is a bidirectional diffusion process where: (1) GNN-derived structural embeddings guide transformer attention via learnable diffusion kernels, and (2) transformer representations refine GNN message passing through attention-modulated graph updates. We provide rigorous mathematical analysis showing this co-learning scheme achieves provably better approximation bounds than independent processing. On ProTherm and SKEMPI benchmarks, DGTN achieves state-of-the-art performance (Pearson Rho = 0.87, RMSE = 1.21 kcal/mol), with 6.2% improvement over best baselines. Ablation studies confirm the diffusion mechanism contributes 4.8 points to correlation. Our theoretical analysis proves the diffused attention converges to optimal structure-sequence coupling, with convergence rate O(1/sqrt(T) ) where T is diffusion steps. This work establishes a principled framework for integrating heterogeneous protein representations through learnable diffusion.</p></details> |  |

While existing filtering and strategic deployment techniques optimize collected data volume at the edge, they overlook how variations in sampling frequencies and spatial coverage affect downstream model performance. In many forecasting models, incorporating data from additional sensors denoise predictions by providing broader spatial contexts. This interplay between sampling frequency, spatial coverage and different forecasting model architectures remain underexplored. This work presents a systematic study of forecasting models - classical models (VAR), neural networks (GRU, Transformer), spatio-temporal graph neural networks (STGNNs), and time series foundation models (TSFMs: Chronos Moirai, TimesFM) under varying spatial sensor nodes density and sampling intervals using real-world temperature data in a wireless sensor network. Our results show that STGNNs are effective when sensor deployments are sparse and sampling rate is moderate, leveraging spatial correlations via encoded graph structure to compensate for limited coverage. In contrast, TSFMs perform competitively at high frequencies but degrade when spatial coverage from neighboring sensors is reduced. Crucially, the multivariate TSFM Moirai outperforms all models by natively learning cross-sensor dependencies. These findings offer actionable insights for building efficient forecasting pipelines in spatio-temporal systems. All code for model configurations, training, dataset, and logs are open-sourced for reproducibility: https://github.com/UIUC-MONET-Projects/Benchmarking-Spatiotemporal-Forecast-Models</p></details> |  |

Its development began with early graph-theoretic methods, gaining significant momentum with the advent of graph neural networks (GNNs). Over the past decade, progress in scalable architectures, dynamic graph modeling, multimodal learning, generative AI, explainable AI (XAI), and responsible AI has broadened the applicability of graph learning to various challenging environments. Graph learning is significant due to its ability to model complex, non-Euclidean relationships that traditional machine learning struggles to capture, thus better supporting real-world applications ranging from drug discovery and fraud detection to recommender systems and scientific reasoning. However, challenges like scalability, generalization, heterogeneity, interpretability, and trustworthiness must be addressed to unlock its full potential. This survey provides a comprehensive introduction to graph learning, focusing on key dimensions including scalable, temporal, multimodal, generative, explainable, and responsible graph learning. We review state-of-the-art techniques for efficiently handling large-scale graphs, capturing dynamic temporal dependencies, integrating heterogeneous data modalities, generating novel graph samples, and enhancing interpretability to foster trust and transparency. We also explore ethical considerations, such as privacy and fairness, to ensure responsible deployment of graph learning models. Additionally, we identify and discuss emerging topics, highlighting recent integration of graph learning and other AI paradigms and offering insights into future directions. This survey serves as a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners seeking to navigate the rapidly evolving landscape of graph learning.</p></details> | 185 pages |

Standard Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) commonly optimize for the average error, underperforming on these uncommon but critical cases, with existing oversampling methods often distorting molecular topology. In this paper, we introduce SPECTRA, a Spectral Target-Aware graph augmentation framework that generates realistic molecular graphs in the spectral domain. SPECTRA (i) reconstructs multi-attribute molecular graphs from SMILES; (ii) aligns molecule pairs via (Fused) Gromov-Wasserstein couplings to obtain node correspondences; (iii) interpolates Laplacian eigenvalues, eigenvectors and node features in a stable share-basis; and (iv) reconstructs edges to synthesize physically plausible intermediates with interpolated targets. A rarity-aware budgeting scheme, derived from a kernel density estimation of labels, concentrates augmentation where data are scarce. Coupled with a spectral GNN using edge-aware Chebyshev convolutions, SPECTRA densifies underrepresented regions without degrading global accuracy. On benchmarks, SPECTRA consistently improves error in relevant target ranges while maintaining competitive overall MAE, and yields interpretable synthetic molecules whose structure reflects the underlying spectral geometry. Our results demonstrate that spectral, geometry-aware augmentation is an effective and efficient strategy for imbalanced molecular property regression.</p></details> |  |

However, current forecasting solutions lack the temporal and spatial resolution required by system operators. In this paper, we introduce SolarCrossFormer, a novel deep learning model for day-ahead irradiance forecasting, that combines satellite images and time series from a ground-based network of meteorological stations. SolarCrossFormer uses novel graph neural networks to exploit the inter- and intra-modal correlations of the input data and improve the accuracy and resolution of the forecasts. It generates probabilistic forecasts for any location in Switzerland with a 15-minute resolution for horizons up to 24 hours ahead. One of the key advantages of SolarCrossFormer its robustness in real life operations. It can incorporate new time-series data without retraining the model and, additionally, it can produce forecasts for locations without input data by using only their coordinates. Experimental results over a dataset of one year and 127 locations across Switzerland show that SolarCrossFormer yield a normalized mean absolute error of 6.1 % over the forecasting horizon.

This brittleness stems, in part, from learning statistical associations rather than causal mechanisms. Causal graph neural networks address this triple crisis of distribution shift, discrimination, and inscrutability by combining graph-based representations of biomedical data with causal inference principles to learn invariant mechanisms rather than spurious correlations. This Review examines methodological foundations spanning structural causal models, disentangled causal representation learning, and techniques for interventional prediction and counterfactual reasoning on graphs. We analyse applications demonstrating clinical value across psychiatric diagnosis through brain network analysis, cancer subtyping via multi-omics causal integration, continuous physiological monitoring with mechanistic interpretation, and drug recommendation correcting prescription bias. These advances establish foundations for patient-specific Causal Digital Twins, enabling in silico clinical experimentation, with integration of large language models for hypothesis generation and causal graph neural networks for mechanistic validation. Substantial barriers remain, including computational requirements precluding real-time deployment, validation challenges demanding multi-modal evidence triangulation beyond cross-validation, and risks of causal-washing where methods employ causal terminology without rigorous evidentiary support. We propose tiered frameworks distinguishing causally-inspired architectures from causally-validated discoveries and identify critical research priorities making causal rather than purely associational claims.</p></details> |  |

User behaviors, interface elements, and their potential connections are abstracted into a graph structure, and joint modeling of nodes and edges is used to capture semantics and dependencies in the interaction process. Graph convolution and attention mechanisms are introduced to fuse local features and global context, and global pooling with a classification layer is applied to achieve automated satisfaction classification. The method extracts deep patterns from structured data and improves adaptability and robustness in multi-source heterogeneous and dynamic environments. To verify effectiveness, a public user satisfaction survey dataset from Kaggle is used, and results are compared with multiple baseline models across several performance metrics. Experiments show that the method outperforms existing approaches in accuracy, F1-Score, AUC, and Precision, demonstrating the advantage of graph-based modeling in satisfaction prediction tasks. The study not only enriches the theoretical framework of user modeling but also highlights its practical value in optimizing human-computer interaction experience.</p></details> |  |

As models increase in size and complexity, DNN workloads like training and inference tasks impose unprecedented demands on distributed computing resources, making the accurate prediction of runtime essential for optimizing development and resource allocation. Traditional methods rely on additive computational unit models, limiting their accuracy and generalizability. In contrast, graph-enhanced modeling improves performance but significantly increases data collection costs. Therefore, there is a critical need for a method that strikes a balance between accuracy, generalizability, and the costs of data collection. To address these challenges, we propose ScaleDL, a novel runtime prediction framework that combines nonlinear layer-wise modeling with graph neural network (GNN)-based cross-layer interaction mechanism, enabling accurate DNN runtime prediction and hierarchical generalizability across different network architectures. Additionally, we employ the D-optimal method to reduce data collection costs. Experiments on the workloads of five popular DNN models prove that ScaleDL enhances runtime prediction accuracy and generalizability, achieving 6$\times$ lower MRE and 5$\times$ lower RMSE compared to baseline models.</p></details> |  |
| **[DeNoise: Learning Robust Graph Representations for Unsupervised Graph-Level Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04086v1)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid growth of graph-structured data in critical domains, unsupervised graph-level anomaly detection (UGAD) has become a pivotal task. UGAD seeks to identify entire graphs that deviate from normal behavioral patterns. However, most Graph Neural Network (GNN) approaches implicitly assume that the training set is clean, containing only normal graphs, which is rarely true in practice. Even modest contamination by anomalous graphs can distort learned representations and sharply degrade performance. To address this challenge, we propose DeNoise, a robust UGAD framework explicitly designed for contaminated training data. It jointly optimizes a graph-level encoder, an attribute decoder, and a structure decoder via an adversarial objective to learn noise-resistant embeddings. Further, DeNoise introduces an encoder anchor-alignment denoising mechanism that fuses high-information node embeddings from normal graphs into all graph embeddings, improving representation quality while suppressing anomaly interference. A contrastive learning component then compacts normal graph embeddings and repels anomalous ones in the latent space. Extensive experiments on eight real-world datasets demonstrate that DeNoise consistently learns reliable graph-level representations under varying noise intensities and significantly outperforms state-of-the-art UGAD baselines.</p></details> |  |

While previous studies have employed pre-trained TKG embeddings or graph neural networks to inject temporal knowledge, they fail to fully understand the complex semantic information of time constraints. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable progress, benefiting from their strong semantic understanding and reasoning generalization capabilities. However, their temporal reasoning ability remains limited. LLMs frequently suffer from hallucination and a lack of knowledge. To address these limitations, we propose the Plan of Knowledge framework with a contrastive temporal retriever, which is named PoK. Specifically, the proposed Plan of Knowledge module decomposes a complex temporal question into a sequence of sub-objectives from the pre-defined tools, serving as intermediate guidance for reasoning exploration. In parallel, we construct a Temporal Knowledge Store (TKS) with a contrastive retrieval framework, enabling the model to selectively retrieve semantically and temporally aligned facts from TKGs. By combining structured planning with temporal knowledge retrieval, PoK effectively enhances the interpretability and factual consistency of temporal reasoning. Extensive experiments on four benchmark TKGQA datasets demonstrate that PoK significantly improves the retrieval precision and reasoning accuracy of LLMs, surpassing the performance of the state-of-the-art TKGQA methods by 56.0% at most.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |

Efficiently adapting pretrained ViTs for DG is challenging; standard fine-tuning is costly and can impair generalization. We propose GNN-MoE, enhancing Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) for DG with a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework using efficient Kronecker adapters. Instead of token-based routing, a novel Graph Neural Network (GNN) router (GCN, GAT, SAGE) operates on inter-patch graphs to dynamically assign patches to specialized experts. This context-aware GNN routing leverages inter-patch relationships for better adaptation to domain shifts. GNN-MoE achieves state-of-the-art or competitive DG benchmark performance with high parameter efficiency, highlighting the utility of graph-based contextual routing for robust, lightweight DG.</p></details> | 6 pages, 3 figures |

In this paper, we propose localized versions of the Weisfeiler-Leman (WL) algorithms to improve both expressivity and computational efficiency for this task. We introduce Local $k$-WL, which we prove to be more expressive than $k$-WL and at most as expressive as $(k+1)$-WL, and provide a characterization of patterns whose subgraph and induced subgraph counts are invariant under Local $k$-WL equivalence. To enhance scalability, we present two variants -- Layer $k$-WL and Recursive $k$-WL -- that achieve greater time and space efficiency compared to applying $k$-WL on the entire graph. Additionally, we propose a novel fragmentation technique that decomposes complex subgraphs into simpler subpatterns, enabling the exact count of all induced subgraphs of size at most $4$ using only $1$-WL, with extensions possible for larger patterns when $k>1$. Building on these ideas, we develop a three-stage differentiable learning framework that combines subpattern counts to compute counts of more complex motifs, bridging combinatorial algorithm design with machine learning approaches. We also compare the expressive power of Local $k$-WL with existing GNN hierarchies and demonstrate that, under bounded time complexity, our methods are more expressive than prior approaches.</p></details> |  |

While this local message passing paradigm imparts a powerful inductive bias and exploits graph sparsity, it also yields three key challenges: (i) oversquashing of long-range information, (ii) oversmoothing of node representations, and (iii) limited expressive power. In this work we inject randomized global embeddings of node features, which we term \textit{Sketched Random Features}, into standard GNNs, enabling them to efficiently capture long-range dependencies. The embeddings are unique, distance-sensitive, and topology-agnostic -- properties which we analytically and empirically show alleviate the aforementioned limitations when injected into GNNs. Experimental results on real-world graph learning tasks confirm that this strategy consistently improves performance over baseline GNNs, offering both a standalone solution and a complementary enhancement to existing techniques such as graph positional encodings.

We propose a novel graph-based deep learning framework DGL to analyze and forecast industrial CO_2 emissions, addressing high feature correlation and capturing industrial-temporal interdependencies. Unlike traditional regression or clustering methods, our approach leverages a Graph Neural Network (GNN) with attention mechanisms to model relationships between industries (or regions) and a temporal transformer to learn long-range patterns. We evaluate our framework on public global industry emissions dataset derived from EDGAR v8.0, spanning multiple countries and sectors. The proposed model achieves superior predictive performance - reducing error by over 15% compared to baseline deep models - while maintaining interpretability via attention weights and causal analysis. We believe that we are the first Graph-Temporal architecture that resolves multicollinearity by structurally encoding feature relationships, along with integration of causal inference to identify true drivers of emissions, improving transparency and fairness. We also stand a demonstration of policy relevance, showing how model insights can guide sector-specific decarbonization strategies aligned with sustainable development goals. Based on the above, we show high-emission "hotspots" and suggest equitable intervention plans, illustrating the potential of state-of-the-art AI graph learning to advance climate action, offering a powerful tool for policymakers and industry stakeholders to achieve carbon reduction targets.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025 AI for Science Workshop</p></details> |

GNN transferability allows training on smaller graphs and applying the model to larger ones, but existing methods often rely on random subsampling, leading to disconnected subgraphs and reduced model expressivity. We propose a novel graph sampling algorithm that leverages feature homophily to preserve graph structure. By minimizing the trace of the data correlation matrix, our method better preserves the graph Laplacian trace -- a proxy for the graph connectivity -- than random sampling, while achieving lower complexity than spectral methods. Experiments on citation networks show improved performance in preserving Laplacian trace and GNN transferability compared to random sampling.</p></details> |  |

This study proposes a machine learning-driven framework for (1) detecting malicious cyberattacks and (2) identifying faulty device anomalies, leveraging a dataset of 200,000 records. Eight machine learning models are evaluated across three learning approaches: supervised learning (XGBoost, K-Nearest Neighbors (K- NN)), semi-supervised learning (Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN), Variational Autoencoders (VAE)), and unsupervised learning (One-Class Support Vector Machine (SVM), Isolation Forest, Graph Neural Networks (GNN), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Autoencoders). The comprehensive evaluation was conducted across multiple metrics like F1-score, precision, recall, accuracy, ROC-AUC, computational efficiency. XGBoost achieved 99\% accuracy with minimal computational overhead (0.04s) for anomaly detection, while Isolation Forest balanced precision and recall effectively. LSTM Autoencoders underperformed with lower accuracy and higher latency. For attack detection, KNN achieved near-perfect precision, recall, and F1-score with the lowest computational cost (0.05s), followed by VAE at 97% accuracy. GAN showed the highest computational cost with lowest accuracy and ROC-AUC. These findings enhance IoT-enabled healthcare security through effective anomaly detection strategies. By improving early detection of cyber threats and device failures, this framework has the potential to prevent data breaches, minimize system downtime, and ensure the continuous and safe operation of medical devices, ultimately safeguarding patient health and trust in IoT-driven healthcare solutions.</p></details> |  |

Significant strides have been made in leveraging Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to achieve remarkable success in these areas. However, in real-world scenarios, the training environment for models is often far from ideal, leading to substantial performance degradation of GNN models due to various unfavorable factors, including imbalance in data distribution, the presence of noise in erroneous data, privacy protection of sensitive information, and generalization capability for out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. To tackle these issues, substantial efforts have been devoted to improving the performance of GNN models in practical real-world scenarios, as well as enhancing their reliability and robustness. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey that systematically reviews existing GNN models, focusing on solutions to the four mentioned real-world challenges including imbalance, noise, privacy, and OOD in practical scenarios that many existing reviews have not considered. Specifically, we first highlight the four key challenges faced by existing GNNs, paving the way for our exploration of real-world GNN models. Subsequently, we provide detailed discussions on these four aspects, dissecting how these solutions contribute to enhancing the reliability and robustness of GNN models. Last but not least, we outline promising directions and offer future perspectives in the field.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence (TPAMI 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Learning noisy tissue dynamics across time scales](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19090v2)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tissue dynamics play a crucial role in biological processes ranging from inflammation to morphogenesis. However, these noisy multicellular dynamics are notoriously hard to predict. Here, we introduce a biomimetic machine learning framework capable of inferring noisy multicellular dynamics directly from experimental movies. This generative model combines graph neural networks, normalizing flows and WaveNet algorithms to represent tissues as neural stochastic differential equations where cells are edges of an evolving graph. Cell interactions are encoded in a dual signaling graph capable of handling signaling cascades. The dual graph architecture of our neural networks reflects the architecture of the underlying biological tissues, substantially reducing the amount of data needed for training, compared to convolutional or fully-connected neural networks. Taking epithelial tissue experiments as a case study, we show that our model not only captures stochastic cell motion but also predicts the evolution of cell states in their division cycle. Finally, we demonstrate that our method can accurately generate the experimental dynamics of developmental systems, such as the fly wing, and cell signaling processes mediated by stochastic ERK waves, paving the way for its use as a digital twin in bioengineering and clinical contexts.</p></details> | 15 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Graph Neural AI with Temporal Dynamics for Comprehensive Anomaly Detection in Microservices](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03285v1)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study addresses the problem of anomaly detection and root cause tracing in microservice architectures and proposes a unified framework that combines graph neural networks with temporal modeling. The microservice call chain is abstracted as a directed graph, where multidimensional features of nodes and edges are used to construct a service topology representation, and graph convolution is applied to aggregate features across nodes and model dependencies, capturing complex structural relationships among services. On this basis, gated recurrent units are introduced to model the temporal evolution of call chains, and multi-layer stacking and concatenation operations are used to jointly obtain structural and temporal representations, improving the ability to identify anomaly patterns. Furthermore, anomaly scoring functions at both the node and path levels are defined to achieve unified modeling from local anomaly detection to global call chain tracing, which enables the identification of abnormal service nodes and the reconstruction of potential anomaly propagation paths. Sensitivity experiments are then designed from multiple dimensions, including hyperparameters, environmental disturbances, and data distribution, to evaluate the framework, and results show that it outperforms baseline methods in key metrics such as AUC, ACC, Recall, and F1-Score, maintaining high accuracy and stability under dynamic topologies and complex environments. This research not only provides a new technical path for anomaly detection in microservices but also lays a methodological foundation for intelligent operations in distributed systems.</p></details> |  |

Existing approaches often struggle with negative transfer, scalability issues, and high adaptation costs. To address these challenges, we propose GMoPE (Graph Mixture of Prompt-Experts), a novel framework that seamlessly integrates the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture with prompt-based learning for graphs. GMoPE leverages expert-specific prompt vectors and structure-aware MoE routing to enable each expert to specialize in distinct subdomains and dynamically contribute to predictions. To promote diversity and prevent expert collapse, we introduce a soft orthogonality constraint across prompt vectors, encouraging expert specialization and facilitating a more balanced expert utilization. Additionally, we adopt a prompt-only fine-tuning strategy that significantly reduces spatiotemporal complexity during transfer. We validate GMoPE through extensive experiments under various pretraining strategies and multiple downstream tasks. Results show that GMoPE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and achieves performance comparable to full parameter fine-tuning-while requiring only a fraction of the adaptation overhead. Our work provides a principled and scalable framework for advancing generalizable and efficient graph foundation models.</p></details> |  |
| **[GraphCliff: Short-Long Range Gating for Subtle Differences but Critical Changes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03170v1)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantitative structure-activity relationship assumes a smooth relationship between molecular structure and biological activity. However, activity cliffs defined as pairs of structurally similar compounds with large potency differences break this continuity. Recent benchmarks targeting activity cliffs have revealed that classical machine learning models with extended connectivity fingerprints outperform graph neural networks. Our analysis shows that graph embeddings fail to adequately separate structurally similar molecules in the embedding space, making it difficult to distinguish between structurally similar but functionally different molecules. Despite this limitation, molecular graph structures are inherently expressive and attractive, as they preserve molecular topology. To preserve the structural representation of molecules as graphs, we propose a new model, GraphCliff, which integrates short- and long-range information through a gating mechanism. Experimental results demonstrate that GraphCliff consistently improves performance on both non-cliff and cliff compounds. Furthermore, layer-wise node embedding analyses reveal reduced over-smoothing and enhanced discriminative power relative to strong baseline graph models.</p></details> |  |

In this work we stray away from this tradition and provide a principled way to measure similarity between vertex attributed graphs. We denote this measure as the \emph{graph homomorphism distortion}. We show it can \emph{completely characterize} graphs and thus is also a \emph{complete graph embedding}. However, somewhere along the road, we run into the graph canonization problem. To circumvent this obstacle, we devise to efficiently compute this measure via sampling, which in expectation ensures \emph{completeness}. Additionally, we also discovered that we can obtain a metric from this measure. We validate our claims empirically and find that the \emph{graph homomorphism distortion}: (1.) fully distinguishes the \texttt{BREC} dataset with up to $4$-WL non-distinguishable graphs, and (2.) \emph{outperforms} previous methods inspired in homomorphisms under the \texttt{ZINC-12k} dataset. These theoretical results, (and their empirical validation), pave the way for future characterization of graphs, extending the graph theoretic tradition to new frontiers.</p></details> |  |

Traditional Pavement Management Systems (PMS) remain largely reactive, lacking real-time intelligence for failure prevention and optimal maintenance planning. To address this, we propose a unified Digital Twin (DT) and Graph Neural Network (GNN) framework for scalable, data-driven pavement health monitoring and predictive maintenance. Pavement segments and spatial relations are modeled as graph nodes and edges, while real-time UAV, sensor, and LiDAR data stream into the DT. The inductive GNN learns deterioration patterns from graph-structured inputs to forecast distress and enable proactive interventions. Trained on a real-world-inspired dataset with segment attributes and dynamic connectivity, our model achieves an R2 of 0.3798, outperforming baseline regressors and effectively capturing non-linear degradation. We also develop an interactive dashboard and reinforcement learning module for simulation, visualization, and adaptive maintenance planning. This DT-GNN integration enhances forecasting precision and establishes a closed feedback loop for continuous improvement, positioning the approach as a foundation for proactive, intelligent, and sustainable pavement management, with future extensions toward real-world deployment, multi-agent coordination, and smart-city integration.</p></details> |  |
| **[Object Detection as an Optional Basis: A Graph Matching Network for Cross-View UAV Localization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02489v1)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid growth of the low-altitude economy, UAVs have become crucial for measurement and tracking in patrol systems. However, in GNSS-denied areas, satellite-based localization methods are prone to failure. This paper presents a cross-view UAV localization framework that performs map matching via object detection, aimed at effectively addressing cross-temporal, cross-view, heterogeneous aerial image matching. In typical pipelines, UAV visual localization is formulated as an image-retrieval problem: features are extracted to build a localization map, and the pose of a query image is estimated by matching it to a reference database with known poses. Because publicly available UAV localization datasets are limited, many approaches recast localization as a classification task and rely on scene labels in these datasets to ensure accuracy. Other methods seek to reduce cross-domain differences using polar-coordinate reprojection, perspective transformations, or generative adversarial networks; however, they can suffer from misalignment, content loss, and limited realism. In contrast, we leverage modern object detection to accurately extract salient instances from UAV and satellite images, and integrate a graph neural network to reason about inter-image and intra-image node relationships. Using a fine-grained, graph-based node-similarity metric, our method achieves strong retrieval and localization performance. Extensive experiments on public and real-world datasets show that our approach handles heterogeneous appearance differences effectively and generalizes well, making it applicable to scenarios with larger modality gaps, such as infrared-visible image matching. Our dataset will be publicly available at the following URL: https://github.com/liutao23/ODGNNLoc.git.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, Submitted to IEEE TIM</p></details> |

This paper presents HybridST, a hybrid architecture that integrates Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), multi-head temporal Transformers, and supervised ensemble learning methods (XGBoost or Random Forest) to collectively capture spatial dependencies, long-range temporal patterns, and exogenous signals, including weather, calendar, or control states. We test our model on the METR-LA, PEMS-BAY, and Seattle Loop tree public benchmark datasets. These datasets include situations ranging from freeway sensor networks to vehicle-infrastructure cooperative perception. Experimental results show that HybridST consistently beats classical baselines (LSTM, GCN, DCRNN, PDFormer) on important metrics like MAE and RMSE, while still being very scalable and easy to understand. The proposed framework presents a promising avenue for real-time urban mobility planning, energy optimization, and congestion alleviation strategies, especially within the framework of smart cities and significant events such as the 2030 FIFA World Cup.</p></details> |  |

MPNNs have been successfully applied to various node-, edge-, and graph-level tasks in areas like molecular science, computer vision, natural language processing, and combinatorial optimization. However, most MPNNs require training on large amounts of labeled data, which can be costly and time-consuming. In this work, we explore the use of various untrained message passing layers in graph neural networks, i.e. variants of popular message passing architecture where we remove all trainable parameters that are used to transform node features in the message passing step. Focusing on link prediction, we find that untrained message passing layers can lead to competitive and even superior performance compared to fully trained MPNNs, especially in the presence of high-dimensional features. We provide a theoretical analysis of untrained message passing by relating the inner products of features implicitly produced by untrained message passing layers to path-based topological node similarity measures. As such, untrained message passing architectures can be viewed as a highly efficient and interpretable approach to link prediction.</p></details> |  |

However, existing GNNs exhibit poor generalization ability under distribution shifts, which is inevitable in dynamic scenarios. As dynamic graph generation progresses amid evolving latent non-stationary environments, it is imperative to explore their effects on out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization. This paper proposes a novel Evolving Graph Learning framework for OOD generalization (EvoOOD) by environment-aware invariant pattern recognition. Specifically, we first design an environment sequential variational auto-encoder to model environment evolution and infer the underlying environment distribution. Then, we introduce a mechanism for environment-aware invariant pattern recognition, tailored to address environmental diversification through inferred distributions. Finally, we conduct fine-grained causal interventions on individual nodes using a mixture of instantiated environment samples. This approach helps to distinguish spatio-temporal invariant patterns for OOD prediction, especially in non-stationary environments. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of EvoGOOD on both real-world and synthetic dynamic datasets under distribution shifts. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first attempt to study the dynamic graph OOD generalization problem from the environment evolution perspective.</p></details> |  |

Although we use GNNs in wide application scenarios, it is a laborious task to design/select optimal GNN architectures in diverse graphs. To reduce human efforts, graph neural architecture search (Graph NAS) has been used to search for a sub-optimal GNN architecture that combines existing components. However, existing Graph NAS methods lack explainability to understand the reasons why the model architecture is selected because they use complex search space and neural models to select architecture. Therefore, we propose an explainable Graph NAS method, called ExGNAS, which consists of (i) a simple search space that can adapt to various graphs and (ii) a search algorithm with Monte-Carlo tree that makes the decision process explainable. The combination of our search space and algorithm achieves finding accurate GNN models and the important functions within the search space. We comprehensively evaluate ExGNAS compared with four state-of-the-art Graph NAS methods in twelve graphs. Our experimental results show that ExGNAS achieves high average accuracy and efficiency; improving accuracy up to 26.1% and reducing run time up to 88%. Furthermore, we show the effectiveness of explainability by questionnaire-based user study and architecture analysis.</p></details> |  |

Traditional federated recommendation approaches treat each user as an isolated entity, failing to construct global user relationship graphs that capture collaborative signals, which limits the accuracy of recommendations. To address this limitation, we derive insight from the insight that semantic similarity reflects preference. similarity, which can be used to improve the construction of user relationship graphs. This paper proposes UFGraphFR, a novel framework with three key components: 1) On the client side, private structured data is first transformed into text descriptions. These descriptions are then encoded into semantic vectors using pre-trained models; 2) On the server side, user relationship graphs are securely reconstructed using aggregated model weights without accessing raw data, followed by information propagation through lightweight graph neural networks; 3) On the client side, user behavior sequences are personalized using Transformer architectures. Extensive experiments conducted on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that UFGraphFR significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both recommendation accuracy and personalization. The framework also maintains robustness across different pre-trained models, as evidenced by the consistent performance metrics obtained. This work provides a practical method for efficient federated recommendations with strict privacy by using semantic vectors, secure user relationship graphs, and personalized behavior sequences.

Automated detection of MDD using structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) and deep learning (DL) methods holds increasing promise for improving diagnostic accuracy and enabling early intervention. Most existing methods employ either voxel-level features or handcrafted regional representations built from predefined brain atlases, limiting their ability to capture complex brain patterns. This paper develops a unified pipeline that utilizes Vision Transformers (ViTs) for extracting 3D region embeddings from sMRI data and Graph Neural Network (GNN) for classification. We explore two strategies for defining regions: (1) an atlas-based approach using predefined structural and functional brain atlases, and (2) an cube-based method by which ViTs are trained directly to identify regions from uniformly extracted 3D patches. Further, cosine similarity graphs are generated to model interregional relationships, and guide GNN-based classification. Extensive experiments were conducted using the REST-meta-MDD dataset to demonstrate the effectiveness of our model. With stratified 10-fold cross-validation, the best model obtained 81.51\% accuracy, 85.94\% sensitivity, 76.36\% specificity, 80.88\% precision, and 83.33\% F1-score. Further, atlas-based models consistently outperformed the cube-based approach, highlighting the importance of using domain-specific anatomical priors for MDD detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 3 figure, 9 tables</p></details> |

Deploying such services in privacy-critical cloud environments necessitates the development of secure inference (SI) protocols that safeguard sensitive GS data. However, existing SI solutions largely focus on convolutional models for image and text data, leaving the challenge of securing GNNs and GS data relatively underexplored. In this work, we design, implement, and evaluate $\sysname$, a lightweight cryptographic scheme for graph-centric inference in the cloud. By hybridizing additive and function secret sharings within secure two-party computation (2PC), $\sysname$ is carefully designed based on a series of novel 2PC interactive protocols that achieve $1.5\times \sim 1.7\times$ speedups for linear layers and $2\times \sim 15\times$ for non-linear layers over state-of-the-art (SotA) solutions. A thorough theoretical analysis is provided to prove $\sysname$'s correctness, security, and lightweight nature. Extensive experiments across four datasets demonstrate $\sysname$'s superior efficiency with $1.3\times \sim 4.7\times$ faster secure predictions while maintaining accuracy comparable to plaintext graph property inference.</p></details> | Accepted to FC'25 |

The critical seed chaining step must connect exact k-mer matches between reads and reference genomes while filtering spurious matches, yet state-of-the-art methods rely on fixed gap penalty functions unable to adapt to varying genomic contexts including tandem repeats and structural variants. This paper presents RawHash3, a hybrid framework combining graph neural networks with classical dynamic programming for adaptive seed chaining that maintains real-time performance while providing statistical guarantees. We formalize seed chaining as graph learning where seeds constitute nodes with 12-dimensional feature vectors and edges encode 8-dimensional spatial relationships including gap consistency. Our architecture employs three-layer EdgeConv GNN with confidence-based method selection that dynamically switches between learned guidance and algorithmic fallback. Comprehensive evaluation on 1,000 synthetic nanopore reads with 5,200 test seeds demonstrates RawHash3 achieves 99.94 percent precision and 40.07 percent recall, representing statistically significant 25.0 percent relative improvement over baseline with p less than 0.001. The system maintains median inference latency of 1.59ms meeting real-time constraints, while demonstrating superior robustness with 100 percent success rate under 20 percent label corruption versus baseline degradation to 30.3 percent. Cross-validation confirms stability establishing graph neural networks as viable approach for production genomics pipelines.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages, 12 figures, 6 tables.

However, are LLMs strictly necessary, or can smaller, domain-grounded models suffice? We identify a large class of simulation problems in which individuals make choices among discrete options, where a graph neural network (GNN) can match or surpass strong LLM baselines despite being three orders of magnitude smaller. We introduce Graph-basEd Models for human Simulation (GEMS), which casts discrete choice simulation tasks as a link prediction problem on graphs, leveraging relational knowledge while incorporating language representations only when needed. Evaluations across three key settings on three simulation datasets show that GEMS achieves comparable or better accuracy than LLMs, with far greater efficiency, interpretability, and transparency, highlighting the promise of graph-based modeling as a lightweight alternative to LLMs for human simulation.

The objective of this systematic literature review is hence to provide a comprehensive overview of the various modeling approaches and application domains of GNNs for time series classification and forecasting. A database search was conducted, and 366 papers were selected for a detailed examination of the current state-of-the-art in the field. This examination is intended to offer to the reader a comprehensive review of proposed models, links to related source code, available datasets, benchmark models, and fitting results. All this information is hoped to assist researchers in their studies. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first and broadest systematic literature review presenting a detailed comparison of results from current spatio-temporal GNN models applied to different domains. In its final part, this review discusses current limitations and challenges in the application of spatio-temporal GNNs, such as comparability, reproducibility, explainability, poor information capacity, and scalability. This paper is complemented by a GitHub repository at https://github.com/FlaGer99/SLR-Spatio-Temporal-GNN.git providing additional interactive tools to further explore the presented findings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Predicting Microbial Interactions Using Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02038v1)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predicting interspecies interactions is a key challenge in microbial ecology, as these interactions are critical to determining the structure and activity of microbial communities. In this work, we used data on monoculture growth capabilities, interactions with other species, and phylogeny to predict a negative or positive effect of interactions. More precisely, we used one of the largest available pairwise interaction datasets to train our models, comprising over 7,500 interactions be- tween 20 species from two taxonomic groups co-cultured under 40 distinct carbon conditions, with a primary focus on the work of Nestor et al.[28 ]. In this work, we propose Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) as a powerful classifier to predict the direction of the effect. We construct edge-graphs of pairwise microbial interactions in order to leverage shared information across individual co-culture experiments, and use GNNs to predict modes of interaction. Our model can not only predict binary interactions (positive/negative) but also classify more complex interaction types such as mutualism, competition, and parasitism. Our initial results were encouraging, achieving an F1-score of 80.44%. This significantly outperforms comparable methods in the literature, including conventional Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) models, which reported an F1-score of 72.76%.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 3 figures, NeurIPS 2025 Workshop New Perspectives in Graph Machine Learning</p></details> |
| **[E2Former: An Efficient and Equivariant Transformer with Linear-Scaling Tensor Products](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19216v4)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Equivariant Graph Neural Networks (EGNNs) have demonstrated significant success in modeling microscale systems, including those in chemistry, biology and materials science. However, EGNNs face substantial computational challenges due to the high cost of constructing edge features via spherical tensor products, making them impractical for large-scale systems. To address this limitation, we introduce E2Former, an equivariant and efficient transformer architecture that incorporates the Wigner $6j$ convolution (Wigner $6j$ Conv). By shifting the computational burden from edges to nodes, the Wigner $6j$ Conv reduces the complexity from $O(|\mathcal{E}|)$ to $ O(| \mathcal{V}|)$ while preserving both the model's expressive power and rotational equivariance. We show that this approach achieves a 7x-30x speedup compared to conventional $\mathrm{SO}(3)$ convolutions. Furthermore, our empirical results demonstrate that the derived E2Former mitigates the computational challenges of existing approaches without compromising the ability to capture detailed geometric information. This development could suggest a promising direction for scalable and efficient molecular modeling.</p></details> |  |
| **[RELATE: A Schema-Agnostic Perceiver Encoder for Multimodal Relational Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19954v3)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Relational multi-table data is common in domains such as e-commerce, healthcare, and scientific research, and can be naturally represented as heterogeneous temporal graphs with multi-modal node attributes. Existing graph neural networks (GNNs) rely on schema-specific feature encoders, requiring separate modules for each node type and feature column, which hinders scalability and parameter sharing. We introduce RELATE (Relational Encoder for Latent Aggregation of Typed Entities), a schema-agnostic, plug-and-play feature encoder that can be used with any general purpose GNN. RELATE employs shared modality-specific encoders for categorical, numerical, textual, and temporal attributes, followed by a Perceiver-style cross-attention module that aggregates features into a fixed-size, permutation-invariant node representation. We evaluate RELATE on ReLGNN and HGT in the RelBench benchmark, where it achieves performance within 3% of schema-specific encoders while reducing parameter counts by up to 5x. This design supports varying schemas and enables multi-dataset pretraining for general-purpose GNNs, paving the way toward foundation models for relational graph data.</p></details> | 6 pages |

A crucial goal is to extract insights from this data that shed light on the nature and composition of the Universe. In this paper we introduce CosmoBench, a benchmark dataset curated from state-of-the-art cosmological simulations whose runs required more than 41 million core-hours and generated over two petabytes of data. CosmoBench is the largest dataset of its kind: it contains 34 thousand point clouds from simulations of dark matter halos and galaxies at three different length scales, as well as 25 thousand directed trees that record the formation history of halos on two different time scales. The data in CosmoBench can be used for multiple tasks -- to predict cosmological parameters from point clouds and merger trees, to predict the velocities of individual halos and galaxies from their collective positions, and to reconstruct merger trees on finer time scales from those on coarser time scales. We provide several baselines on these tasks, some based on established approaches from cosmological modeling and others rooted in machine learning. For the latter, we study different approaches -- from simple linear models that are minimally constrained by symmetries to much larger and more computationally-demanding models in deep learning, such as graph neural networks. We find that least-squares fits with a handful of invariant features sometimes outperform deep architectures with many more parameters and far longer training time. Still there remains tremendous potential to improve these baselines by combining machine learning and cosmology to fully exploit the data. CosmoBench sets the stage for bridging cosmology and geometric deep learning at scale. We invite the community to push the frontier of scientific discovery by engaging with this dataset, available at https://cosmobench.streamlit.app</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

Quantum Low-Density Parity-Check (QLDPC) codes have emerged as a promising solution for scalable Quantum Error Correction (QEC) applications by supporting constant-rate encoding and a sparse parity-check structure. However, decoding QLDPC codes via traditional approaches such as Belief Propagation (BP) suffers from poor convergence in the presence of short cycles. Machine learning techniques like Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) utilize learned message passing over their node features; however, they are restricted to pairwise interactions on Tanner graphs, which limits their ability to capture higher-order correlations. In this work, we propose HyperNQ, the first Hypergraph Neural Network (HGNN)- based QLDPC decoder that captures higher-order stabilizer constraints by utilizing hyperedges-thus enabling highly expressive and compact decoding. We use a two-stage message passing scheme and evaluate the decoder over the pseudo-threshold region. Below the pseudo-threshold mark, HyperNQ improves the Logical Error Rate (LER) up to 84% over BP and 50% over GNN-based strategies, demonstrating enhanced performance over the existing state-of-the-art decoders.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 4 figures, Submitted to the IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC 2026).

| **[GraphTeam: Facilitating Large Language Model-based Graph Analysis via Multi-Agent Collaboration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18032v5)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graphs are widely used for modeling relational data in real-world scenarios, such as social networks and urban computing. Existing LLM-based graph analysis approaches either integrate graph neural networks (GNNs) for specific machine learning tasks, limiting their transferability, or rely solely on LLMs' internal reasoning ability, resulting in suboptimal performance. To address these limitations, we take advantage of recent advances in LLM-based agents, which have shown capabilities of utilizing external knowledge or tools for problem solving. By simulating human problem-solving strategies such as analogy and collaboration, we propose a multi-agent system based on LLMs named GraphTeam, for graph analysis. GraphTeam consists of five LLM-based agents from three modules, and the agents with different specialities can collaborate with each other to address complex problems. Specifically, (1) input-output normalization module: the question agent extracts and refines four key arguments from the original question, facilitating the problem understanding, and the answer agent organizes the results to meet the output requirement; (2) external knowledge retrieval module: we first build a knowledge base consisting of relevant documentation and experience information, and then the search agent retrieves the most relevant entries for each question. (3) problem-solving module: given the retrieved information from search agent, the coding agent uses established algorithms via programming to generate solutions, and in case the coding agent does not work, the reasoning agent will directly compute the results without programming. Extensive experiments on six graph analysis benchmarks demonstrate that GraphTeam achieves state-of-the-art performance with an average 25.85% improvement over the best baseline in terms of accuracy.

As more and more users move towards cloud computing, it has become a critical issue to unleash the power of GNNs while protecting the privacy in cloud environments. Specifically, the training data and inference data for GNNs need to be protected from being stolen by external adversaries. Meanwhile, the financial cost of cloud computing is another primary concern for users. Therefore, although existing studies have proposed privacy-preserving techniques for GNNs in cloud environments, their additional computational and communication overhead remain relatively high, causing high financial costs that limit their widespread adoption among users. To protect GNN privacy while lowering the additional financial costs, we introduce Panther, a cost-effective privacy-preserving framework for GNN training and inference services in cloud environments. Technically, Panther leverages four-party computation to asynchronously executing the secure array access protocol, and randomly pads the neighbor information of GNN nodes. We prove that Panther can protect privacy for both training and inference of GNN models. Our evaluation shows that Panther reduces the training and inference time by an average of 75.28% and 82.80%, respectively, and communication overhead by an average of 52.61% and 50.26% compared with the state-of-the-art, which is estimated to save an average of 55.05% and 59.00% in financial costs (based on on-demand pricing model) for the GNN training and inference process on Google Cloud Platform.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in IEEE Transactions on Services Computing (TSC)</p></details> |

However, its network structure evolves dynamically under the influence of geopolitical, economic, and environmental factors, making it challenging to model and predict future trade links. Effectively capturing temporal patterns in food trade networks is therefore essential for improving the accuracy and robustness of link prediction. This study introduces IVGAE-TAMA-BO, a novel dynamic graph neural network designed to model evolving trade structures and predict future links in global food trade networks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to apply dynamic graph neural networks to this domain, significantly enhancing predictive performance. Building upon the original IVGAE framework, the proposed model incorporates a Trade-Aware Momentum Aggregator (TAMA) to capture the temporal evolution of trade networks, jointly modeling short-term fluctuations and long-term structural dependencies. A momentum-based structural memory mechanism further improves predictive stability and performance. In addition, Bayesian optimization is used to automatically tune key hyperparameters, enhancing generalization across diverse trade scenarios. Extensive experiments on five crop-specific datasets demonstrate that IVGAE-TAMA substantially outperforms the static IVGAE and other dynamic baselines by effectively modeling temporal dependencies, while Bayesian optimization further boosts performance in IVGAE-TAMA-BO. These results highlight the proposed framework as a robust and scalable solution for structural prediction in global trade networks, with strong potential for applications in food security monitoring and policy decision support.</p></details> | 26pages,6figures |
| **[DuSEGO: Dual Second-order Equivariant Graph Ordinary Differential Equation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10000v3)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with equivariant properties have achieved significant success in modeling complex dynamic systems and molecular properties. However, their expressiveness ability is limited by: (1) Existing methods often overlook the over-smoothing issue caused by traditional GNN models, as well as the gradient explosion or vanishing problems in deep GNNs. (2) Most models operate on first-order information, neglecting that the real world often consists of second-order systems, which further limits the model's representation capabilities. To address these issues, we propose the \textbf{Du}al \textbf{S}econd-order \textbf{E}quivariant \textbf{G}raph \textbf{O}rdinary Differential Equation (\method{}) for equivariant representation. Specifically, \method{} apply the dual second-order equivariant graph ordinary differential equations (Graph ODEs) on graph embeddings and node coordinates, simultaneously. Theoretically, we first prove that \method{} maintains the equivariant property. Furthermore, we provide theoretical insights showing that \method{} effectively alleviates the over-smoothing problem in both feature representation and coordinate update. Additionally, we demonstrate that the proposed \method{} mitigates the exploding and vanishing gradients problem, facilitating the training of deep multi-layer GNNs. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets validate the superiority of the proposed \method{} compared to baselines.</p></details> |  |

Although multi-scale Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) hold potential for modeling these relationships, they frequently neglect two key points: the subtle intra-attribute patterns within each stock affecting inter-stock correlation, and the biased attention to coarse- and fine-grained features during multi-scale sampling. To overcome these challenges, we introduce MS-HGFN (Multi-Scale Hierarchical Graph Fusion Network). The model features a hierarchical GNN module that forms dynamic graphs by learning patterns from intra-attributes and features from inter-attributes over different time scales, thus comprehensively capturing spatio-temporal dependencies. Additionally, a top-down gating approach facilitates the integration of multi-scale spatio-temporal features, preserving critical coarse- and fine-grained features without too much interference. Experiments utilizing real-world datasets from U.S. and Chinese stock markets demonstrate that MS-HGFN outperforms both traditional and advanced models, yielding up to a 1.4% improvement in prediction accuracy and enhanced stability in return simulations. The code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/MS-HGFN.</p></details> |  |

Increased particle multiplicities are straining latency and storage requirements at the data acquisition stage, while new complications are emerging, including higher background levels and more frequent particle vertex misassociations. This in turn necessitates the development of more holistic and scalable reconstruction methods that take advantage of recent advances in machine learning. We propose a novel Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network (HGNN) architecture featuring unique representations for diverse particle collision relationships and integrated graph pruning layers for scalability. Trained with a multi-task paradigm in an environment mimicking the LHCb experiment, this HGNN significantly improves beauty hadron reconstruction performance. Notably, it concurrently performs particle vertex association and graph pruning within a single framework. We quantify reconstruction and pruning performance, demonstrate enhanced inference time scaling with event complexity, and mitigate potential performance loss using a weighted message passing scheme.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 9 figures, 4 tables (revised for Machine Learning Science and Technology)</p></details> |

Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have recently emerged as a powerful paradigm to model spatial dependencies in load data while accommodating complex non-stationarities. This paper introduces a comprehensive framework that integrates graph-based forecasting with attention mechanisms and ensemble aggregation strategies to enhance both predictive accuracy and interpretability. Several GNN architectures -- including Graph Convolutional Networks, GraphSAGE, APPNP, and Graph Attention Networks -- are systematically evaluated on synthetic, regional (France), and fine-grained (UK) datasets. Empirical results demonstrate that graph-aware models consistently outperform conventional baselines such as Feed Forward Neural Networks and foundation models like TiREX. Furthermore, attention layers provide valuable insights into evolving spatial interactions driven by meteorological and seasonal dynamics. Ensemble aggregation, particularly through bottom-up expert combination, further improves robustness under heterogeneous data conditions. Overall, the study highlights the complementarity between structural modeling, interpretability, and robustness, and discusses the trade-offs between accuracy, model complexity, and transparency in graph-based electricity load forecasting.</p></details> | 22 pages |
| **[Efficient Curvature-aware Graph Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01443v1)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph curvature provides geometric priors for Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), enhancing their ability to model complex graph structures, particularly in terms of structural awareness, robustness, and theoretical interpretability. Among existing methods, Ollivier-Ricci curvature has been extensively studied due to its strong geometric interpretability, effectively characterizing the local geometric distribution between nodes. However, its prohibitively high computational complexity limits its applicability to large-scale graph datasets. To address this challenge, we propose a novel graph curvature measure--Effective Resistance Curvature--which quantifies the ease of message passing along graph edges using the effective resistance between node pairs, instead of the optimal transport distance. This method significantly outperforms Ollivier-Ricci curvature in computational efficiency while preserving comparable geometric expressiveness. Theoretically, we prove the low computational complexity of effective resistance curvature and establish its substitutability for Ollivier-Ricci curvature. Furthermore, extensive experiments on diverse GNN tasks demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance with Ollivier-Ricci curvature while drastically reducing computational overhead.</p></details> |  |

While Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) provide high-quality socioeconomic data, their spatial coverage is limited and reported coordinates are randomly displaced for privacy, further reducing their quality. We propose a graph-based approach leveraging low-dimensional AlphaEarth satellite embeddings to predict cluster-level wealth indices across Sub-Saharan Africa. By modeling spatial relations between surveyed and unlabeled locations, and by introducing a probabilistic "fuzzy label" loss to account for coordinate displacement, we improve the generalization of wealth predictions beyond existing surveys. Our experiments on 37 DHS datasets (2017-2023) show that incorporating graph structure slightly improves accuracy compared to "image-only" baselines, demonstrating the potential of compact EO embeddings for large-scale socioeconomic mapping.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diffusion-Based Solver for CNF Placement on the Cloud-Continuum](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01343v1)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The placement of Cloud-Native Network Functions (CNFs) across the Cloud-Continuum represents a core challenge in the orchestration of current 5G and future 6G networks. The process involves the placement of interdependent computing tasks, structured as Service Function Chains, over distributed cloud infrastructures. This is achieved while satisfying strict resource, bandwidth and latency constraints. It is acknowledged that classical approaches, including mixed-integer nonlinear programming, heuristics and reinforcement learning are limited in terms of scalability, constraint handling and generalisation capacity. In the present study, a novel theoretical framework is proposed, which is based on Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM) for CNF placement. The present approach proposes a reconceptualisation of placement as a generative graph to assignment task, where the placement problem is encoded as a heterogeneous graph, and a Graph Neural Network denoiser is trained to iteratively refine noisy CNF-to-cloud assignment matrices. The model incorporates constraint-specific losses directly into the loss function, thereby allowing it to learn feasible solution spaces. The integration of the DDPM formulation with structured combinatorial constraints is achieved through a rigorous and systematic approach. Extensive evaluations across diverse topologies have been conducted, which have confirmed that the model consistently produces feasible solutions with orders of magnitude faster inference than MINLP solvers. The results obtained demonstrate the potential of diffusion-based generative modelling for constrained network embedding problems, making an impact towards the practical, scalable orchestration of distributed Cloud-Native Network Functions.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 7 figures.

| **[Graph Neural Network-Based Semi-Supervised Open-Set Fault Diagnosis for Marine Machinery Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01258v1)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, fault diagnosis methods for marine machinery systems based on deep learning models have attracted considerable attention in the shipping industry. Most existing studies assume fault classes are consistent and known between the training and test datasets, and these methods perform well under controlled environment. In practice, however, previously unseen or unknown fault types (i.e., out-of-distribution or open-set observations not present during training) can occur, causing such methods to fail and posing a significant challenge to their widespread industrial deployment. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a semi-supervised open-set fault diagnosis (SOFD) framework that enhances and extends the applicability of deep learning models in open-set fault diagnosis scenarios. The framework includes a reliability subset construction process, which uses a multi-layer fusion feature representation extracted by a supervised feature learning model to select an unlabeled test subset. The labeled training set and pseudo-labeled test subset are then fed into a semi-supervised diagnosis model to learn discriminative features for each class, enabling accurate classification of known faults and effective detection of unknown samples. Experimental results on a public maritime benchmark dataset demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed SOFD framework.</p></details> |  |
| **[KAT-GNN: A Knowledge-Augmented Temporal Graph Neural Network for Risk Prediction in Electronic Health Records](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01249v1)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Clinical risk prediction using electronic health records (EHRs) is vital to facilitate timely interventions and clinical decision support. However, modeling heterogeneous and irregular temporal EHR data presents significant challenges. We propose \textbf{KAT-GNN} (Knowledge-Augmented Temporal Graph Neural Network), a graph-based framework that integrates clinical knowledge and temporal dynamics for risk prediction. KAT-GNN first constructs modality-specific patient graphs from EHRs. These graphs are then augmented using two knowledge sources: (1) ontology-driven edges derived from SNOMED CT and (2) co-occurrence priors extracted from EHRs. Subsequently, a time-aware transformer is employed to capture longitudinal dynamics from the graph-encoded patient representations. KAT-GNN is evaluated on three distinct datasets and tasks: coronary artery disease (CAD) prediction using the Chang Gung Research Database (CGRD) and in-hospital mortality prediction using the MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV datasets. KAT-GNN achieves state-of-the-art performance in CAD prediction (AUROC: 0.9269 $\pm$ 0.0029) and demonstrated strong results in mortality prediction in MIMIC-III (AUROC: 0.9230 $\pm$ 0.0070) and MIMIC-IV (AUROC: 0.8849 $\pm$ 0.0089), consistently outperforming established baselines such as GRASP and RETAIN. Ablation studies confirm that both knowledge-based augmentation and the temporal modeling component are significant contributors to performance gains. These findings demonstrate that the integration of clinical knowledge into graph representations, coupled with a time-aware attention mechanism, provides an effective and generalizable approach for risk prediction across diverse clinical tasks and datasets.</p></details> | 10 pages, 3 figures |
| **[WindMiL: Equivariant Graph Learning for Wind Loading Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01226v1)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate prediction of wind loading on buildings is crucial for structural safety and sustainable design, yet conventional approaches such as wind tunnel testing and large-eddy simulation (LES) are prohibitively expensive for large-scale exploration. Each LES case typically requires at least 24 hours of computation, making comprehensive parametric studies infeasible. We introduce WindMiL, a new machine learning framework that combines systematic dataset generation with symmetry-aware graph neural networks (GNNs). First, we introduce a large-scale dataset of wind loads on low-rise buildings by applying signed distance function interpolation to roof geometries and simulating 462 cases with LES across varying shapes and wind directions. Second, we develop a reflection-equivariant GNN that guarantees physically consistent predictions under mirrored geometries. Across interpolation and extrapolation evaluations, WindMiL achieves high accuracy for both the mean and the standard deviation of surface pressure coefficients (e.g., RMSE $\leq 0.02$ for mean $C_p$) and remains accurate under reflected-test evaluation, maintaining hit rates above $96\%$ where the non-equivariant baseline model drops by more than $10\%$. By pairing a systematic dataset with an equivariant surrogate, WindMiL enables efficient, scalable, and accurate predictions of wind loads on buildings.</p></details> |  |

Despite decades of research and numerous imputation methods, the literature remains fragmented across fields, creating a critical need for a comprehensive synthesis that connects statistical foundations with modern machine learning advances. This work systematically reviews core concepts-including missingness mechanisms, single versus multiple imputation, and different imputation goals-and examines problem characteristics across various domains. It provides a thorough categorization of imputation methods, spanning classical techniques (e.g., regression, the EM algorithm) to modern approaches like low-rank and high-rank matrix completion, deep learning models (autoencoders, GANs, diffusion models, graph neural networks), and large language models. Special attention is given to methods for complex data types, such as tensors, time series, streaming data, graph-structured data, categorical data, and multimodal data. Beyond methodology, we investigate the crucial integration of imputation with downstream tasks like classification, clustering, and anomaly detection, examining both sequential pipelines and joint optimization frameworks. The review also assesses theoretical guarantees, benchmarking resources, and evaluation metrics. Finally, we identify critical challenges and future directions, emphasizing model selection and hyperparameter optimization, the growing importance of privacy-preserving imputation via federated learning, and the pursuit of generalizable models that can adapt across domains and data types, thereby outlining a roadmap for future research.</p></details> |  |

However, recent theoretical advances have identified fundamental limitations in their information propagation capabilities, such as over-squashing, where distant nodes fail to effectively exchange information. While extensively studied in static contexts, this issue remains unexplored in Spatiotemporal GNNs (STGNNs), which process sequences associated with graph nodes. Nonetheless, the temporal dimension amplifies this challenge by increasing the information that must be propagated. In this work, we formalize the spatiotemporal over-squashing problem and demonstrate its distinct characteristics compared to the static case. Our analysis reveals that, counterintuitively, convolutional STGNNs favor information propagation from points temporally distant rather than close in time. Moreover, we prove that architectures that follow either time-and-space or time-then-space processing paradigms are equally affected by this phenomenon, providing theoretical justification for computationally efficient implementations. We validate our findings on synthetic and real-world datasets, providing deeper insights into their operational dynamics and principled guidance for more effective designs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

Traditional retrieval methods are constrained by database coverage and quality. Recent Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) enable direct location reasoning from image content, yet individual models struggle with diverse geographic regions and complex scenes. Existing multi-agent systems improve performance through model collaboration but treat all agent interactions uniformly. They lack mechanisms to handle conflicting predictions effectively. We propose \textbf{GraphGeo}, a multi-agent debate framework using heterogeneous graph neural networks for visual geo-localization. Our approach models diverse debate relationships through typed edges, distinguishing supportive collaboration, competitive argumentation, and knowledge transfer. We introduce a dual-level debate mechanism combining node-level refinement and edge-level argumentation modeling. A cross-level topology refinement strategy enables co-evolution between graph structure and agent representations. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate GraphGeo significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Our framework transforms cognitive conflicts between agents into enhanced geo-localization accuracy through structured debate.</p></details> |  |

However, due to the biases in the graph structures, graph neural networks face significant challenges in fairness. Although the original user graph structure is generally biased, it is promising to guide these existing structures toward unbiased ones by introducing new links. The fairness guidance via new links could foster unbiased communities, thereby enhancing fairness in downstream applications. To address this issue, we propose a novel framework named FairGuide. Specifically, to ensure fairness in downstream tasks trained on fairness-guided graphs, we introduce a differentiable community detection task as a pseudo downstream task. Our theoretical analysis further demonstrates that optimizing fairness within this pseudo task effectively enhances structural fairness, promoting fairness generalization across diverse downstream applications. Moreover, FairGuide employs an effective strategy which leverages meta-gradients derived from the fairness-guidance objective to identify new links that significantly enhance structural fairness. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of our proposed method across a variety of graph-based fairness tasks.</p></details> |  |

To support scalability, the bandwidth allocation policy is represented by a graph neural network (GNN), with which the number of training parameters does not change with the number of users. To enable the generalization of the GNN, we develop a hybrid-task meta-learning (HML) algorithm that trains the initial parameters of the GNN with different communication scenarios during meta-training. Next, during meta-testing, a few samples are used to fine-tune the GNN with unseen communication scenarios. Simulation results demonstrate that our HML approach can improve the initial performance by 8.79%, and sample efficiency by 73%, compared with existing benchmarks. After fine-tuning, our near-optimal GNN-based policy can achieve close to the same reward with much lower inference complexity compared to the optimal policy obtained using iterative optimization. Numerical results validate that our HML can reduce the computation time by approximately 200 to 2000 times than the optimal iterative algorithm.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Repetition-Invariant Representations for Polymer Informatics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10726v2)** | 2025-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Polymers are large macromolecules composed of repeating structural units known as monomers and are widely applied in fields such as energy storage, construction, medicine, and aerospace. However, existing graph neural network methods, though effective for small molecules, only model the single unit of polymers and fail to produce consistent vector representations for the true polymer structure with varying numbers of units. To address this challenge, we introduce Graph Repetition Invariance (GRIN), a novel method to learn polymer representations that are invariant to the number of repeating units in their graph representations. GRIN integrates a graph-based maximum spanning tree alignment with repeat-unit augmentation to ensure structural consistency. We provide theoretical guarantees for repetition-invariance from both model and data perspectives, demonstrating that three repeating units are the minimal augmentation required for optimal invariant representation learning. GRIN outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on both homopolymer and copolymer benchmarks, learning stable, repetition-invariant representations that generalize effectively to polymer chains of unseen sizes.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

However, current methods often overlook the critical importance of preserving symmetry when generating scene graphs from 3D point clouds, which can lead to reduced accuracy and robustness, particularly when dealing with noisy, multi-view data. Furthermore, a major limitation of prior approaches is the lack of temporal modeling to capture time-dependent relationships among dynamically evolving entities in a scene. To address these challenges, we propose Temporal Equivariant Scene Graph Neural Network (TESGNN), consisting of two key components: (1) an Equivariant Scene Graph Neural Network (ESGNN), which extracts information from 3D point clouds to generate scene graph while preserving crucial symmetry properties, and (2) a Temporal Graph Matching Network, which fuses scene graphs generated by ESGNN across multiple time sequences into a unified global representation using an approximate graph-matching algorithm. Our combined architecture TESGNN shown to be effective compared to existing methods in scene graph generation, achieving higher accuracy and faster training convergence. Moreover, we show that leveraging the symmetry-preserving property produces a more stable and accurate global scene representation compared to existing approaches. Finally, it is computationally efficient and easily implementable using existing frameworks, making it well-suited for real-time applications in robotics and computer vision. This approach paves the way for more robust and scalable solutions to complex multi-view scene understanding challenges.

| **[Can Classic GNNs Be Strong Baselines for Graph-level Tasks? Simple Architectures Meet Excellence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09263v3)** | 2025-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Message-passing Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are often criticized for their limited expressiveness, issues like over-smoothing and over-squashing, and challenges in capturing long-range dependencies. Conversely, Graph Transformers (GTs) are regarded as superior due to their employment of global attention mechanisms, which potentially mitigate these challenges. Literature frequently suggests that GTs outperform GNNs in graph-level tasks, especially for graph classification and regression on small molecular graphs. In this study, we explore the untapped potential of GNNs through an enhanced framework, GNN+, which integrates six widely used techniques: edge feature integration, normalization, dropout, residual connections, feed-forward networks, and positional encoding, to effectively tackle graph-level tasks. We conduct a systematic re-evaluation of three classic GNNs (GCN, GIN, and GatedGCN) enhanced by the GNN+ framework across 14 well-known graph-level datasets. Our results reveal that, contrary to prevailing beliefs, these classic GNNs consistently match or surpass the performance of GTs, securing top-three rankings across all datasets and achieving first place in eight. Furthermore, they demonstrate greater efficiency, running several times faster than GTs on many datasets. This highlights the potential of simple GNN architectures, challenging the notion that complex mechanisms in GTs are essential for superior graph-level performance.

The problem is challenging in decentralized settings with robots that have limited communication and sensing capabilities. We propose a learnable Perception-Action-Communication (LPAC) architecture for the problem, wherein a convolutional neural network (CNN) processes localized perception; a graph neural network (GNN) facilitates robot communications; finally, a shallow multi-layer perceptron (MLP) computes robot actions. The GNN enables collaboration in the robot swarm by computing what information to communicate with nearby robots and how to incorporate received information. Evaluations show that the LPAC models -- trained using imitation learning -- outperform standard decentralized and centralized coverage control algorithms. The learned policy generalizes to environments different from the training dataset, transfers to larger environments with more robots, and is robust to noisy position estimates. The results indicate the suitability of LPAC architectures for decentralized navigation in robot swarms to achieve collaborative behavior.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 Pa...</summary><p>20 Pages, 20 figures,</p></details> |
| **[Learning Sparse Approximate Inverse Preconditioners for Conjugate Gradient Solvers on GPUs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27517v1)** | 2025-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The conjugate gradient solver (CG) is a prevalent method for solving symmetric and positive definite linear systems Ax=b, where effective preconditioners are crucial for fast convergence. Traditional preconditioners rely on prescribed algorithms to offer rigorous theoretical guarantees, while limiting their ability to exploit optimization from data. Existing learning-based methods often utilize Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to improve the performance and speed up the construction. However, their reliance on incomplete factorization leads to significant challenges: the associated triangular solve hinders GPU parallelization in practice, and introduces long-range dependencies which are difficult for GNNs to model. To address these issues, we propose a learning-based method to generate GPU-friendly preconditioners, particularly using GNNs to construct Sparse Approximate Inverse (SPAI) preconditioners, which avoids triangular solves and requires only two matrix-vector products at each CG step. The locality of matrix-vector product is compatible with the local propagation mechanism of GNNs. The flexibility of GNNs also allows our approach to be applied in a wide range of scenarios. Furthermore, we introduce a statistics-based scale-invariant loss function. Its design matches CG's property that the convergence rate depends on the condition number, rather than the absolute scale of A, leading to improved performance of the learned preconditioner. Evaluations on three PDE-derived datasets and one synthetic dataset demonstrate that our method outperforms standard preconditioners (Diagonal, IC, and traditional SPAI) and previous learning-based preconditioners on GPUs. We reduce solution time on GPUs by 40%-53% (68%-113% faster), along with better condition numbers and superior generalization performance.

| **[Spectral Neural Graph Sparsification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27474v1)** | 2025-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graphs are central to modeling complex systems in domains such as social networks, molecular chemistry, and neuroscience. While Graph Neural Networks, particularly Graph Convolutional Networks, have become standard tools for graph learning, they remain constrained by reliance on fixed structures and susceptibility to over-smoothing. We propose the Spectral Preservation Network, a new framework for graph representation learning that generates reduced graphs serving as faithful proxies of the original, enabling downstream tasks such as community detection, influence propagation, and information diffusion at a reduced computational cost. The Spectral Preservation Network introduces two key components: the Joint Graph Evolution layer and the Spectral Concordance loss. The former jointly transforms both the graph topology and the node feature matrix, allowing the structure and attributes to evolve adaptively across layers and overcoming the rigidity of static neighborhood aggregation. The latter regularizes these transformations by enforcing consistency in both the spectral properties of the graph and the feature vectors of the nodes. We evaluate the effectiveness of Spectral Preservation Network on node-level sparsification by analyzing well-established metrics and benchmarking against state-of-the-art methods. The experimental results demonstrate the superior performance and clear advantages of our approach.</p></details> |  |

Motivated by the prevalence of large datasets in real-world applications, pooling layers are crucial components of GNNs. By reducing the size of input graphs, pooling enables faster training and potentially better generalisation. However, existing pooling operations often optimise for the learning task at the expense of discarding fundamental graph structures, thus reducing interpretability. This leads to unreliable performance across dataset types, downstream tasks and pooling ratios. Addressing these concerns, we propose novel graph pooling layers for structure-aware pooling via edge collapses. Our methods leverage diffusion geometry and iteratively reduce a graph's size while preserving both its metric structure and its structural diversity. We guide pooling using magnitude, an isometry-invariant diversity measure, which permits us to control the fidelity of the pooling process. Further, we use the spread of a metric space as a faster and more stable alternative ensuring computational efficiency. Empirical results demonstrate that our methods (i) achieve top performance compared to alternative pooling layers across a range of diverse graph classification tasks, (ii) preserve key spectral properties of the input graphs, and (iii) retain high accuracy across varying pooling ratios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the 39th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS) 2025.

| **[Multi-Modal Feature Fusion for Spatial Morphology Analysis of Traditional Villages via Hierarchical Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27208v1)** | 2025-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Villages areas hold significant importance in the study of human-land relationships. However, with the advancement of urbanization, the gradual disappearance of spatial characteristics and the homogenization of landscapes have emerged as prominent issues. Existing studies primarily adopt a single-disciplinary perspective to analyze villages spatial morphology and its influencing factors, relying heavily on qualitative analysis methods. These efforts are often constrained by the lack of digital infrastructure and insufficient data. To address the current research limitations, this paper proposes a Hierarchical Graph Neural Network (HGNN) model that integrates multi-source data to conduct an in-depth analysis of villages spatial morphology. The framework includes two types of nodes-input nodes and communication nodes-and two types of edges-static input edges and dynamic communication edges. By combining Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) and Graph Attention Networks (GAT), the proposed model efficiently integrates multimodal features under a two-stage feature update mechanism. Additionally, based on existing principles for classifying villages spatial morphology, the paper introduces a relational pooling mechanism and implements a joint training strategy across 17 subtypes. Experimental results demonstrate that this method achieves significant performance improvements over existing approaches in multimodal fusion and classification tasks. Additionally, the proposed joint optimization of all sub-types lifts mean accuracy/F1 from 0.71/0.83 (independent models) to 0.82/0.90, driven by a 6% gain for parcel tasks. Our method provides scientific evidence for exploring villages spatial patterns and generative logic.</p></details> |  |

Traditional accident prediction models treat road segments independently, failing to capture complex spatial relationships and temporal dependencies in urban transportation networks. This study develops MDAS-GNN, a Multi-Dimensional Attention-based Spatial-diffusion Graph Neural Network integrating three core risk dimensions: traffic safety, infrastructure, and environmental risk. The framework employs feature-specific spatial diffusion mechanisms and multi-head temporal attention to capture dependencies across different time horizons. Evaluated on UK Department for Transport accident data across Central London, South Manchester, and SE Birmingham, MDASGNN achieves superior performance compared to established baseline methods. The model maintains consistently low prediction errors across short, medium, and long-term periods, with particular strength in long-term forecasting. Ablation studies confirm that integrated multi-dimensional features outperform singlefeature approaches, reducing prediction errors by up to 40%. This framework provides civil engineers and urban planners with advanced predictive capabilities for transportation infrastructure design, enabling data-driven decisions for road network optimization, infrastructure resource improvements, and strategic safety interventions in urban development projects.</p></details> |  |
| **[MeixnerNet: Adaptive and Robust Spectral Graph Neural Networks with Discrete Orthogonal Polynomials](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00113v1)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spectral Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art results by defining graph convolutions in the spectral domain. A common approach, popularized by ChebyNet, is to use polynomial filters based on continuous orthogonal polynomials (e.g., Chebyshev). This creates a theoretical disconnect, as these continuous-domain filters are applied to inherently discrete graph structures. We hypothesize this mismatch can lead to suboptimal performance and fragility to hyperparameter settings. In this paper, we introduce MeixnerNet, a novel spectral GNN architecture that employs discrete orthogonal polynomials -- specifically, the Meixner polynomials $M_k(x; \beta, c)$. Our model makes the two key shape parameters of the polynomial, beta and c, learnable, allowing the filter to adapt its polynomial basis to the specific spectral properties of a given graph. We overcome the significant numerical instability of these polynomials by introducing a novel stabilization technique that combines Laplacian scaling with per-basis LayerNorm. We demonstrate experimentally that MeixnerNet achieves competitive-to-superior performance against the strong ChebyNet baseline at the optimal K = 2 setting (winning on 2 out of 3 benchmarks). More critically, we show that MeixnerNet is exceptionally robust to variations in the polynomial degree K, a hyperparameter to which ChebyNet proves to be highly fragile, collapsing in performance where MeixnerNet remains stable.</p></details> |  |

Traditional models often fail to effectively capture complex spatial-temporal dependencies in large-scale road networks, especially under the influence of external factors such as weather, holidays, and traffic accidents. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a cloud-based hybrid model that integrates Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Networks (ST-GNN) with a Transformer architecture for traffic flow prediction. The model leverages the strengths of GNNs in modeling spatial correlations across road networks and the Transformers' ability to capture long-term temporal dependencies. External contextual features are incorporated via feature fusion to enhance predictive accuracy. The proposed model is deployed on a cloud computing platform to achieve scalability and real-time adaptability. Experimental evaluation of the dataset shows that our model outperforms baseline methods (LSTM, TCN, GCN, pure Transformer) with an RMSE of only 17.92 and a MAE of only 10.53. These findings suggest that the hybrid GNN-Transformer approach provides an effective and scalable solution for cloud-based ITS applications, offering methodological advancements for traffic flow forecasting and practical implications for congestion mitigation.</p></details> |  |

Motivated by the manifold hypothesis, we model data as points sampled from a low-dimensional manifold $\mathcal{M} \subset \mathbb{R}^F$. The manifold is approximated in an unsupervised manner using a variational autoencoder (VAE), where the trained encoder maps data to embeddings that represent their coordinates in $\mathbb{R}^F$. A geometric graph is constructed with Gaussian-weighted edges inversely proportional to distances in the embedding space, transforming the point classification problem into a semi-supervised node classification task on the graph. This task is solved using a graph neural network (GNN). Our main contribution is a theoretical analysis of the statistical generalization properties of this data-to-manifold-to-graph pipeline. We show that, under uniform sampling from $\mathcal{M}$, the generalization gap of the semi-supervised task diminishes with increasing graph size, up to the GNN training error. Leveraging a training procedure which resamples a slightly larger graph at regular intervals during training, we then show that the generalization gap can be reduced even further, vanishing asymptotically. Finally, we validate our findings with numerical experiments on image classification benchmarks, demonstrating the empirical effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> | 16 pages, 3 figures |

Existing methods to model such dynamics typically rely on manually-defined or heuristic hierarchies with fixed motion primitives, limiting their generalizability across different tasks. In this work, we propose a general hierarchical motion modeling method that learns structured, interpretable motion relationships directly from data. Our method represents observed motions using graph-based hierarchies, explicitly decomposing global absolute motions into parent-inherited patterns and local motion residuals. We formulate hierarchy inference as a differentiable graph learning problem, where vertices represent elemental motions and directed edges capture learned parent-child dependencies through graph neural networks. We evaluate our hierarchical reconstruction approach on three examples: 1D translational motion, 2D rotational motion, and dynamic 3D scene deformation via Gaussian splatting. Experimental results show that our method reconstructs the intrinsic motion hierarchy in 1D and 2D cases, and produces more realistic and interpretable deformations compared to the baseline on dynamic 3D Gaussian splatting scenes. By providing an adaptable, data-driven hierarchical modeling paradigm, our method offers a formulation applicable to a broad range of motion-centric tasks.

Besides working well in practical settings, their ability to generalize beyond the training set remains poorly understood. While some studies have explored MPNNs' generalization in graph-level prediction tasks, much less attention has been given to node- and link-level predictions. Existing works often rely on unrealistic i.i.d.\@ assumptions, overlooking possible correlations between nodes or links, and assuming fixed aggregation and impractical loss functions while neglecting the influence of graph structure. In this work, we introduce a unified framework to analyze the generalization properties of MPNNs in inductive and transductive node and link prediction settings, incorporating diverse architectural parameters and loss functions and quantifying the influence of graph structure. Additionally, our proposed generalization framework can be applied beyond graphs to any classification task under the inductive or transductive setting.

| **[UnifiedFL: A Dynamic Unified Learning Framework for Equitable Federation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26350v1)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a key paradigm for collaborative model training across multiple clients without sharing raw data, enabling privacy-preserving applications in areas such as radiology and pathology. However, works on collaborative training across clients with fundamentally different neural architectures and non-identically distributed datasets remain scarce. Existing FL frameworks face several limitations. Despite claiming to support architectural heterogeneity, most recent FL methods only tolerate variants within a single model family (e.g., shallower, deeper, or wider CNNs), still presuming a shared global architecture and failing to accommodate federations where clients deploy fundamentally different network types (e.g., CNNs, GNNs, MLPs). Moreover, existing approaches often address only statistical heterogeneity while overlooking the domain-fracture problem, where each client's data distribution differs markedly from that faced at testing time, undermining model generalizability. When clients use different architectures, have non-identically distributed data, and encounter distinct test domains, current methods perform poorly. To address these challenges, we propose UnifiedFL, a dynamic federated learning framework that represents heterogeneous local networks as nodes and edges in a directed model graph optimized by a shared graph neural network (GNN). UnifiedFL introduces (i) a common GNN to parameterize all architectures, (ii) distance-driven clustering via Euclidean distances between clients' parameters, and (iii) a two-tier aggregation policy balancing convergence and diversity. Experiments on MedMNIST classification and hippocampus segmentation benchmarks demonstrate UnifiedFL's superior performance. Code and data: https://github.com/basiralab/UnifiedFL</p></details> |  |

However, non-uniform interactions and random topologies make this task challenging. We address these challenges by proposing \textit{Graph Controllable Embeddings} (GCE), a general framework to learn stochastic multi-object dynamics for linear control. Specifically, GCE is built on Hilbert space embeddings, allowing direct embedding of probability distributions of controlled stochastic dynamics into a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), which enables linear operations in its RKHS while retaining nonlinear expressiveness. We provide theoretical guarantees on the existence, convergence, and applicability of GCE. Notably, a mean field approximation technique is adopted to efficiently capture inter-object dependencies and achieve provably low sample complexity. By integrating graph neural networks, we construct data-dependent kernel features that are capable of adapting to dynamic interaction patterns and generalizing to even unseen topologies with only limited training instances. GCE scales seamlessly to multi-object systems of varying sizes and topologies. Leveraging the linearity of Hilbert spaces, GCE also supports simple yet effective control algorithms for synthesizing optimal sequences. Experiments on physical systems, robotics, and power grids validate GCE and demonstrate consistent performance improvement over various competitive embedding methods in both in-distribution and few-shot tests</p></details> |  |

Graph-based approaches have become increasingly important for modeling entity interactions, yet most rely on homogeneous and static structures, which limits their ability to capture the heterogeneity and temporal evolution of real-world environments. Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs) have emerged as a promising paradigm for anomaly detection by incorporating type-aware transformations and relation-sensitive aggregation, enabling more expressive modeling of complex cyber data. However, current research on HGNN-based anomaly detection remains fragmented, with diverse modeling strategies, limited comparative evaluation, and an absence of standardized benchmarks. To address this gap, we provide a comprehensive survey of HGNN-based anomaly detection methods in cybersecurity. We introduce a taxonomy that classifies approaches by anomaly type and graph dynamics, analyze representative models, and map them to key cybersecurity applications. We also review commonly used benchmark datasets and evaluation metrics, highlighting their strengths and limitations. Finally, we identify key open challenges related to modeling, data, and deployment, and outline promising directions for future research. This survey aims to establish a structured foundation for advancing HGNN-based anomaly detection toward scalable, interpretable, and practically deployable solutions.</p></details> | <details><summary>37 pa...</summary><p>37 pages, 4 figures, 86 references.

This paper introduces a morphology-aware reinforcement learning framework that integrates a graph neural network (GNN) into the Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm. By representing the robot's physical topology as a graph, the proposed GNN-based policy captures coupling among components, enabling faster and more stable learning than conventional multilayer perceptron (MLP) policies. The method is validated on a physical 3-bar tensegrity robot across three locomotion primitives, including straight-line tracking and bidirectional turning. It shows superior sample efficiency, robustness to noise and stiffness variations, and improved trajectory accuracy. Notably, the learned policies transfer directly from simulation to hardware without fine-tuning, achieving stable real-world locomotion.

A graph neural network-based model is designed to generate projections tailored to each QP instance, enabling us to produce high-quality solutions even for previously unseen problems. The model is trained on heterogeneous QPs to minimize the expected objective value evaluated on the projected solutions. This is formulated as a bilevel optimization problem; the inner optimization solves the QP under a given projection using a QP solver, while the outer optimization updates the model parameters. We develop an efficient algorithm to solve this bilevel optimization problem, which computes parameter gradients without backpropagating through the solver. We provide a theoretical analysis of the generalization ability of solving QPs with projection matrices generated by neural networks. Experimental results demonstrate that our method produces high-quality feasible solutions with reduced computation time, outperforming existing methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hierarchical Graph Networks for Accurate Weather Forecasting via Lightweight Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22094v2)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Climate events arise from intricate, multivariate dynamics governed by global-scale drivers, profoundly impacting food, energy, and infrastructure. Yet, accurate weather prediction remains elusive due to physical processes unfolding across diverse spatio-temporal scales, which fixed-resolution methods cannot capture. Hierarchical Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs) offer a multiscale representation, but nonlinear downward mappings often erase global trends, weakening the integration of physics into forecasts. We introduce HiFlowCast and its ensemble variant HiAntFlow, HGNNs that embed physics within a multiscale prediction framework. Two innovations underpin their design: a Latent-Memory-Retention mechanism that preserves global trends during downward traversal, and a Latent-to-Physics branch that integrates PDE solution fields across diverse scales. Our Flow models cut errors by over 5% at 13-day lead times and by 5-8% under 1st and 99th quantile extremes, improving reliability for rare events. Leveraging pretrained model weights, they converge within a single epoch, reducing training cost and their carbon footprint. Such efficiency is vital as the growing scale of machine learning challenges sustainability and limits research accessibility. Code and model weights are in the supplementary materials.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fixed-point graph convolutional networks against adversarial attacks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00083v1)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Adversarial attacks present a significant risk to the integrity and performance of graph neural networks, particularly in tasks where graph structure and node features are vulnerable to manipulation. In this paper, we present a novel model, called fixed-point iterative graph convolutional network (Fix-GCN), which achieves robustness against adversarial perturbations by effectively capturing higher-order node neighborhood information in the graph without additional memory or computational complexity. Specifically, we introduce a versatile spectral modulation filter and derive the feature propagation rule of our model using fixed-point iteration. Unlike traditional defense mechanisms that rely on additional design elements to counteract attacks, the proposed graph filter provides a flexible-pass filtering approach, allowing it to selectively attenuate high-frequency components while preserving low-frequency structural information in the graph signal. By iteratively updating node representations, our model offers a flexible and efficient framework for preserving essential graph information while mitigating the impact of adversarial manipulation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model through extensive experiments on various benchmark graph datasets, showcasing its resilience against adversarial attacks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Robust GNN Watermarking via Implicit Perception of Topological Invariants](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25934v1)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are valuable intellectual property, yet many watermarks rely on backdoor triggers that break under common model edits and create ownership ambiguity. We present InvGNN-WM, which ties ownership to a model's implicit perception of a graph invariant, enabling trigger-free, black-box verification with negligible task impact. A lightweight head predicts normalized algebraic connectivity on an owner-private carrier set; a sign-sensitive decoder outputs bits, and a calibrated threshold controls the false-positive rate. Across diverse node and graph classification datasets and backbones, InvGNN-WM matches clean accuracy while yielding higher watermark accuracy than trigger- and compression-based baselines. It remains strong under unstructured pruning, fine-tuning, and post-training quantization; plain knowledge distillation (KD) weakens the mark, while KD with a watermark loss (KD+WM) restores it. We provide guarantees for imperceptibility and robustness, and we prove that exact removal is NP-complete.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph Network-based Structural Simulator: Graph Neural Networks for Structural Dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25683v1)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have recently been explored as surrogate models for numerical simulations. While their applications in computational fluid dynamics have been investigated, little attention has been given to structural problems, especially for dynamic cases. To address this gap, we introduce the Graph Network-based Structural Simulator (GNSS), a GNN framework for surrogate modeling of dynamic structural problems. GNSS follows the encode-process-decode paradigm typical of GNN-based machine learning models, and its design makes it particularly suited for dynamic simulations thanks to three key features: (i) expressing node kinematics in node-fixed local frames, which avoids catastrophic cancellation in finite-difference velocities; (ii) employing a sign-aware regression loss, which reduces phase errors in long rollouts; and (iii) using a wavelength-informed connectivity radius, which optimizes graph construction. We evaluate GNSS on a case study involving a beam excited by a 50kHz Hanning-modulated pulse. The results show that GNSS accurately reproduces the physics of the problem over hundreds of timesteps and generalizes to unseen loading conditions, where existing GNNs fail to converge or deliver meaningful predictions. Compared with explicit finite element baselines, GNSS achieves substantial inference speedups while preserving spatial and temporal fidelity. These findings demonstrate that locality-preserving GNNs with physics-consistent update rules are a competitive alternative for dynamic, wave-dominated structural simulations.</p></details> | 16 pages, 14 figures |
| **[A method for the systematic generation of graph XAI benchmarks via Weisfeiler-Leman coloring](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12437v2)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks have become the de facto model for learning from structured data. However, the decision-making process of GNNs remains opaque to the end user, which undermines their use in safety-critical applications. Several explainable AI techniques for graphs have been developed to address this major issue. Focusing on graph classification, these explainers identify subgraph motifs that explain predictions. Therefore, a robust benchmarking of graph explainers is required to ensure that the produced explanations are of high quality, i.e., aligned with the GNN's decision process. However, current graph-XAI benchmarks are limited to simplistic synthetic datasets or a few real-world tasks curated by domain experts, hindering rigorous and reproducible evaluation, and consequently stalling progress in the field. To overcome these limitations, we propose a method to automate the construction of graph XAI benchmarks from generic graph classification datasets. Our approach leverages the Weisfeiler-Leman color refinement algorithm to efficiently perform approximate subgraph matching and mine class-discriminating motifs, which serve as proxy ground-truth class explanations. At the same time, we ensure that these motifs can be learned by GNNs because their discriminating power aligns with WL expressiveness. This work also introduces the OpenGraphXAI benchmark suite, which consists of 15 ready-made graph-XAI datasets derived by applying our method to real-world molecular classification datasets. The suite is available to the public along with a codebase to generate over 2,000 additional graph-XAI benchmarks. Finally, we present a use case that illustrates how the suite can be used to assess the effectiveness of a selection of popular graph explainers, demonstrating the critical role of a sufficiently large benchmark collection for improving the significance of experimental results.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exploring End-to-end Differentiable Neural Charged Particle Tracking -- A Loss Landscape Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13420v2)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Measurement and analysis of high energetic particles for scientific, medical or industrial applications is a complex procedure, requiring the design of sophisticated detector and data processing systems. The development of adaptive and differentiable software pipelines using a combination of conventional and machine learning algorithms is therefore getting ever more important to optimize and operate the system efficiently while maintaining end-to-end (E2E) differentiability. We propose for the application of charged particle tracking an E2E differentiable decision-focused learning scheme using graph neural networks with combinatorial components solving a linear assignment problem for each detector layer. We demonstrate empirically that including differentiable variations of discrete assignment operations allows for efficient network optimization, working better or on par with approaches that lack E2E differentiability. In additional studies, we dive deeper into the optimization process and provide further insights from a loss landscape perspective. We demonstrate that while both methods converge into similar performing, globally well-connected regions, they suffer under substantial predictive instability across initialization and optimization methods, which can have unpredictable consequences on the performance of downstream tasks such as image reconstruction. We also point out a dependency between the interpolation factor of the gradient estimator and the prediction stability of the model, suggesting the choice of sufficiently small values. Given the strong global connectivity of learned solutions and the excellent training performance, we argue that E2E differentiability provides, besides the general availability of gradient information, an important tool for robust particle tracking to mitigate prediction instabilities by favoring solutions that perform well on downstream tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in Transactions on Machine Learning Research (TMLR), 2025</p></details> |
| **[GnnXemplar: Exemplars to Explanations -- Natural Language Rules for Global GNN Interpretability](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18376v2)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are widely used for node classification, yet their opaque decision-making limits trust and adoption. While local explanations offer insights into individual predictions, global explanation methods, those that characterize an entire class, remain underdeveloped. Existing global explainers rely on motif discovery in small graphs, an approach that breaks down in large, real-world settings where subgraph repetition is rare, node attributes are high-dimensional, and predictions arise from complex structure-attribute interactions. We propose GnnXemplar, a novel global explainer inspired from Exemplar Theory from cognitive science. GnnXemplar identifies representative nodes in the GNN embedding space, exemplars, and explains predictions using natural language rules derived from their neighborhoods. Exemplar selection is framed as a coverage maximization problem over reverse k-nearest neighbors, for which we provide an efficient greedy approximation. To derive interpretable rules, we employ a self-refining prompt strategy using large language models (LLMs). Experiments across diverse benchmarks show that GnnXemplar significantly outperforms existing methods in fidelity, scalability, and human interpretability, as validated by a user study with 60 participants.</p></details> | <details><summary>38 pa...</summary><p>38 pages, 20 figures, NeurIPS 2025 (Oral)</p></details> |
| **[FastJAM: a Fast Joint Alignment Model for Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22842v2)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Joint Alignment (JA) of images aims to align a collection of images into a unified coordinate frame, such that semantically-similar features appear at corresponding spatial locations. Most existing approaches often require long training times, large-capacity models, and extensive hyperparameter tuning. We introduce FastJAM, a rapid, graph-based method that drastically reduces the computational complexity of joint alignment tasks. FastJAM leverages pairwise matches computed by an off-the-shelf image matcher, together with a rapid nonparametric clustering, to construct a graph representing intra- and inter-image keypoint relations. A graph neural network propagates and aggregates these correspondences, efficiently predicting per-image homography parameters via image-level pooling. Utilizing an inverse-compositional loss, that eliminates the need for a regularization term over the predicted transformations (and thus also obviates the hyperparameter tuning associated with such terms), FastJAM performs image JA quickly and effectively. Experimental results on several benchmarks demonstrate that FastJAM achieves results better than existing modern JA methods in terms of alignment quality, while reducing computation time from hours or minutes to mere seconds.

| **[Expand and Compress: Exploring Tuning Principles for Continual Spatio-Temporal Graph Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12593v3)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The widespread deployment of sensing devices leads to a surge in data for spatio-temporal forecasting applications such as traffic flow, air quality, and wind energy. Although spatio-temporal graph neural networks have achieved success in modeling various static spatio-temporal forecasting scenarios, real-world spatio-temporal data are typically received in a streaming manner, and the network continuously expands with the installation of new sensors. Thus, spatio-temporal forecasting in streaming scenarios faces dual challenges: the inefficiency of retraining models over newly arrived data and the detrimental effects of catastrophic forgetting over long-term history. To address these challenges, we propose a novel prompt tuning-based continuous forecasting method, following two fundamental tuning principles guided by empirical and theoretical analysis: expand and compress, which effectively resolve the aforementioned problems with lightweight tuning parameters. Specifically, we integrate the base spatio-temporal graph neural network with a continuous prompt pool, utilizing stored prompts (i.e., few learnable parameters) in memory, and jointly optimize them with the base spatio-temporal graph neural network. This method ensures that the model sequentially learns from the spatio-temporal data stream to accomplish tasks for corresponding periods. Extensive experimental results on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate the multi-faceted superiority of our method over the state-of-the-art baselines, including effectiveness, efficiency, universality, etc.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICLR 2025</p></details> |
| **[S'MoRE: Structural Mixture of Residual Experts for Parameter-Efficient LLM Fine-tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06426v2)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fine-tuning pre-trained large language models (LLMs) presents a dual challenge of balancing parameter efficiency and model capacity. Existing methods like low-rank adaptations (LoRA) are efficient but lack flexibility, while Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) enhance model capacity at the cost of more & under-utilized parameters. To address these limitations, we propose Structural Mixture of Residual Experts (S'MoRE), a novel framework that seamlessly integrates the efficiency of LoRA with the flexibility of MoE. Conceptually, S'MoRE employs hierarchical low-rank decomposition of expert weights, yielding residuals of varying orders interconnected in a multi-layer structure. By routing input tokens through sub-trees of residuals, S'MoRE emulates the capacity of numerous experts by instantiating and assembling just a few low-rank matrices. We craft the inter-layer propagation of S'MoRE's residuals as a special type of Graph Neural Network (GNN), and prove that under similar parameter budget, S'MoRE improves structural flexibility of traditional MoE (or Mixture-of-LoRA) by exponential order. Comprehensive theoretical analysis and empirical results demonstrate that S'MoRE achieves superior fine-tuning performance, offering a transformative approach for efficient LLM adaptation. Our implementation is available at: https://github.com/ZimpleX/SMoRE-LLM.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 |
| **[Plexus: Taming Billion-edge Graphs with 3D Parallel Full-graph GNN Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04083v2)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) leverage the connectivity and structure of real-world graphs to learn intricate properties and relationships between nodes. Many real-world graphs exceed the memory capacity of a GPU due to their sheer size, and training GNNs on such graphs requires techniques such as mini-batch sampling to scale. The alternative approach of distributed full-graph training suffers from high communication overheads and load imbalance due to the irregular structure of graphs. We propose a three-dimensional (3D) parallel approach for full-graph training that tackles these issues and scales to billion-edge graphs. In addition, we introduce optimizations such as a double permutation scheme for load balancing, and a performance model to predict the optimal 3D configuration of our parallel implementation -- Plexus. We evaluate Plexus on six different graph datasets and show scaling results on up to 2048 GPUs of Perlmutter, and 1024 GPUs of Frontier. Plexus achieves unprecedented speedups of 2.3-12.5x over prior state of the art, and a reduction in time-to-solution by 5.2-8.7x on Perlmutter and 7.0-54.2x on Frontier.</p></details> |  |

By leveraging the comprehensive UNSW-NB15 dataset containing diverse network traffic patterns, our approach effectively captures both spatial dependencies through graph structural relationships and temporal dynamics through sequential analysis of network events. The integrated attention mechanism provides dual benefits of improved model interpretability and enhanced feature selection, enabling cybersecurity analysts to focus computational resources on high-impact security events -- a critical requirement in modern real-time intrusion detection systems. Our extensive experimental evaluation demonstrates that the proposed hybrid model achieves superior performance compared to traditional machine learning approaches and standalone deep learning models across multiple evaluation metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The model achieves particularly strong performance in detecting sophisticated attack patterns such as Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs), Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, and zero-day exploits, making it a promising solution for next-generation cybersecurity applications in complex network environments.</p></details> |  |
