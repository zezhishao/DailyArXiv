This paper proposes an alternative to Poisson autoregressions: count echo state networks. Echo state networks can be statistically analyzed in frequentist manners via optimizing penalized likelihoods, or in Bayesian manners via MCMC sampling. This paper develops Poisson echo state techniques for count data and applies them to a massive count data set containing the number of graduate students from 1,758 United States universities during the years 1972-2021 inclusive. Negative binomial models are also implemented to better handle overdispersion in the counts. Performance of the proposed models are compared via their forecasting performance as judged by several methods. In the end, a hierarchical negative binomial based echo state network is judged as the superior model.</p></details> |  |
| **[Time-MMD: Multi-Domain Multimodal Dataset for Time Series Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08627v4)** | 2025-01-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series data are ubiquitous across a wide range of real-world domains. While real-world time series analysis (TSA) requires human experts to integrate numerical series data with multimodal domain-specific knowledge, most existing TSA models rely solely on numerical data, overlooking the significance of information beyond numerical series. This oversight is due to the untapped potential of textual series data and the absence of a comprehensive, high-quality multimodal dataset. To overcome this obstacle, we introduce Time-MMD, the first multi-domain, multimodal time series dataset covering 9 primary data domains. Time-MMD ensures fine-grained modality alignment, eliminates data contamination, and provides high usability. Additionally, we develop MM-TSFlib, the first-cut multimodal time-series forecasting (TSF) library, seamlessly pipelining multimodal TSF evaluations based on Time-MMD for in-depth analyses. Extensive experiments conducted on Time-MMD through MM-TSFlib demonstrate significant performance enhancements by extending unimodal TSF to multimodality, evidenced by over 15% mean squared error reduction in general, and up to 40% in domains with rich textual data. More importantly, our datasets and library revolutionize broader applications, impacts, research topics to advance TSA. The dataset is available at https://github.com/AdityaLab/Time-MMD.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2024 Datasets and Benchmarks Track</p></details> |
| **[CAMEO: Autocorrelation-Preserving Line Simplification for Lossy Time Series Compression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14432v1)** | 2025-01-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series data from a variety of sensors and IoT devices need effective compression to reduce storage and I/O bandwidth requirements. While most time series databases and systems rely on lossless compression, lossy techniques offer even greater space-saving with a small loss in precision. However, the unknown impact on downstream analytics applications requires a semi-manual trial-and-error exploration. We initiate work on lossy compression that provides guarantees on complex statistical features (which are strongly correlated with the accuracy of the downstream analytics). Specifically, we propose a new lossy compression method that provides guarantees on the autocorrelation and partial-autocorrelation functions (ACF/PACF) of a time series. Our method leverages line simplification techniques as well as incremental maintenance of aggregates, blocking, and parallelization strategies for effective and efficient compression. The results show that our method improves compression ratios by 2x on average and up to 54x on selected datasets, compared to previous lossy and lossless compression methods. Moreover, we maintain -- and sometimes even improve -- the forecasting accuracy by preserving the autocorrelation properties of the time series. Our framework is extensible to multivariate time series and other statistical features of the time series.</p></details> | 14 pages, 13 figures |
| **[CENTS: Generating synthetic electricity consumption time series for rare and unseen scenarios](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14426v1)** | 2025-01-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent breakthroughs in large-scale generative modeling have demonstrated the potential of foundation models in domains such as natural language, computer vision, and protein structure prediction. However, their application in the energy and smart grid sector remains limited due to the scarcity and heterogeneity of high-quality data. In this work, we propose a method for creating high-fidelity electricity consumption time series data for rare and unseen context variables (e.g. location, building type, photovoltaics). Our approach, Context Encoding and Normalizing Time Series Generation, or CENTS, includes three key innovations: (i) A context normalization approach that enables inverse transformation for time series context variables unseen during training, (ii) a novel context encoder to condition any state-of-the-art time-series generator on arbitrary numbers and combinations of context variables, (iii) a framework for training this context encoder jointly with a time-series generator using an auxiliary context classification loss designed to increase expressivity of context embeddings and improve model performance. We further provide a comprehensive overview of different evaluation metrics for generative time series models. Our results highlight the efficacy of the proposed method in generating realistic household-level electricity consumption data, paving the way for training larger foundation models in the energy domain on synthetic as well as real-world data.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Survey on Diffusion Models for Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11430v3)** | 2025-01-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models (DMs) have emerged as a powerful class of generative AI models, showing remarkable potential in anomaly detection (AD) tasks across various domains, such as cybersecurity, fraud detection, healthcare, and manufacturing. The intersection of these two fields, termed diffusion models for anomaly detection (DMAD), offers promising solutions for identifying deviations in increasingly complex and high-dimensional data. In this survey, we review recent advances in DMAD research. We begin by presenting the fundamental concepts of AD and DMs, followed by a comprehensive analysis of classic DM architectures including DDPMs, DDIMs, and Score SDEs. We further categorize existing DMAD methods into reconstruction-based, density-based, and hybrid approaches, providing detailed examinations of their methodological innovations. We also explore the diverse tasks across different data modalities, encompassing image, time series, video, and multimodal data analysis. Furthermore, we discuss critical challenges and emerging research directions, including computational efficiency, model interpretability, robustness enhancement, edge-cloud collaboration, and integration with large language models. The collection of DMAD research papers and resources is available at https://github.com/fdjingliu/DMAD.</p></details> |  |

We hereby allow separate cointegrating relations along the rows and columns of the matrix-valued time series and use information criteria to select the cointegration ranks. Through Monte Carlo simulations and a macroeconomic application, we demonstrate that our approach provides a reliable estimation of the number of cointegrating relationships.</p></details> | 10 pages, 2 figures |
| **[VarDrop: Enhancing Training Efficiency by Reducing Variate Redundancy in Periodic Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14183v1)** | 2025-01-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Variate tokenization, which independently embeds each variate as separate tokens, has achieved remarkable improvements in multivariate time series forecasting. However, employing self-attention with variate tokens incurs a quadratic computational cost with respect to the number of variates, thus limiting its training efficiency for large-scale applications. To address this issue, we propose VarDrop, a simple yet efficient strategy that reduces the token usage by omitting redundant variate tokens during training. VarDrop adaptively excludes redundant tokens within a given batch, thereby reducing the number of tokens used for dot-product attention while preserving essential information. Specifically, we introduce k-dominant frequency hashing (k-DFH), which utilizes the ranked dominant frequencies in the frequency domain as a hash value to efficiently group variate tokens exhibiting similar periodic behaviors. Then, only representative tokens in each group are sampled through stratified sampling. By performing sparse attention with these selected tokens, the computational cost of scaled dot-product attention is significantly alleviated. Experiments conducted on public benchmark datasets demonstrate that VarDrop outperforms existing efficient baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Argos: Agentic Time-Series Anomaly Detection with Autonomous Rule Generation via Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14170v1)** | 2025-01-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Observability in cloud infrastructure is critical for service providers, driving the widespread adoption of anomaly detection systems for monitoring metrics. However, existing systems often struggle to simultaneously achieve explainability, reproducibility, and autonomy, which are three indispensable properties for production use. We introduce Argos, an agentic system for detecting time-series anomalies in cloud infrastructure by leveraging large language models (LLMs). Argos proposes to use explainable and reproducible anomaly rules as intermediate representation and employs LLMs to autonomously generate such rules. The system will efficiently train error-free and accuracy-guaranteed anomaly rules through multiple collaborative agents and deploy the trained rules for low-cost online anomaly detection. Through evaluation results, we demonstrate that Argos outperforms state-of-the-art methods, increasing $F_1$ scores by up to $9.5\%$ and $28.3\%$ on public anomaly detection datasets and an internal dataset collected from Microsoft, respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[Look Into the LITE in Deep Learning for Time Series Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02869v2)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning models have been shown to be a powerful solution for Time Series Classification (TSC). State-of-the-art architectures, while producing promising results on the UCR and the UEA archives , present a high number of trainable parameters. This can lead to long training with high CO2 emission, power consumption and possible increase in the number of FLoating-point Operation Per Second (FLOPS). In this paper, we present a new architecture for TSC, the Light Inception with boosTing tEchnique (LITE) with only 2.34% of the number of parameters of the state-of-the-art InceptionTime model, while preserving performance. This architecture, with only 9, 814 trainable parameters due to the usage of DepthWise Separable Convolutions (DWSC), is boosted by three techniques: multiplexing, custom filters, and dilated convolution. The LITE architecture, trained on the UCR, is 2.78 times faster than InceptionTime and consumes 2.79 times less CO2 and power. To evaluate the performance of the proposed architecture on multivariate time series data, we adapt LITE to handle multivariate time series, we call this version LITEMV. To bring theory into application, we also conducted experiments using LITEMV on multivariate time series representing human rehabilitation movements, showing that LITEMV not only is the most efficient model but also the best performing for this application on the Kimore dataset, a skeleton based human rehabilitation exercises dataset. Moreover, to address the interpretability of LITEMV, we present a study using Class Activation Maps to understand the classification decision taken by the model during evaluation.</p></details> |  |
| **[One Transformer for All Time Series: Representing and Training with Time-Dependent Heterogeneous Tabular Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.06375v3)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>There is a recent growing interest in applying Deep Learning techniques to tabular data, in order to replicate the success of other Artificial Intelligence areas in this structured domain. Specifically interesting is the case in which tabular data have a time dependence, such as, for instance financial transactions. However, the heterogeneity of the tabular values, in which categorical elements are mixed with numerical items, makes this adaptation difficult. In this paper we propose a Transformer architecture to represent heterogeneous time-dependent tabular data, in which numerical features are represented using a set of frequency functions and the whole network is uniformly trained with a unique loss function.</p></details> | <details><summary>29 pa...</summary><p>29 pages, 2 figures, 16 tables</p></details> |
| **[Reconstructing ecological community dynamics from limited observations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03820v3)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ecosystems tend to fluctuate around stable equilibria in response to internal dynamics and environmental factors. Occasionally, they enter an unstable tipping region and collapse into an alternative stable state. Our understanding of how ecological communities vary over time and respond to perturbations depends on our ability to quantify and predict these dynamics. However, the scarcity of long, dense time series data poses a severe bottleneck for characterising community dynamics using existing methods. We overcome this limitation by combining information across multiple short time series using Bayesian inference. By decomposing dynamics into deterministic and stochastic components using Gaussian process priors, we predict stable and tipping regions along the community landscape and quantify resilience while addressing uncertainty. After validation with simulated and real ecological time series, we use the model to question common assumptions underlying classical potential analysis and re-evaluate the stability of previously proposed "tipping elements" in the human gut microbiota.</p></details> |  |
| **[Information-theoretic limits and approximate message-passing for high-dimensional time series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13625v1)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-dimensional time series appear in many scientific setups, demanding a nuanced approach to model and analyze the underlying dependence structure. However, theoretical advancements so far often rely on stringent assumptions regarding the sparsity of the underlying signals. In this contribution, we expand the scope by investigating a high-dimensional time series model wherein the number of features grows proportionally to the number of sampling points, without assuming sparsity in the signal. Specifically, we consider the stochastic regression model and derive a single-letter formula for the normalized mutual information between observations and the signal. We also empirically study the vector approximate message passing (VAMP) algorithm and show that, despite a lack of theoretical guarantees, its performance for inference in our time series model is robust and often statistically optimal.</p></details> |  |
| **[Determining The Number of Factors in Two-Way Factor Model of High-Dimensional Matrix-Variate Time Series: A White-Noise based Method for Serial Correlation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13614v1)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we study a new two-way factor model for high-dimensional matrix-variate time series. To estimate the number of factors in this two-way factor model, we decompose the series into two parts: one being a non-weakly correlated series and the other being a weakly correlated noise. By comparing the difference between two series, we can construct white-noise based signal statistics to determine the number of factors in row loading matrix (column loading matrix). Furthermore, to mitigate the negative impact on the accuracy of the estimation, which is caused by the interaction between the row loading matrix and the column loading matrix, we propose a transformation so that the transformed model only contains the row loading matrix (column loading matrix). We define sequences of ratios of two test statistics as signal statistics to determine the number of factors and derive the consistence of the estimation. We implement the numerical studies to examine the performance of the new methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Contrastive Representation Learning Helps Cross-institutional Knowledge Transfer: A Study in Pediatric Ventilation Management](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13587v1)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Clinical machine learning deployment across institutions faces significant challenges when patient populations and clinical practices differ substantially. We present a systematic framework for cross-institutional knowledge transfer in clinical time series, demonstrated through pediatric ventilation management between a general pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) and a cardiac-focused unit. Using contrastive predictive coding (CPC) for representation learning, we investigate how different data regimes and fine-tuning strategies affect knowledge transfer across institutional boundaries. Our results show that while direct model transfer performs poorly, CPC with appropriate fine-tuning enables effective knowledge sharing between institutions, with benefits particularly evident in limited data scenarios. Analysis of transfer patterns reveals an important asymmetry: temporal progression patterns transfer more readily than point-of-care decisions, suggesting practical pathways for cross-institutional deployment. Through a systematic evaluation of fine-tuning approaches and transfer patterns, our work provides insights for developing more generalizable clinical decision support systems while enabling smaller specialized units to leverage knowledge from larger centers.</p></details> |  |
| **[GCAD: Anomaly Detection in Multivariate Time Series from the Perspective of Granger Causality](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13493v1)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multivariate time series anomaly detection has numerous real-world applications and is being extensively studied. Modeling pairwise correlations between variables is crucial. Existing methods employ learnable graph structures and graph neural networks to explicitly model the spatial dependencies between variables. However, these methods are primarily based on prediction or reconstruction tasks, which can only learn similarity relationships between sequence embeddings and lack interpretability in how graph structures affect time series evolution. In this paper, we designed a framework that models spatial dependencies using interpretable causal relationships and detects anomalies through changes in causal patterns. Specifically, we propose a method to dynamically discover Granger causality using gradients in nonlinear deep predictors and employ a simple sparsification strategy to obtain a Granger causality graph, detecting anomalies from a causal perspective. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed model achieves more accurate anomaly detection compared to baseline methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AAAI 2025</p></details> |
| **[FreEformer: Frequency Enhanced Transformer for Multivariate Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13989v1)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents \textbf{FreEformer}, a simple yet effective model that leverages a \textbf{Fre}quency \textbf{E}nhanced Trans\textbf{former} for multivariate time series forecasting. Our work is based on the assumption that the frequency spectrum provides a global perspective on the composition of series across various frequencies and is highly suitable for robust representation learning. Specifically, we first convert time series into the complex frequency domain using the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT). The Transformer architecture is then applied to the frequency spectra to capture cross-variate dependencies, with the real and imaginary parts processed independently. However, we observe that the vanilla attention matrix exhibits a low-rank characteristic, thus limiting representation diversity. This could be attributed to the inherent sparsity of the frequency domain and the strong-value-focused nature of Softmax in vanilla attention. To address this, we enhance the vanilla attention mechanism by introducing an additional learnable matrix to the original attention matrix, followed by row-wise L1 normalization. Theoretical analysis~demonstrates that this enhanced attention mechanism improves both feature diversity and gradient flow. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FreEformer consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models on eighteen real-world benchmarks covering electricity, traffic, weather, healthcare and finance. Notably, the enhanced attention mechanism also consistently improves the performance of state-of-the-art Transformer-based forecasters.</p></details> |  |

Therefore, it stands to benefit from the application of machine learning algorithms. While many algorithms have been proposed for this purpose, certain critical architectural decisions have not received systematic exploration. In this study, we meticulously investigate these design choices within the broad category of encoder-predictor architectures. We identify robust architectures applicable to both time series and spectrogram input representations. These architectures incorporate structured state space models as integral components and achieve statistically significant performance improvements compared to state-of-the-art approaches on the extensive Sleep Heart Health Study dataset. We anticipate that the architectural insights gained from this study along with the refined methodology for architecture search demonstrated herein will not only prove valuable for future research in sleep staging but also hold relevance for other time series annotation tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>versi...</summary><p>version accepted by Computers in Biology and Medicine, code available at https://github.com/AI4HealthUOL/s4sleep</p></details> |
| **[RelCon: Relative Contrastive Learning for a Motion Foundation Model for Wearable Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18822v4)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present RelCon, a novel self-supervised *Rel*ative *Con*trastive learning approach that uses a learnable distance measure in combination with a softened contrastive loss for training an motion foundation model from wearable sensors. The learnable distance measure captures motif similarity and domain-specific semantic information such as rotation invariance. The learned distance provides a measurement of semantic similarity between a pair of accelerometer time-series segments, which is used to measure the distance between an anchor and various other sampled candidate segments. The self-supervised model is trained on 1 billion segments from 87,376 participants from a large wearables dataset. The model achieves strong performance across multiple downstream tasks, encompassing both classification and regression. To our knowledge, we are the first to show the generalizability of a self-supervised learning model with motion data from wearables across distinct evaluation tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR 2025</p></details> |
| **[Numerically Robust Fixed-Point Smoothing Without State Augmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20004v2)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Practical implementations of Gaussian smoothing algorithms have received a great deal of attention in the last 60 years. However, almost all work focuses on estimating complete time series (''fixed-interval smoothing'', $\mathcal{O}(K)$ memory) through variations of the Rauch--Tung--Striebel smoother, rarely on estimating the initial states (''fixed-point smoothing'', $\mathcal{O}(1)$ memory). Since fixed-point smoothing is a crucial component of algorithms for dynamical systems with unknown initial conditions, we close this gap by introducing a new formulation of a Gaussian fixed-point smoother. In contrast to prior approaches, our perspective admits a numerically robust Cholesky-based form (without downdates) and avoids state augmentation, which would needlessly inflate the state-space model and reduce the numerical practicality of any fixed-point smoother code. The experiments demonstrate how a JAX implementation of our algorithm matches the runtime of the fastest methods and the robustness of the most robust techniques while existing implementations must always sacrifice one for the other.</p></details> |  |
| **[Time Series Embedding Methods for Classification Tasks: A Review](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13392v1)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series analysis has become crucial in various fields, from engineering and finance to healthcare and social sciences. In this paper, we present a comprehensive review and evaluation of time series embedding methods for effective representations in machine learning and deep learning models. We introduce a taxonomy of embedding techniques, categorizing them based on their theoretical foundations and application contexts. Unlike previous surveys, our work provides a quantitative evaluation of representative methods from each category by assessing their performance on downstream classification tasks across diverse real-world datasets. Our experimental results demonstrate that the performance of embedding methods varies significantly depending on the dataset and classification algorithm used, highlighting the importance of careful model selection and extensive experimentation for specific applications, including engineering systems. To facilitate further research and practical applications, we provide an open-source code repository implementing these embedding methods. This study contributes to the field by offering a systematic comparison of time series embedding techniques, guiding practitioners in selecting appropriate methods for their specific applications, and providing a foundation for future advancements in time series analysis.</p></details> |  |
| **[Synergizing Large Language Models and Task-specific Models for Time Series Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05675v3)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In anomaly detection, methods based on large language models (LLMs) can incorporate expert knowledge by reading professional document, while task-specific small models excel at extracting normal data patterns and detecting value fluctuations from training data of target applications. Inspired by the human nervous system, where the brain stores expert knowledge and the peripheral nervous system and spinal cord handle specific tasks like withdrawal and knee-jerk reflexes, we propose CoLLaTe, a framework designed to facilitate collaboration between LLMs and task-specific models, leveraging the strengths of both models for anomaly detection. In particular, we first formulate the collaboration process and identify two key challenges in the collaboration: (1) the misalignment between the expression domains of the LLMs and task-specific small models, and (2) error accumulation arising from the predictions of both models. To address these challenges, we then introduce two key components in CoLLaTe: a model alignment module and a collaborative loss function. Through theoretical analysis and experimental validation, we demonstrate that these components effectively mitigate the identified challenges and achieve better performance than both LLM-based and task-specific models.</p></details> |  |
| **[T-Graphormer: Using Transformers for Spatiotemporal Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13274v1)** | 2025-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series data is ubiquitous and appears in all fields of study. In multivariate time series, observations are interconnected both temporally and across components. For instance, in traffic flow analysis, traffic speeds at different intersections exhibit complex spatiotemporal correlations. Modelling this dual structure poses significant challenges. Most existing forecasting methods tackle these challenges by separately learning spatial and temporal dependencies. In this work, we introduce T-Graphormer, a Transformer-based approach designed to model spatiotemporal correlations directly. Extending the Graphormer architecture to incorporate temporal dynamics, our method updates each node representation by selectively attending to all other nodes within a graph sequence. This design enables the model to capture rich spatiotemporal patterns with minimal reliance on predefined spacetime inductive biases. We validate the effectiveness of T-Graphormer on real-world traffic prediction benchmark datasets, achieving up to 10% reductions in both root mean squared error (RMSE) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) compared to state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Dynamic Triple Gamma Prior as a Shrinkage Process Prior for Time-Varying Parameter Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10487v2)** | 2025-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many existing shrinkage approaches for time-varying parameter (TVP) models assume constant innovation variances across time points, inducing sparsity by shrinking these variances toward zero. However, this assumption falls short when states exhibit large jumps or structural changes, as often seen in empirical time series analysis. To address this, we propose the dynamic triple gamma prior -- a stochastic process that induces time-dependent shrinkage by modeling dependence among innovations while retaining a well-known triple gamma marginal distribution. This framework encompasses various special and limiting cases, including the horseshoe shrinkage prior, making it highly flexible. We derive key properties of the dynamic triple gamma that highlight its dynamic shrinkage behavior and develop an efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm for posterior sampling. The proposed approach is evaluated through sparse covariance modeling and forecasting of the returns of the EURO STOXX 50 index, demonstrating favorable forecasting performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multiple change point detection based on Hodrick-Prescott and $l_1$ filtering method for random walk time series data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11805v2)** | 2025-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose new methods for detecting multiple change points in time series, specifically designed for random walk processes, where stationarity and variance changes present challenges. Our approach combines two trend estimation methods: the Hodrick Prescott (HP) filter and the l1 filter. A major challenge in these methods is selecting the tuning parameter lambda, which we address by introducing two selection techniques. For the HP based change point detection, we propose a probability-based threshold to select lambda under the assumption of an exponential distribution. For the l1 based method, we suggest a selection strategy assuming normality. Additionally, we introduce a technique to estimate the maximum number of change points in time segments using the l1 based method. We validate our methods by comparing them to similar techniques, such as PELT, using simulated data. We also demonstrate the practical application of our approach to real-world SNP stock data, showcasing its effectiveness in detecting change points.</p></details> |  |
| **[Real-Time Multi-Modal Subcomponent-Level Measurements for Trustworthy System Monitoring and Malware Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13081v1)** | 2025-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With increasingly sophisticated cyber-adversaries able to access a wider repertoire of mechanisms to implant malware such as ransomware, CPU/GPU keyloggers, and stealthy kernel rootkits, there is an urgent need for techniques to detect and mitigate such attacks. While state of the art relies on digital and analog side channel measurements assuming trustworthiness of measurements obtained on the main processor, such an approach has limitations since processor-based side channel measurements are potentially untrustworthy. Sophisticated adversaries (especially in late stage cyber attacks when they have breached the computer and network security systems such as firewalls and antivirus and penetrated the computer's OS) can compromise user-space and kernel-space measurements. To address this key limitation of state of the art, we propose a "subcomponent-level" approach to collect side channel measurements so as to enable robust anomaly detection in a modern computer even when the main processor is compromised. Our proposed approach leverages the fact that modern computers are complex systems with multiple interacting subcomponents and measurements from subcomponents can be used to detect anomalies even when the main processor is no longer trustworthy. We develop mechanisms to obtain time series measurements of activity of several subcomponents and methodologies to process and fuse these measurements for anomaly detection. The subcomponents include network interface controller, GPU, CPU Hardware Performance Counters, CPU power, and keyboard. Our main hypothesis is that subcomponent measurements can enable detection of security threats without requiring a trustworthy main processor. By enabling real-time measurements from multiple subcomponents, the goal is to provide a deeper visibility into system operation, thereby yielding a powerful tool to track system operation and detect anomalies.</p></details> | 12 pages, 29 figures |

The process begins with a denoising autoencoder to filter out random noise fluctuations from the main contract price data. Then, one-dimensional convolution reduces the dimensionality of the filtered data and extracts key information. The filtered and dimensionality-reduced price data is fed into a GANs network, and its output serve as input of a fully connected network. Through cross-validation, a model is trained to capture features that precede large price fluctuations. The model predicts the likelihood and direction of significant price changes in real-time price sequences, placing trades at moments of high prediction accuracy. Empirical results demonstrate that using autoencoders and convolution to filter and denoise financial data, combined with GANs, achieves a certain level of predictive performance, validating the capabilities of machine learning algorithms to discover underlying patterns in financial sequences.

| **[TimeFilter: Patch-Specific Spatial-Temporal Graph Filtration for Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13041v1)** | 2025-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current time series forecasting methods can be broadly classified into two categories: Channel Independent (CI) and Channel Dependent (CD) strategies, both aiming to capture the complex dependencies within time series data. However, the CI strategy fails to exploit highly correlated covariate information, while the CD strategy integrates all dependencies, including irrelevant or noisy ones, thus compromising generalization. To mitigate these issues, recent works have introduced the Channel Clustering (CC) strategy by grouping channels with similar characteristics and applying different modeling techniques to each cluster. However, coarse-grained clustering cannot flexibly capture complex, time-varying interactions. Addressing the above challenges, we propose TimeFilter, a graph-based framework for adaptive and fine-grained dependency modeling. Specifically, after constructing the graph with the input sequence, TimeFilter filters out irrelevant correlations and preserves the most critical ones through patch-specific filtering.

| **[Causality for VARMA processes with instantaneous effects: The global Markov property, faithfulness and instrumental variables](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13037v1)** | 2025-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Causal reasoning has gained great attention over the last half century as it allows (or at least intends) to answer questions which go above those within the capabilities of classical inferential statistics using just observational data. So far, causal research has been focused mostly on the i.i.d. setting. However, many are the situations where there exists a non-trivial dependence structure between sequential observations. Motivated by this fact, the main purpose of this work is to study causal properties of time series under the structural assumption of a VARMA model with instantaneous effects. First, the global Markov property is studied, building on existing work for VAR processes without instantaneous effects. Infinite graphs which represent the dependencies of the process are defined so that separation statements translate to conditional independencies in the stationary distribution of the process. Second, faithfulness is examined as a counterpart of this Markov property. Conditions are given so that the stationary distribution of the process is almost surely faithful to said infinite graphs. In addition, an instrumental variable regression framework is developed for VARMA models with instantaneous effects. This allows to identify and consistently estimate total causal effects.</p></details> | 42 pages, 9 figures |

Punctuation marks at the end of sentences are of particular importance as their distribution can determine various complexity features of written natural language. Here, the sentence length variability (SLV) time series representing "Hopscotch" by Julio Cortazar are subjected to quantitative analysis with an attempt to identify their distribution type, long-memory effects, and potential multiscale patterns. The analyzed novel is an important and innovative piece of literature whose essential property is freedom of movement between its building blocks given to a reader by the author. The statistical consequences of this freedom are closely investigated in both the original, Spanish version of the novel, and its translations into English and Polish. Clear evidence of rich multifractality in the SLV dynamics, with a left-sided asymmetry, however, is observed in all three language versions as well as in the versions with differently ordered chapters.</p></details> |  |
| **[Budget-constrained Collaborative Renewable Energy Forecasting Market](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12367v2)** | 2025-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate power forecasting from renewable energy sources (RES) is crucial for integrating additional RES capacity into the power system and realizing sustainability goals. This work emphasizes the importance of integrating decentralized spatio-temporal data into forecasting models. However, decentralized data ownership presents a critical obstacle to the success of such spatio-temporal models, and incentive mechanisms to foster data-sharing need to be considered. The main contributions are a) a comparative analysis of the forecasting models, advocating for efficient and interpretable spline LASSO regression models, and b) a bidding mechanism within the data/analytics market to ensure fair compensation for data providers and enable both buyers and sellers to express their data price requirements. Furthermore, an incentive mechanism for time series forecasting is proposed, effectively incorporating price constraints and preventing redundant feature allocation. Results show significant accuracy improvements and potential monetary gains for data sellers. For wind power data, an average root mean squared error improvement of over 10% was achieved by comparing forecasts generated by the proposal with locally generated ones.</p></details> |  |

The complex interactions between neoplastic cells and normal tissue, as well as the treatment-induced changes often encountered, make glioma tumor growth modeling challenging. In this paper, we present a novel end-to-end network capable of future predictions of tumor masks and multi-parametric magnetic resonance images (MRI) of how the tumor will look at any future time points for different treatment plans. Our approach is based on cutting-edge diffusion probabilistic models and deep-segmentation neural networks. We included sequential multi-parametric MRI and treatment information as conditioning inputs to guide the generative diffusion process as well as a joint segmentation process. This allows for tumor growth estimates and realistic MRI generation at any given treatment and time point. We trained the model using real-world postoperative longitudinal MRI data with glioma tumor growth trajectories represented as tumor segmentation maps over time. The model demonstrates promising performance across various tasks, including generating high-quality multi-parametric MRI with tumor masks, performing time-series tumor segmentations, and providing uncertainty estimates. Combined with the treatment-aware generated MRI, the tumor growth predictions with uncertainty estimates can provide useful information for clinical decision-making.</p></details> | <details><summary>prepr...</summary><p>preprints in IEEE-TMI, 14 pages</p></details> |

With the rise of Quantum Machine Learning (QML), it has emerged a new paradigm possessing the potential to enhance predictive capabilities beyond what classical machine learning models can achieve. In the present work we pursue a heuristic approach to explore the potential of QML, and focus on a specific transport issue. In particular, as a case study we investigate a traffic forecast task for a major urban area in Athens (Greece), for which we possess high-resolution data. In this endeavor we explore the application of Quantum Neural Networks (QNN), and, notably, we present the first application of quantum data re-uploading in the context of transport forecasting. This technique allows quantum models to better capture complex patterns, such as traffic dynamics, by repeatedly encoding classical data into a quantum state. Aside from providing a prediction model, we spend considerable effort in comparing the performance of our hybrid quantum-classical neural networks with classical deep learning approaches. Our results show that hybrid models achieve competitive accuracy with state-of-the-art classical methods, especially when the number of qubits and re-uploading blocks is increased. While the classical models demonstrate lower computational demands, we provide evidence that increasing the complexity of the quantum model improves predictive accuracy. These findings indicate that QML techniques, and specifically the data re-uploading approach, hold promise for advancing traffic forecasting models and could be instrumental in addressing challenges inherent in ITS environments.</p></details> |  |

Here, we proposed a general and analytical ultralow-dimensionality reduction method for dynamical systems named spatial-temporal principal component analysis (stPCA) to fully represent the dynamics of a high-dimensional time-series by only a single latent variable without distortion, which transforms high-dimensional spatial information into one-dimensional temporal information based on nonlinear delay-embedding theory. The dynamics of this single variable is analytically solved and theoretically preserves the temporal property of original high-dimensional time-series, thereby accurately and reliably identifying the tipping point before an upcoming critical transition. Its applications to real-world datasets such as individual-specific heterogeneous ICU records demonstrated the effectiveness of stPCA, which quantitatively and robustly provides the early-warning signals of the critical/tipping state on each patient.</p></details> |  |
| **[Two-way Matrix Autoregressive Model with Thresholds](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10272v2)** | 2025-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, matrix-valued time series data have attracted significant attention in the literature with the recognition of threshold nonlinearity representing a significant advance. However, given the fact that a matrix is a two-array structure, it is unfortunate, perhaps even unusual, for the threshold literature to focus on using the same threshold variable for the rows and the columns. In fact, evidence in economic, financial, environmental and other data shows advantages of allowing the possibilities of two different threshold variables (with possibly different threshold parameters for rows and columns), hence the need for a Two-way Matrix AutoRegressive model with Thresholds (2-MART). Naturally, two threshold variables pose new and perhaps even fierce challenges, which might be the reason behind the adoption of only one threshold variable in the literature up to now. In this paper, we develop a comprehensive methodology for the 2-MART model, by overcoming various challenges. Compared with existing models in the literature, the new model can achieve greater dimension reduction, much better model fitting, more accurate predictions, and more plausible interpretations.</p></details> |  |

The core research problem is developing an effective computer vision-based model using raw candlestick visuals without time-series data. We specifically analyze the impact of incorporating candlestick patterns that were detected by YOLOv8. The study implements two approaches: pure CNN on chart images and a Decomposer architecture detecting patterns. Experiments utilize diverse financial datasets spanning stocks, cryptocurrencies, and forex assets. Key findings demonstrate candlestick patterns do not improve model performance over only image data in our research. The significance is illuminating limitations in candlestick image signals. Performance peaked at approximately 0.7 accuracy, below more complex time-series models. Outcomes reveal challenges in distilling sufficient predictive power from visual shapes alone, motivating the incorporation of other data modalities. This research clarifies how purely image-based models can inform trading while confirming patterns add little value over raw charts. Our content is endeavored to be delineated into distinct sections, each autonomously furnishing a unique contribution while maintaining cohesive linkage. Note that, the examples discussed herein are not limited to the scope, applicability, or knowledge outlined in the paper.</p></details> | ACMLC 2025; 8 pages |
| **[Automatic selection of the best neural architecture for time series forecasting via multi-objective optimization and Pareto optimality conditions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12215v1)** | 2025-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting plays a pivotal role in a wide range of applications, including weather prediction, healthcare, structural health monitoring, predictive maintenance, energy systems, and financial markets. While models such as LSTM, GRU, Transformers, and State-Space Models (SSMs) have become standard tools in this domain, selecting the optimal architecture remains a challenge. Performance comparisons often depend on evaluation metrics and the datasets under analysis, making the choice of a universally optimal model controversial. In this work, we introduce a flexible automated framework for time series forecasting that systematically designs and evaluates diverse network architectures by integrating LSTM, GRU, multi-head Attention, and SSM blocks. Using a multi-objective optimization approach, our framework determines the number, sequence, and combination of blocks to align with specific requirements and evaluation objectives. From the resulting Pareto-optimal architectures, the best model for a given context is selected via a user-defined preference function. We validate our framework across four distinct real-world applications. Results show that a single-layer GRU or LSTM is usually optimal when minimizing training time alone. However, when maximizing accuracy or balancing multiple objectives, the best architectures are often composite designs incorporating multiple block types in specific configurations. By employing a weighted preference function, users can resolve trade-offs between objectives, revealing novel, context-specific optimal architectures. Our findings underscore that no single neural architecture is universally optimal for time series forecasting. Instead, the best-performing model emerges as a data-driven composite architecture tailored to user-defined criteria and evaluation objectives.</p></details> | 35 pages, 8 figures |

Foundation models, pre-trained on diverse datasets, can be applied in a zero-shot setting with minimal data or further improved through finetuning. We compare Google's TimesFM model to conventional parametric and non-parametric models, including GARCH and Generalized Autoregressive Score (GAS), using 19 years of daily returns from the S&P 100 index and its constituents. Backtesting with over 8.5 years of out-of-sample data shows that the fine-tuned foundation model consistently outperforms traditional methods in actual-over-expected ratios. For the quantile score loss function, it performs comparably to the best econometric model, GAS. Overall, the foundation model ranks as the best or among the top performers across the 0.01, 0.025, 0.05, and 0.1 quantile forecasting. Fine-tuning significantly improves accuracy, showing that zero-shot use is not optimal for VaR.</p></details> |  |
| **[Heterogeneous Federated Learning Systems for Time-Series Power Consumption Prediction with Multi-Head Embedding Mechanism](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12136v1)** | 2025-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time-series prediction is increasingly popular in a variety of applications, such as smart factories and smart transportation. Researchers have used various techniques to predict power consumption, but existing models lack discussion of collaborative learning and privacy issues among multiple clients. To address these issues, we propose Multi-Head Heterogeneous Federated Learning (MHHFL) systems that consist of multiple head networks, which independently act as carriers for federated learning. In the federated period, each head network is embedded into 2-dimensional vectors and shared with the centralized source pool. MHHFL then selects appropriate source networks and blends the head networks as knowledge transfer in federated learning. The experimental results show that the proposed MHHFL systems significantly outperform the benchmark and state-of-the-art systems and reduce the prediction error by 24.9% to 94.1%. The ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed mechanisms in the MHHFL (head network embedding and selection mechanisms), which significantly outperforms traditional federated average and random transfer.</p></details> |  |
| **[Heterogeneous Federated Learning System for Sparse Healthcare Time-Series Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12125v1)** | 2025-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we propose a heterogeneous federated learning (HFL) system for sparse time series prediction in healthcare, which is a decentralized federated learning algorithm with heterogeneous transfers. We design dense and sparse feature tensors to deal with the sparsity of data sources. Heterogeneous federated learning is developed to share asynchronous parts of networks and select appropriate models for knowledge transfer. Experimental results show that the proposed HFL achieves the lowest prediction error among all benchmark systems on eight out of ten prediction tasks, with MSE reduction of 94.8%, 48.3%, and 52.1% compared to the benchmark systems. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of HFL in transferring knowledge from heterogeneous domains, especially in the smaller target domain. Ablation studies then demonstrate the effectiveness of the designed mechanisms for heterogeneous domain selection and switching in predicting healthcare time series with privacy, model security, and heterogeneous knowledge transfer.</p></details> |  |
| **[Noise-Resilient Point-wise Anomaly Detection in Time Series Using Weak Segment Labels](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11959v1)** | 2025-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Detecting anomalies in temporal data has gained significant attention across various real-world applications, aiming to identify unusual events and mitigate potential hazards. In practice, situations often involve a mix of segment-level labels (detected abnormal events with segments of time points) and unlabeled data (undetected events), while the ideal algorithmic outcome should be point-level predictions. Therefore, the huge label information gap between training data and targets makes the task challenging. In this study, we formulate the above imperfect information as noisy labels and propose NRdetector, a noise-resilient framework that incorporates confidence-based sample selection, robust segment-level learning, and data-centric point-level detection for multivariate time series anomaly detection. Particularly, to bridge the information gap between noisy segment-level labels and missing point-level labels, we develop a novel loss function that can effectively mitigate the label noise and consider the temporal features. It encourages the smoothness of consecutive points and the separability of points from segments with different labels. Extensive experiments on real-world multivariate time series datasets with 11 different evaluation metrics demonstrate that NRdetector consistently achieves robust results across multiple real-world datasets, outperforming various baselines adapted to operate in our setting.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by 2025 ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (KDD'25)</p></details> |

To achieve this, new evaluation metrics are proposed, offering a comprehensive assessment of interval prediction methods across both all-sample and single-sample scenarios. Additionally, a novel Pattern-Diversity Conditional Time-Series Generative Adversarial Network (PDCTSGAN) is developed, designed to generate realistic scenarios and support a new interval prediction framework based on scenario generation. The PDCTSGAN model incorporates unique modifications to random noise inputs, enabling the creation of pattern-diverse and realistic scenarios. These scenarios are then utilized to produce multiple interval patterns characterized by high coverage probability and reduced average width. The proposed approach is validated through detailed case studies, and the paper concludes with a discussion of future research directions to further refine interval prediction techniques.</p></details> |  |
| **[Transformer Vibration Forecasting for Advancing Rail Safety and Maintenance 4.0](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11730v1)** | 2025-01-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Maintaining railway axles is critical to preventing severe accidents and financial losses. The railway industry is increasingly interested in advanced condition monitoring techniques to enhance safety and efficiency, moving beyond traditional periodic inspections toward Maintenance 4.0. This study introduces a robust Deep Autoregressive solution that integrates seamlessly with existing systems to avert mechanical failures. Our approach simulates and predicts vibration signals under various conditions and fault scenarios, improving dataset robustness for more effective detection systems. These systems can alert maintenance needs, preventing accidents preemptively. We use experimental vibration signals from accelerometers on train axles. Our primary contributions include a transformer model, ShaftFormer, designed for processing time series data, and an alternative model incorporating spectral methods and enhanced observation models. Simulating vibration signals under diverse conditions mitigates the high cost of obtaining experimental signals for all scenarios. Given the non-stationary nature of railway vibration signals, influenced by speed and load changes, our models address these complexities, offering a powerful tool for predictive maintenance in the rail industry.</p></details> |  |
| **[Investigating the performance of the Phase II Hotelling T2 chart when monitoring multivariate time series observations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11649v1)** | 2025-01-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Thanks to high-tech measurement systems like sensors, data are often collected with high frequency in modern industrial processes. This phenomenon could potentially produce autocorrelated and cross-correlated measurements. It has been shown that if this issue is not properly accounted for while designing the control charts, many false alarms may be observed, disrupting the monitoring process efficiency. There are generally two recommended ways to monitor autocorrelated data: fitting a time series model and then monitoring the residuals or directly monitoring the original observations. Although residual charts are popular in the literature because they offer advantages such as ease of implementation, questions have been raised about their efficiency due to the loss of information. This paper develops the methodology for applying Hotelling's T2 chart directly to monitoring multivariate autocorrelated and cross-correlated observations. To model such data, we use the multivariate vector autoregressive time series model of order p >= 1, denoted as VAR(p). We compare the performance of the T2 chart based on the original observations and the residual-based T2 chart using the well-known metric average run length and a newly introduced criterion called first-to-signal. The results indicate that the proposed method consistently outperforms the alternative chart. We also illustrate the proposed method using two examples: one from a steel sheet rolling process (VAR(1) observations) and another from a chemical process (VAR(3) observations).</p></details> |  |
| **[Ergodic Network Stochastic Differential Equations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17779v2)** | 2025-01-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a novel framework for Network Stochastic Differential Equations (N-SDE), where each node in a network is governed by an SDE influenced by interactions with its neighbors. The evolution of each node is driven by the interplay of three key components: the node's intrinsic dynamics (\emph{momentum effect}), feedback from neighboring nodes (\emph{network effect}), and a \emph{stochastic volatility} term modeled by Brownian motion. Our primary objective is to estimate the parameters of the N-SDE system from high-frequency discrete-time observations. The motivation behind this model lies in its ability to analyze very high-dimensional time series by leveraging the inherent sparsity of the underlying network graph. We consider two distinct scenarios: \textit{i) known network structure}: the graph is fully specified, and we establish conditions under which the parameters can be identified, considering the linear growth of the parameter space with the number of edges. \textit{ii) unknown network structure}: the graph must be inferred from the data. For this, we develop an iterative procedure using adaptive Lasso, tailored to a specific subclass of N-SDE models. In this work, we assume the network graph is oriented, paving the way for novel applications of SDEs in causal inference, enabling the study of cause-effect relationships in dynamic systems. Through extensive simulation studies, we demonstrate the performance of our estimators across various graph topologies in high-dimensional settings. We also showcase the framework's applicability to real-world datasets, highlighting its potential for advancing the analysis of complex networked systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Using dynamic loss weighting to boost improvements in forecast stability](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18267v2)** | 2025-01-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Rolling origin forecast instability refers to variability in forecasts for a specific period induced by updating the forecast when new data points become available. Recently, an extension to the N-BEATS model for univariate time series point forecasting was proposed to include forecast stability as an additional optimization objective, next to accuracy. It was shown that more stable forecasts can be obtained without harming accuracy by minimizing a composite loss function that contains both a forecast error and a forecast instability component, with a static hyperparameter to control the impact of stability. In this paper, we empirically investigate whether further improvements in stability can be obtained without compromising accuracy by applying dynamic loss weighting algorithms, which change the loss weights during training. We show that existing dynamic loss weighting methods can achieve this objective and provide insights into why this might be the case. Additionally, we propose an extension to the Random Weighting approach -- Task-Aware Random Weighting -- which also achieves this objective.</p></details> |  |

However, predicting RUL is challenging due to the nonlinear characteristics of the degradation caused by complex chemical reactions. Machine learning allows precise predictions by learning the latent functions of degradation relationships based on cycling behavior. This study introduces an accurate RUL prediction approach based on feature engineering and DLinear, applied to the dataset from NASA's Prognostics Center of Excellence. Among the 20 features generated from current, voltage, temperature, and time provided in this dataset, key features contributing to degradation are selected using Pearson correlation coefficient and Shapley values. Shapley value-based feature selection effectively reflects cell-to-cell variability, showing similar importance rankings across all cells. The DLinear-based RUL prediction using key features efficiently captures the time-series trend, demonstrating significantly better performance compared to Long Short-Term Memory and Transformer models.</p></details> |  |

The obtained results, for 5 different datasets, show that the new representation, computed using the tsfresh library, allows Isolation Forest to significantly improve its performance.</p></details> | 7 |
| **[A Gaussian Sliding Windows Regression Model for Hydrological Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00453v4)** | 2025-01-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Statistical models are an essential tool to model, forecast and understand the hydrological processes in watersheds. In particular, the understanding of time lags associated with the delay between rainfall occurrence and subsequent changes in streamflow is of high practical importance. Since water can take a variety of flow paths to generate streamflow, a series of distinct runoff pulses may combine to create the observed streamflow time series. Current state-of-the-art models are not able to sufficiently confront the problem complexity with interpretable parametrization, thus preventing novel insights about the dynamics of distinct flow paths from being formed. The proposed Gaussian Sliding Windows Regression Model targets this problem by combining the concept of multiple windows sliding along the time axis with multiple linear regression. The window kernels, which indicate the weights applied to different time lags, are implemented via Gaussian-shaped kernels. As a result, straightforward process inference can be achieved since each window can represent one flow path. Experiments on simulated and real-world scenarios underline that the proposed model achieves accurate parameter estimates and competitive predictive performance, while fostering explainable and interpretable hydrological modeling.</p></details> |  |
| **[An accuracy-runtime trade-off comparison of scalable Gaussian process approximations for spatial data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11448v1)** | 2025-01-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Gaussian processes (GPs) are flexible, probabilistic, non-parametric models widely employed in various fields such as spatial statistics, time series analysis, and machine learning. A drawback of Gaussian processes is their computational cost having $\mathcal{O}(N^3)$ time and $\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ memory complexity which makes them prohibitive for large datasets. Numerous approximation techniques have been proposed to address this limitation. In this work, we systematically compare the accuracy of different Gaussian process approximations concerning marginal likelihood evaluation, parameter estimation, and prediction taking into account the time required to achieve a certain accuracy. We analyze this trade-off between accuracy and runtime on multiple simulated and large-scale real-world datasets and find that Vecchia approximations consistently emerge as the most accurate in almost all experiments. However, for certain real-world data sets, low-rank inducing point-based methods, i.e., full-scale and modified predictive process approximations, can provide more accurate predictive distributions for extrapolation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Algorithm Selection with Probing Trajectories: Benchmarking the Choice of Classifier Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11414v1)** | 2025-01-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent approaches to training algorithm selectors in the black-box optimisation domain have advocated for the use of training data that is algorithm-centric in order to encapsulate information about how an algorithm performs on an instance, rather than relying on information derived from features of the instance itself. Probing-trajectories that consist of a sequence of objective performance per function evaluation obtained from a short run of an algorithm have recently shown particular promise in training accurate selectors. However, training models on this type of data requires an appropriately chosen classifier given the sequential nature of the data. There are currently no clear guidelines for choosing the most appropriate classifier for algorithm selection using time-series data from the plethora of models available. To address this, we conduct a large benchmark study using 17 different classifiers and three types of trajectory on a classification task using the BBOB benchmark suite using both leave-one-instance out and leave-one-problem out cross-validation. In contrast to previous studies using tabular data, we find that the choice of classifier has a significant impact, showing that feature-based and interval-based models are the best choices.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in Applications of Evolutionary Computation 28th International Conference, EvoApplications 2025</p></details> |

In this study, we focus on input reconstruction (IR), which refers to training the readout layer to reproduce the input time series in its output. We reformulate the learning algorithm of the ESN readout layer to perform IR using unsupervised learning (UL). By conducting theoretical analysis and numerical experiments, we demonstrate that IR in ESNs can be effectively implemented under realistic conditions without explicitly using the desired outputs as training data; in this way, UL is enabled. Furthermore, we demonstrate that applications relying on IR, such as dynamical system replication and noise filtering, can be reformulated within the UL framework. Our findings establish a theoretically sound and universally applicable IR formulation, along with its related tasks in ESNs. This work paves the way for novel predictions and highlights unresolved theoretical challenges in ESNs, particularly in the context of time-series processing methods and computational models of the brain.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 7 figures, regular paper</p></details> |

Recently, it has been conjectured that reservoir computers, a particular class of RNNs, trained on observations of a dynamical systems can be interpreted as embeddings. This result has been established for the case of linear reservoir systems. In this work, we use a nonautonomous dynamical systems approach to establish an upper bound for the fractal dimension of the subset of reservoir state space approximated during training and prediction phase. We prove that when the input sequences comes from an Nin-dimensional invertible dynamical system, the fractal dimension of this set is bounded above by Nin. The result obtained here are useful in dimensionality reduction of computation in RNNs as well as estimating fractal dimensions of dynamical systems from limited observations of their time series. It is also a step towards understanding embedding properties of reservoir computers.</p></details> |  |

These techniques suffer from parameter updating in real-time use cases, especially when the system parameters are likely to change during or between processes. Recently, the OASIS [Bhadriraju et al. 2020] framework introduced a data-driven technique to address the limitations of real-time dynamical system parameters updating, yielding interesting results. Nevertheless, we show in this work that superior performance can be achieved using more advanced model architectures. We present an innovative encoding approach, based mainly on the use of Set Encoding methods of sequence data, which give accurate adaptive model identification for complex dynamic systems, with variable input time series length. Two Set Encoding methods are used, the first is Deep Set [Zaheer et al. 2017], and the second is Set Transformer [Lee et al. 2019]. Comparing Set Transformer to OASIS framework on Lotka Volterra for real-time local dynamical system identification and time series forecasting, we find that the Set Transformer architecture is well adapted to learning relationships within data sets. We then compare the two Set Encoding methods based on the Lorenz system for online global dynamical system identification. Finally, we trained a Deep Set model to perform identification and characterization of abnormalities for 1D heat-transfer problem.</p></details> |  |
| **[High-dimensional point forecast combinations for emergency department demand](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11315v1)** | 2025-01-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current work on forecasting emergency department (ED) admissions focuses on disease aggregates or singular disease types. However, given differences in the dynamics of individual diseases, it is unlikely that any single forecasting model would accurately account for each disease and for all time, leading to significant forecast model uncertainty. Yet, forecasting models for ED admissions to-date do not explore the utility of forecast combinations to improve forecast accuracy and stability. It is also unknown whether improvements in forecast accuracy can be yield from (1) incorporating a large number of environmental and anthropogenic covariates or (2) forecasting total ED causes by aggregating cause-specific ED forecasts. To address this gap, we propose high-dimensional forecast combination schemes to combine a large number of forecasting individual models for forecasting cause-specific ED admissions over multiple causes and forecast horizons. We use time series data of ED admissions with an extensive set of explanatory lagged variables at the national level, including meteorological/ambient air pollutant variables and ED admissions of all 16 causes studied. We show that the simple forecast combinations yield forecast accuracies of around 3.81%-23.54% across causes. Furthermore, forecast combinations outperform individual forecasting models, in more than 50% of scenarios (across all ED admission categories and horizons) in a statistically significant manner. Inclusion of high-dimensional covariates and aggregating cause-specific forecasts to provide all-cause ED forecasts provided modest improvements in forecast accuracy. Forecasting cause-specific ED admissions can provide fine-scale forward guidance on resource optimization and pandemic preparedness and forecast combinations can be used to hedge against model uncertainty when forecasting across a wide range of admission categories.</p></details> |  |
| **[Collaborative Imputation of Urban Time Series through Cross-city Meta-learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11306v1)** | 2025-01-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Urban time series, such as mobility flows, energy consumption, and pollution records, encapsulate complex urban dynamics and structures. However, data collection in each city is impeded by technical challenges such as budget limitations and sensor failures, necessitating effective data imputation techniques that can enhance data quality and reliability. Existing imputation models, categorized into learning-based and analytics-based paradigms, grapple with the trade-off between capacity and generalizability. Collaborative learning to reconstruct data across multiple cities holds the promise of breaking this trade-off. Nevertheless, urban data's inherent irregularity and heterogeneity issues exacerbate challenges of knowledge sharing and collaboration across cities. To address these limitations, we propose a novel collaborative imputation paradigm leveraging meta-learned implicit neural representations (INRs). INRs offer a continuous mapping from domain coordinates to target values, integrating the strengths of both paradigms. By imposing embedding theory, we first employ continuous parameterization to handle irregularity and reconstruct the dynamical system. We then introduce a cross-city collaborative learning scheme through model-agnostic meta learning, incorporating hierarchical modulation and normalization techniques to accommodate multiscale representations and reduce variance in response to heterogeneity. Extensive experiments on a diverse urban dataset from 20 global cities demonstrate our model's superior imputation performance and generalizability, underscoring the effectiveness of collaborative imputation in resource-constrained settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multivariate Wireless Link Quality Prediction Based on Pre-trained Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11247v1)** | 2025-01-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate and reliable link quality prediction (LQP) is crucial for optimizing network performance, ensuring communication stability, and enhancing user experience in wireless communications. However, LQP faces significant challenges due to the dynamic and lossy nature of wireless links, which are influenced by interference, multipath effects, fading, and blockage. In this paper, we propose GAT-LLM, a novel multivariate wireless link quality prediction model that combines Large Language Models (LLMs) with Graph Attention Networks (GAT) to enable accurate and reliable multivariate LQP of wireless communications. By framing LQP as a time series prediction task and appropriately preprocessing the input data, we leverage LLMs to improve the accuracy of link quality prediction. To address the limitations of LLMs in multivariate prediction due to typically handling one-dimensional data, we integrate GAT to model interdependencies among multiple variables across different protocol layers, enhancing the model's ability to handle complex dependencies. Experimental results demonstrate that GAT-LLM significantly improves the accuracy and robustness of link quality prediction, particularly in multi-step prediction scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[On Testing Kronecker Product Structure in Tensor Factor Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11208v1)** | 2025-01-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a test for testing the Kronecker product structure of a factor loading matrix implied by a tensor factor model with Tucker decomposition in the common component. Through defining a Kronecker product structure set, we define if a tensor time series response $\{\mathcal{Y}_t\}$ has a Kronecker product structure, equivalent to the ability to decompose $\{\mathcal{Y}_t\}$ according to a tensor factor model. Our test is built on analysing and comparing the residuals from fitting a full tensor factor model, and the residuals from fitting a (tensor) factor model on a reshaped version of the data. In the most extreme case, the reshaping is the vectorisation of the tensor data, and the factor loading matrix in such a case can be general if there is no Kronecker product structure present. Theoretical results are developed through asymptotic normality results on estimated residuals. Numerical experiments suggest that the size of the tests gets closer to the pre-set nominal value as the sample size or the order of the tensor gets larger, while the power increases with mode dimensions and the number of combined modes. We demonstrate out tests through a NYC taxi traffic data and a Fama-French matrix portfolio of returns.</p></details> | 48 pages, 0 figures |

Although these techniques are effective in certain tasks, they have yet to be generalized to time series benchmarks. We find that current data augmentation techniques ruin the core information contained within the frequency domain. To address this issue, we propose a simple strategy to preserve spectral information (SimPSI) in time series data augmentation. SimPSI preserves the spectral information by mixing the original and augmented input spectrum weighted by a preservation map, which indicates the importance score of each frequency. Specifically, our experimental contributions are to build three distinct preservation maps: magnitude spectrum, saliency map, and spectrum-preservative map. We apply SimPSI to various time series data augmentations and evaluate its effectiveness across a wide range of time series benchmarks. Our experimental results support that SimPSI considerably enhances the performance of time series data augmentations by preserving core spectral information.

| **[Large covariance matrix estimation with factor-assisted variable clustering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10942v1)** | 2025-01-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper studies the covariance matrix estimation for high-dimensional time series within a new framework that combines low-rank factor and latent variable-specific cluster structures. The popular methods based on assuming the sparse error covariance matrix after taking out common factors may be invalid for many financial applications. Our formulation postulates a latent model-based error cluster structure after removing observable factors, which not only leads to more interpretable cluster patterns but also accounts for non-sparse cross-sectional correlations among the variable-specific residuals. Our method begins with using least-squares to estimate the factor loadings, followed by identifying the latent cluster structure by thresholding the scaled covariance difference measures of residuals. A novel ratio-based criterion is introduced to determine the threshold parameter when performing the developed clustering algorithm. We then establish the cluster recovery consistency of our method and derive the convergence rates of our proposed covariance matrix estimators under different norms. Finally, we demonstrate the superior finite sample performance of our proposal over the competing methods through both extensive simulations and a real data application on minimum variance portfolio.</p></details> |  |
| **[Architecture-Aware Learning Curve Extrapolation via Graph Ordinary Differential Equation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15554v3)** | 2025-01-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning curve extrapolation predicts neural network performance from early training epochs and has been applied to accelerate AutoML, facilitating hyperparameter tuning and neural architecture search. However, existing methods typically model the evolution of learning curves in isolation, neglecting the impact of neural network (NN) architectures, which influence the loss landscape and learning trajectories. In this work, we explore whether incorporating neural network architecture improves learning curve modeling and how to effectively integrate this architectural information. Motivated by the dynamical system view of optimization, we propose a novel architecture-aware neural differential equation model to forecast learning curves continuously. We empirically demonstrate its ability to capture the general trend of fluctuating learning curves while quantifying uncertainty through variational parameters. Our model outperforms current state-of-the-art learning curve extrapolation methods and pure time-series modeling approaches for both MLP and CNN-based learning curves. Additionally, we explore the applicability of our method in Neural Architecture Search scenarios, such as training configuration ranking.</p></details> | Accepted to AAAI'25 |
| **[Linear scaling causal discovery from high-dimensional time series by dynamical community detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10886v1)** | 2025-01-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding which parts of a dynamical system cause each other is extremely relevant in fundamental and applied sciences. However, inferring causal links from observational data, namely without direct manipulations of the system, is still computationally challenging, especially if the data are high-dimensional. In this study we introduce a framework for constructing causal graphs from high-dimensional time series, whose computational cost scales linearly with the number of variables. The approach is based on the automatic identification of dynamical communities, groups of variables which mutually influence each other and can therefore be described as a single node in a causal graph. These communities are efficiently identified by optimizing the Information Imbalance, a statistical quantity that assigns a weight to each putative causal variable based on its information content relative to a target variable. The communities are then ordered starting from the fully autonomous ones, whose evolution is independent from all the others, to those that are progressively dependent on other communities, building in this manner a community causal graph. We demonstrate the computational efficiency and the accuracy of our approach on time-discrete and time-continuous dynamical systems including up to 80 variables.</p></details> |  |
| **[Predicting Energy Budgets in Droplet Dynamics: A Recurrent Neural Network Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16144v2)** | 2025-01-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural networks in fluid mechanics offer an efficient approach for exploring complex flows, including multiphase and free surface flows. The recurrent neural network, particularly the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model, proves attractive for learning mappings from transient inputs to dynamic outputs. This study applies LSTM to predict transient and static outputs for fluid flows under surface tension effects. Specifically, we explore two distinct droplet dynamic scenarios: droplets with diverse initial shapes impacting with solid surfaces, as well as the coalescence of two droplets following collision. Using only dimensionless numbers and geometric time series data from numerical simulations, LSTM predicts the energy budget. The marker-and-cell front-tracking methodology combined with a marker-and-cell finite-difference strategy is adopted for simulating the droplet dynamics. Using a recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture fed with time series data derived from geometrical parameters, as for example droplet diameter variation, our study shows the accuracy of our approach in predicting energy budgets, as for instance the kinetic, dissipation, and surface energy trends, across a range of Reynolds and Weber numbers in droplet dynamic problems. Finally, a two-phase sequential neural network using only geometric data, which is readily available in experimental settings, is employed to predict the energies and then use them to estimate static parameters, such as the Reynolds and Weber numbers. While our methodology has been primarily validated with simulation data, its adaptability to experimental datasets is a promising avenue for future exploration. We hope that our strategy can be useful for diverse applications, spanning from inkjet printing to combustion engines, where the prediction of energy budgets or dissipation energies is crucial.</p></details> |  |
| **[Elucidating the Design Choice of Probability Paths in Flow Matching for Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03229v2)** | 2025-01-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Flow matching has recently emerged as a powerful paradigm for generative modeling and has been extended to probabilistic time series forecasting in latent spaces. However, the impact of the specific choice of probability path model on forecasting performance remains under-explored. In this work, we demonstrate that forecasting spatio-temporal data with flow matching is highly sensitive to the selection of the probability path model. Motivated by this insight, we propose a novel probability path model designed to improve forecasting performance. Our empirical results across various dynamical system benchmarks show that our model achieves faster convergence during training and improved predictive performance compared to existing probability path models. Importantly, our approach is efficient during inference, requiring only a few sampling steps. This makes our proposed model practical for real-world applications and opens new avenues for probabilistic forecasting.</p></details> | 33 pages |

The lack of instrumental data during this period poses significant challenges to understanding past climate conditions. REACHES digitizes historical documents from the Ming and Qing dynasties of China, converting qualitative descriptions into a four-level ordinal temperature scale. However, these index-based data are biased toward abnormal or extreme weather phenomena, leading to data gaps that likely correspond to normal conditions. To address this bias and reconstruct historical temperatures at any point within East Asia, including locations without direct historical data, we employ a three-tiered statistical framework. First, we perform kriging to interpolate temperature data across East Asia, adopting a zero-mean assumption to handle missing information. Next, we utilize the Last Millennium Ensemble (LME) reanalysis data and apply quantile mapping to calibrate the kriged REACHES data to Celsius temperature scales. Finally, we introduce a novel Bayesian data assimilation method that integrates the kriged Celsius data with LME simulations to enhance reconstruction accuracy. We model the LME data at each geographic location using a flexible nonstationary autoregressive time series model and employ regularized maximum likelihood estimation with a fused lasso penalty. The resulting dynamic distribution serves as a prior, which is refined via Kalman filtering by incorporating the kriged Celsius REACHES data to yield posterior temperature estimates. This comprehensive integration of historical documentation, contemporary climate models, and advanced statistical methods improves the accuracy of historical temperature reconstructions and provides a crucial resource for future environmental and climate studies.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages, 16 figures, 1 table</p></details> |
| **[Speech Emotion Detection Based on MFCC and CNN-LSTM Architecture](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10666v1)** | 2025-01-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Emotion detection techniques have been applied to multiple cases mainly from facial image features and vocal audio features, of which the latter aspect is disputed yet not only due to the complexity of speech audio processing but also the difficulties of extracting appropriate features. Part of the SAVEE and RAVDESS datasets are selected and combined as the dataset, containing seven sorts of common emotions (i.e. happy, neutral, sad, anger, disgust, fear, and surprise) and thousands of samples. Based on the Librosa package, this paper processes the initial audio input into waveplot and spectrum for analysis and concentrates on multiple features including MFCC as targets for feature extraction. The hybrid CNN-LSTM architecture is adopted by virtue of its strong capability to deal with sequential data and time series, which mainly consists of four convolutional layers and three long short-term memory layers. As a result, the architecture achieved an accuracy of 61.07% comprehensively for the test set, among which the detection of anger and neutral reaches a performance of 75.31% and 71.70% respectively. It can also be concluded that the classification accuracy is dependent on the properties of emotion to some extent, with frequently-used and distinct-featured emotions having less probability to be misclassified into other categories. Emotions like surprise whose meaning depends on the specific context are more likely to confuse with positive or negative emotions, and negative emotions also have a possibility to get mixed with each other.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 5 figures, Applied and Computational Engineering</p></details> |

Building upon this foundation, the Neural negative binomial INGARCH (neu - NB-INGARCH) model is proposed, designed to enhance predictive accuracy while accommodating moderate non-stationarity in count time series data. A simulation study and data analysis demonstrate the efficacy of the sp NB-INGARCH model, while the practical utility of the neu - NB - INGARCH model is showcased through a comprehensive analysis of a healthcare data. Additionally, a thorough literature review is presented, focusing on the application of neural networks in time series modeling, with particular emphasis on count time series. In short, this work contributes to advancing the theoretical understanding and practical application of neural network-based models in count time series forecasting.</p></details> |  |
| **[Assessing Markov Property in Driving Behaviors: Insights from Statistical Tests](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10625v1)** | 2025-01-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Markov property serves as a foundational assumption in most existing work on vehicle driving behavior, positing that future states depend solely on the current state, not the series of preceding states. This study validates the Markov properties of vehicle trajectories for both Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) and Human-driven Vehicles (HVs). A statistical method used to test whether time series data exhibits Markov properties is applied to examine whether the trajectory data possesses Markov characteristics. t test and F test are additionally introduced to characterize the differences in Markov properties between AVs and HVs. Based on two public trajectory datasets, we investigate the presence and order of the Markov property of different types of vehicles through rigorous statistical tests. Our findings reveal that AV trajectories generally exhibit stronger Markov properties compared to HV trajectories, with a higher percentage conforming to the Markov property and lower Markov orders. In contrast, HV trajectories display greater variability and heterogeneity in decision-making processes, reflecting the complex perception and information processing involved in human driving. These results have significant implications for the development of driving behavior models, AV controllers, and traffic simulation systems. Our study also demonstrates the feasibility of using statistical methods to test the presence of Markov properties in driving trajectory data.</p></details> |  |

We find that VLMs produce competitive results after two or less epochs of fine-tuning. We develop a novel approach that incorporates graphical data representations as images in conjunction with numerical data. This approach is rooted in the hypothesis that graphical representations can provide additional contextual information that numerical data alone may not capture. Additionally, providing a graphical representation can circumvent issues such as limited context length faced by LLMs. To further advance this work, we implemented a scalable end-to-end pipeline for training on different scenarios, allowing us to isolate the most effective strategies for transferring learning capabilities from LLMs to Time Series Classification (TSC) tasks. Our approach works with univariate and multivariate time-series data. In addition, we conduct extensive and practical experiments to show how this approach works for time-series classification and generative labels.</p></details> |  |

However, efforts to estimate multiple dynamic quantiles jointly have been limited. Existing approaches either sequentially estimate fitted quantiles or impose restrictive assumptions on the data generating process. This paper fills this gap by proposing an objective function for the joint estimation of all quantiles, introducing a crossing penalty to guide the process. Monte Carlo experiments and an empirical application on the FTSE100 validate the effectiveness of the method, offering a flexible and robust approach to modelling multiple dynamic quantiles in time-series data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Future-Guided Learning: A Predictive Approach To Enhance Time-Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15217v2)** | 2025-01-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate time-series forecasting is crucial in various scientific and industrial domains, yet deep learning models often struggle to capture long-term dependencies and adapt to data distribution drifts over time. We introduce Future-Guided Learning, an approach that enhances time-series event forecasting through a dynamic feedback mechanism inspired by predictive coding. Our method involves two models: a detection model that analyzes future data to identify critical events and a forecasting model that predicts these events based on current data. When discrepancies occur between the forecasting and detection models, a more significant update is applied to the forecasting model, effectively minimizing surprise and adapting to shifts in the data distribution by aligning its predictions with actual future outcomes. This feedback loop allows the forecasting model to dynamically adjust its parameters, focusing on persistent features despite changes in the data. We validate our approach on a variety of tasks, demonstrating a 44.8% increase in AUC-ROC for seizure prediction using EEG data, and a 48.7% reduction in MSE for forecasting in nonlinear dynamical systems. By incorporating a predictive feedback mechanism adaptable to data drift, Future-Guided Learning advances how deep learning is applied to time-series forecasting. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/SkyeGunasekaran/FutureGuidedLearning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Uncertainty-Aware Digital Twins: Robust Model Predictive Control using Time-Series Deep Quantile Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10337v1)** | 2025-01-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Digital Twins, virtual replicas of physical systems that enable real-time monitoring, model updates, predictions, and decision-making, present novel avenues for proactive control strategies for autonomous systems. However, achieving real-time decision-making in Digital Twins considering uncertainty necessitates an efficient uncertainty quantification (UQ) approach and optimization driven by accurate predictions of system behaviors, which remains a challenge for learning-based methods. This paper presents a simultaneous multi-step robust model predictive control (MPC) framework that incorporates real-time decision-making with uncertainty awareness for Digital Twin systems. Leveraging a multistep ahead predictor named Time-Series Dense Encoder (TiDE) as the surrogate model, this framework differs from conventional MPC models that provide only one-step ahead predictions. In contrast, TiDE can predict future states within the prediction horizon in a one-shot, significantly accelerating MPC. Furthermore, quantile regression is employed with the training of TiDE to perform flexible while computationally efficient UQ on data uncertainty. Consequently, with the deep learning quantiles, the robust MPC problem is formulated into a deterministic optimization problem and provides a safety buffer that accommodates disturbances to enhance constraint satisfaction rate. As a result, the proposed method outperforms existing robust MPC methods by providing less-conservative UQ and has demonstrated efficacy in an engineering case study involving Directed Energy Deposition (DED) additive manufacturing. This proactive while uncertainty-aware control capability positions the proposed method as a potent tool for future Digital Twin applications and real-time process control in engineering systems.</p></details> |  |

While previous research has focused on creating increasingly efficient intervals, we argue that standard measures alone are inadequate. Beyond efficiency, prediction intervals must adapt their width based on the difficulty of the prediction while preserving coverage regardless of complexity. To address these issues, we propose combining Heteroscedastic Quantile Regression (HQR) with Width-Adaptive Conformal Inference (WACI). This integrated procedure guarantees theoretical coverage and enables interval widths to vary with predictive uncertainty. We assess its performance using both a synthetic example and a real world Electricity Price Forecasting scenario. Our results show that this combined approach meets or surpasses typical benchmarks for validity and efficiency, while also fulfilling important yet often overlooked practical requirements.</p></details> |  |
| **[SpaceTime: Causal Discovery from Non-Stationary Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10235v1)** | 2025-01-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding causality is challenging and often complicated by changing causal relationships over time and across environments. Climate patterns, for example, shift over time with recurring seasonal trends, while also depending on geographical characteristics such as ecosystem variability. Existing methods for discovering causal graphs from time series either assume stationarity, do not permit both temporal and spatial distribution changes, or are unaware of locations with the same causal relationships. In this work, we therefore unify the three tasks of causal graph discovery in the non-stationary multi-context setting, of reconstructing temporal regimes, and of partitioning datasets and time intervals into those where invariant causal relationships hold. To construct a consistent score that forms the basis of our method, we employ the Minimum Description Length principle. Our resulting algorithm SPACETIME simultaneously accounts for heterogeneity across space and non-stationarity over time. Given multiple time series, it discovers regime changepoints and a temporal causal graph using non-parametric functional modeling and kernelized discrepancy testing. We also show that our method provides insights into real-world phenomena such as river-runoff measured at different catchments and biosphere-atmosphere interactions across ecosystems.</p></details> |  |

We evaluate these models across multiple time horizons and user categories, with a focus on the impact of historical context length. Our analysis reveals that while Chronos demonstrates superior performance for longer-term predictions and maintains accuracy with increased context, traditional models show significant degradation as context length increases. We find that prediction quality varies systematically between user classes, suggesting that underlying behavior patterns always influence model performance. This study provides a case for deploying Chronos in real-world applications where limited model tuning is feasible, especially in scenarios requiring longer prediction.</p></details> |  |

Remote sensing has the potential to mitigate these effects by supporting sustainable development strategies with accurate information on urban growth. Deep learning-based methods have achieved promising urban change detection results from optical satellite image pairs using convolutional neural networks (ConvNets), transformers, and a multi-task learning setup. However, transformers have not been leveraged for urban change detection with multi-temporal data, i.e., >2 images, and multi-task learning methods lack integration approaches that combine change and segmentation outputs. To fill this research gap, we propose a continuous urban change detection method that identifies changes in each consecutive image pair of a satellite image time series (SITS). Specifically, we propose a temporal feature refinement (TFR) module that utilizes self-attention to improve ConvNet-based multi-temporal building representations. Furthermore, we propose a multi-task integration (MTI) module that utilizes Markov networks to find an optimal building map time series based on segmentation and dense change outputs. The proposed method effectively identifies urban changes based on high-resolution SITS acquired by the PlanetScope constellation (F1 score 0.551) and Gaofen-2 (F1 score 0.440). Moreover, our experiments on two challenging datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method compared to bi-temporal and multi-temporal urban change detection and segmentation methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review at IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing, Code will be available at https://github.com/SebastianHafner/ContUrbanCD.git</p></details> |

In this study, we adopt an efficient two-level clustering approach to automatically identify seasons using the clear sky irradiance in first level and subsequently to identify daily cloud level as clear, cloudy and partly cloudy within each season in second level. In the second level of clustering, three methods are compared, namely, Daily Irradiance Index (DII or $\beta$), Euclidean Distance (ED), and Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) distance. The DII is computed as the ratio of time integral of measured irradiance to time integral of the clear sky irradiance. The identified clusters were compared quantitatively using established clustering metrics and qualitatively by comparing the mean irradiance profiles. The results clearly establish the superiority of the $\beta$-based clustering approach as the leader, setting a new benchmark for solar irradiance clustering studies. Moreover, $\beta$-based clustering remains effective even for annual data unlike the time-series methods which suffer significant performance degradation. Interestingly, contrary to expectations, ED-based clustering outperforms the more compute-intensive DTW distance-based clustering. The method has been rigorously validated using data from two distinct US locations, demonstrating robust scalability for larger datasets and potential applicability for other locations.</p></details> | <details><summary>30 pa...</summary><p>30 pages, 9 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |

Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction using Scene Features](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13848v1)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate prediction of pedestrian trajectories is crucial for enhancing the safety of autonomous vehicles and reducing traffic fatalities involving pedestrians. While numerous studies have focused on modeling interactions among pedestrians to forecast their movements, the influence of environmental factors and scene-object placements has been comparatively underexplored. In this paper, we present a novel trajectory prediction model that integrates both pedestrian interactions and environmental context to improve prediction accuracy. Our approach captures spatial and temporal interactions among pedestrians within a sparse graph framework. To account for pedestrian-scene interactions, we employ advanced image enhancement and semantic segmentation techniques to extract detailed scene features. These scene and interaction features are then fused through a cross-attention mechanism, enabling the model to prioritize relevant environmental factors that influence pedestrian movements. Finally, a temporal convolutional network processes the fused features to predict future pedestrian trajectories. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches, achieving ADE and FDE values of 0.252 and 0.372 meters, respectively, underscoring the importance of incorporating both social interactions and environmental context in pedestrian trajectory prediction.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by 2024 International Conference on Intelligent Computing and its Emerging Applications</p></details> |
| **[In-Trajectory Inverse Reinforcement Learning: Learn Incrementally Before An Ongoing Trajectory Terminates](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15612v5)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) aims to learn a reward function and a corresponding policy that best fit the demonstrated trajectories of an expert. However, current IRL works cannot learn incrementally from an ongoing trajectory because they have to wait to collect at least one complete trajectory to learn. To bridge the gap, this paper considers the problem of learning a reward function and a corresponding policy while observing the initial state-action pair of an ongoing trajectory and keeping updating the learned reward and policy when new state-action pairs of the ongoing trajectory are observed. We formulate this problem as an online bi-level optimization problem where the upper level dynamically adjusts the learned reward according to the newly observed state-action pairs with the help of a meta-regularization term, and the lower level learns the corresponding policy. We propose a novel algorithm to solve this problem and guarantee that the algorithm achieves sub-linear local regret $O(\sqrt{T}+\log T+\sqrt{T}\log T)$. If the reward function is linear, we prove that the proposed algorithm achieves sub-linear regret $O(\log T)$. Experiments are used to validate the proposed algorithm.</p></details> |  |
| **[Knowledge-Informed Multi-Agent Trajectory Prediction at Signalized Intersections for Infrastructure-to-Everything](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13461v1)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-agent trajectory prediction at signalized intersections is crucial for developing efficient intelligent transportation systems and safe autonomous driving systems. Due to the complexity of intersection scenarios and the limitations of single-vehicle perception, the performance of vehicle-centric prediction methods has reached a plateau. Furthermore, most works underutilize critical intersection information, including traffic signals, and behavior patterns induced by road structures. Therefore, we propose a multi-agent trajectory prediction framework at signalized intersections dedicated to Infrastructure-to-Everything (I2XTraj). Our framework leverages dynamic graph attention to integrate knowledge from traffic signals and driving behaviors. A continuous signal-informed mechanism is proposed to adaptively process real-time traffic signals from infrastructure devices. Additionally, leveraging the prior knowledge of the intersection topology, we propose a driving strategy awareness mechanism to model the joint distribution of goal intentions and maneuvers. To the best of our knowledge, I2XTraj represents the first multi-agent trajectory prediction framework explicitly designed for infrastructure deployment, supplying subscribable prediction services to all vehicles at intersections. I2XTraj demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on both the Vehicle-to-Infrastructure dataset V2X-Seq and the aerial-view dataset SinD for signalized intersections. Quantitative evaluations show that our approach outperforms existing methods by more than 30% in both multi-agent and single-agent scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Zero-Shot Trajectory Planning for Signal Temporal Logic Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13457v1)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Signal Temporal Logic (STL) is a powerful specification language for describing complex temporal behaviors of continuous signals, making it well-suited for high-level robotic task descriptions. However, generating executable plans for STL tasks is challenging, as it requires consideration of the coupling between the task specification and the system dynamics. Existing approaches either follow a model-based setting that explicitly requires knowledge of the system dynamics or adopt a task-oriented data-driven approach to learn plans for specific tasks. In this work, we investigate the problem of generating executable STL plans for systems whose dynamics are unknown a priori. We propose a new planning framework that uses only task-agnostic data during the offline training stage, enabling zero-shot generalization to new STL tasks. Our framework is hierarchical, involving: (i) decomposing the STL task into a set of progress and time constraints, (ii) searching for time-aware waypoints guided by task-agnostic data, and (iii) generating trajectories using a pre-trained safe diffusion model. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method indeed in achieving zero-shot generalization to various STL tasks.</p></details> | submitted |
| **[One Fits All: General Mobility Trajectory Modeling via Masked Conditional Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13347v1)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory data play a crucial role in many applications, ranging from network optimization to urban planning. Existing studies on trajectory data are task-specific, and their applicability is limited to the specific tasks on which they have been trained, such as generation, recovery, or prediction. However, the potential of a unified model has not yet been fully explored in trajectory modeling. Although various trajectory tasks differ in inputs, outputs, objectives, and conditions, they share common mobility patterns. Based on these common patterns, we can construct a general framework that enables a single model to address different tasks. However, building a trajectory task-general framework faces two critical challenges: 1) the diversity in the formats of different tasks and 2) the complexity of the conditions imposed on different tasks. In this work, we propose a general trajectory modeling framework via masked conditional diffusion (named GenMove). Specifically, we utilize mask conditions to unify diverse formats. To adapt to complex conditions associated with different tasks, we utilize historical trajectory data to obtain contextual trajectory embeddings, which include rich contexts such as spatiotemporal characteristics and user preferences. Integrating the contextual trajectory embedding into diffusion models through a classifier-free guidance approach allows the model to flexibly adjust its outputs based on different conditions. Extensive experiments on mainstream tasks demonstrate that our model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, with the highest performance improvement exceeding 13% in generation tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Spatio-temporal Graph Network Allowing Incomplete Trajectory Input for Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13973v1)** | 2025-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pedestrian trajectory prediction is important in the research of mobile robot navigation in environments with pedestrians. Most pedestrian trajectory prediction algorithms require the input historical trajectories to be complete. If a pedestrian is unobservable in any frame in the past, then its historical trajectory become incomplete, the algorithm will not predict its future trajectory. To address this limitation, we propose the STGN-IT, a spatio-temporal graph network allowing incomplete trajectory input, which can predict the future trajectories of pedestrians with incomplete historical trajectories. STGN-IT uses the spatio-temporal graph with an additional encoding method to represent the historical trajectories and observation states of pedestrians. Moreover, STGN-IT introduces static obstacles in the environment that may affect the future trajectories as nodes to further improve the prediction accuracy. A clustering algorithm is also applied in the construction of spatio-temporal graphs. Experiments on public datasets show that STGN-IT outperforms state of the art algorithms on these metrics.</p></details> |  |

We apply state feedback linearisation control for the process and propose a simplified implementation of the model control loop which results in a simple model in Brunovsky-form that represents the nominal feedback linearised dynamics of the nonlinear process. To compensate possibly unmatched model uncertainties, we employ Lyapunov redesign with numeric derivatives of the output. It turns out that for a special initialisation of the model, the MFC reduces to a single-loop control design. We illustrate our results by a numerical example.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning segmentation from point trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12392v1)** | 2025-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider the problem of segmenting objects in videos based on their motion and no other forms of supervision. Prior work has often approached this problem by using the principle of common fate, namely the fact that the motion of points that belong to the same object is strongly correlated. However, most authors have only considered instantaneous motion from optical flow. In this work, we present a way to train a segmentation network using long-term point trajectories as a supervisory signal to complement optical flow. The key difficulty is that long-term motion, unlike instantaneous motion, is difficult to model -- any parametric approximation is unlikely to capture complex motion patterns over long periods of time. We instead draw inspiration from subspace clustering approaches, proposing a loss function that seeks to group the trajectories into low-rank matrices where the motion of object points can be approximately explained as a linear combination of other point tracks. Our method outperforms the prior art on motion-based segmentation, which shows the utility of long-term motion and the effectiveness of our formulation.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2024 Spotlight.

| **[Algorithm Selection with Probing Trajectories: Benchmarking the Choice of Classifier Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11414v1)** | 2025-01-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent approaches to training algorithm selectors in the black-box optimisation domain have advocated for the use of training data that is algorithm-centric in order to encapsulate information about how an algorithm performs on an instance, rather than relying on information derived from features of the instance itself. Probing-trajectories that consist of a sequence of objective performance per function evaluation obtained from a short run of an algorithm have recently shown particular promise in training accurate selectors. However, training models on this type of data requires an appropriately chosen classifier given the sequential nature of the data. There are currently no clear guidelines for choosing the most appropriate classifier for algorithm selection using time-series data from the plethora of models available. To address this, we conduct a large benchmark study using 17 different classifiers and three types of trajectory on a classification task using the BBOB benchmark suite using both leave-one-instance out and leave-one-problem out cross-validation. In contrast to previous studies using tabular data, we find that the choice of classifier has a significant impact, showing that feature-based and interval-based models are the best choices.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in Applications of Evolutionary Computation 28th International Conference, EvoApplications 2025</p></details> |
| **[Spatio-temporal characterisation of underwater noise through semantic trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11131v1)** | 2025-01-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Underwater noise pollution from human activities, particularly shipping, has been recognised as a serious threat to marine life. The sound generated by vessels can have various adverse effects on fish and aquatic ecosystems in general. In this setting, the estimation and analysis of the underwater noise produced by vessels is an important challenge for the preservation of the marine environment. In this paper we propose a model for the spatio-temporal characterisation of the underwater noise generated by vessels. The approach is based on the reconstruction of the vessels' trajectories from Automatic Identification System (AIS) data and on their deployment in a spatio-temporal database. Trajectories are enriched with semantic information like the acoustic characteristics of the vessels' engines or the activity performed by the vessels. We define a model for underwater noise propagation and use the trajectories' information to infer how noise propagates in the area of interest. We develop our approach for the case study of the fishery activities in the Northern Adriatic sea, an area of the Mediterranean sea which is well known to be highly exploited. We implement our approach using MobilityDB, an open source geospatial trajectory data management and analysis platform, which offers spatio-temporal operators and indexes improving the efficiency of our system. We use this platform to conduct various analyses of the underwater noise generated in the Northern Adriatic Sea, aiming at estimating the impact of fishing activities on underwater noise pollution and at demonstrating the flexibility and expressiveness of our approach.</p></details> |  |

To further enhance temporal features, we introduce a Temporal Feature Enhancement Module, which integrates spectral features into temporal data using residual cross-attention. This enhanced temporal information is then employed for precise 3D trajectory estimation and classification.

| **[Audio Array-Based 3D UAV Trajectory Estimation with LiDAR Pseudo-Labeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12698v5)** | 2025-01-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As small unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) become increasingly prevalent, there is growing concern regarding their impact on public safety and privacy, highlighting the need for advanced tracking and trajectory estimation solutions. In response, this paper introduces a novel framework that utilizes audio array for 3D UAV trajectory estimation. Our approach incorporates a self-supervised learning model, starting with the conversion of audio data into mel-spectrograms, which are analyzed through an encoder to extract crucial temporal and spectral information. Simultaneously, UAV trajectories are estimated using LiDAR point clouds via unsupervised methods. These LiDAR-based estimations act as pseudo labels, enabling the training of an Audio Perception Network without requiring labeled data. In this architecture, the LiDAR-based system operates as the Teacher Network, guiding the Audio Perception Network, which serves as the Student Network. Once trained, the model can independently predict 3D trajectories using only audio signals, with no need for LiDAR data or external ground truth during deployment. To further enhance precision, we apply Gaussian Process modeling for improved spatiotemporal tracking. Our method delivers top-tier performance on the MMAUD dataset, establishing a new benchmark in trajectory estimation using self-supervised learning techniques without reliance on ground truth annotations.</p></details> | Accepted for ICASSP |
| **[Three-dimensional Trajectory Optimization for Quadrotor Tail-sitter UAVs: Traversing through Given Waypoints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08347v3)** | 2025-01-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Given the evolving application scenarios of current fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), it is necessary for UAVs to possess agile and rapid 3-dimensional flight capabilities. Typically, the trajectory of a tail-sitter is generated separately for vertical and level flights. This limits the tail-sitter's ability to move in a 3-dimensional airspace and makes it difficult to establish a smooth transition between vertical and level flights. In the present work, a 3-dimensional trajectory optimization method is proposed for quadrotor tail-sitters. Especially, the differential dynamics constraints are eliminated when generating the trajectory of the tail-sitter by utilizing differential flatness method. Additionally, the temporal parameters of the trajectory are generated using the state-of-the-art trajectory generation method called MINCO (minimum control). Subsequently, we convert the speed constraint on the vehicle into a soft constraint by discretizing the trajectory in time. This increases the likelihood that the control input limits are satisfied and the trajectory is feasible. Then, we utilize a kind of model predictive control (MPC) method to track trajectories. Even if restricting the tail-sitter's motion to a 2-dimensional horizontal plane, the solutions still outperform those of the L1 Guidance Law and Dubins path.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient and Safe Trajectory Planning for Autonomous Agricultural Vehicle Headland Turning in Cluttered Orchard Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10636v1)** | 2025-01-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous agricultural vehicles (AAVs), including field robots and autonomous tractors, are becoming essential in modern farming by improving efficiency and reducing labor costs. A critical task in AAV operations is headland turning between crop rows. This task is challenging in orchards with limited headland space, irregular boundaries, operational constraints, and static obstacles. While traditional trajectory planning methods work well in arable farming, they often fail in cluttered orchard environments. This letter presents a novel trajectory planner that enhances the safety and efficiency of AAV headland maneuvers, leveraging advancements in autonomous driving. Our approach includes an efficient front-end algorithm and a high-performance back-end optimization. Applied to vehicles with various implements, it outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both standard and challenging orchard fields. This work bridges agricultural and autonomous driving technologies, facilitating a broader adoption of AAVs in complex orchards.</p></details> |  |
| **[On Learning Informative Trajectory Embeddings for Imitation, Classification and Regression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09327v2)** | 2025-01-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In real-world sequential decision making tasks like autonomous driving, robotics, and healthcare, learning from observed state-action trajectories is critical for tasks like imitation, classification, and clustering. For example, self-driving cars must replicate human driving behaviors, while robots and healthcare systems benefit from modeling decision sequences, whether or not they come from expert data. Existing trajectory encoding methods often focus on specific tasks or rely on reward signals, limiting their ability to generalize across domains and tasks. Inspired by the success of embedding models like CLIP and BERT in static domains, we propose a novel method for embedding state-action trajectories into a latent space that captures the skills and competencies in the dynamic underlying decision-making processes. This method operates without the need for reward labels, enabling better generalization across diverse domains and tasks. Our contributions are threefold: (1) We introduce a trajectory embedding approach that captures multiple abilities from state-action data. (2) The learned embeddings exhibit strong representational power across downstream tasks, including imitation, classification, clustering, and regression. (3) The embeddings demonstrate unique properties, such as controlling agent behaviors in IQ-Learn and an additive structure in the latent space. Experimental results confirm that our method outperforms traditional approaches, offering more flexible and powerful trajectory representations for various applications.

We propose a non-autoregressive transformer architecture to leverage its parallel nature for easier training and fast, accurate predictions at test time. The proposed architecture divides human motion prediction into two parts: 1) the human trajectory, which is the hip joint 3D position over time and 2) the human pose which is the all other joints 3D positions over time with respect to a fixed hip joint. We propose to make the two predictions simultaneously, as the shared representation can improve the model performance. Therefore, the model consists of two sets of encoders and decoders. First, a multi-head attention module applied to encoder outputs improves human trajectory. Second, another multi-head self-attention module applied to encoder outputs concatenated with decoder outputs facilitates learning of temporal dependencies. Our model is well-suited for robotic applications in terms of test accuracy and speed, and compares favorably with respect to state-of-the-art methods. We demonstrate the real-world applicability of our work via the Robot Follow-Ahead task, a challenging yet practical case study for our proposed model.</p></details> |  |
| **[BILTS: A Bi-Invariant Similarity Measure for Robust Object Trajectory Recognition under Reference Frame Variations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04392v2)** | 2025-01-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>When similar object motions are performed in diverse contexts but are meant to be recognized under a single classification, these contextual variations act as disturbances that negatively affect accurate motion recognition. In this paper, we focus on contextual variations caused by reference frame variations. To robustly deal with these variations, similarity measures have been introduced that compare object motion trajectories in a context-invariant manner. However, most are highly sensitive to noise near singularities, where the measure is not uniquely defined, and lack bi-invariance (invariance to both world and body frame variations). To address these issues, we propose the novel \textit{Bi-Invariant Local Trajectory-Shape Similarity} (BILTS) measure. Compared to other measures, the BILTS measure uniquely offers bi-invariance, boundedness, and third-order shape identity. Aimed at practical implementations, we devised a discretized and regularized version of the BILTS measure which shows exceptional robustness to singularities. This is demonstrated through rigorous recognition experiments using multiple datasets. On average, BILTS attained the highest recognition ratio and least sensitivity to contextual variations compared to other invariant object motion similarity measures. We believe that the BILTS measure is a valuable tool for recognizing motions performed in diverse contexts and has potential in other applications, including the recognition, segmentation, and adaptation of both motion and force trajectories.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted as a regular research paper for consideration in the Journal of Intelligent & Robotic Systems.

We utilised a U-Net-based feature extractor, via its latent vector representation, to capture scene representations and a graph-aware transformer encoder for capturing social interactions. These components are integrated to learn an agent-scene aware embedding, enabling the model to learn spatial dynamics and forecast the future trajectory of pedestrians. The model is designed to produce both deterministic and stochastic outcomes, with the stochastic predictions being generated by incorporating a Conditional Variational Auto-Encoder (CVAE). ASTRA also proposes a simple yet effective weighted penalty loss function, which helps to yield predictions that outperform a wide array of state-of-the-art deterministic and generative models. ASTRA demonstrates an average improvement of 27%/10% in deterministic/stochastic settings on the ETH-UCY dataset, and 26% improvement on the PIE dataset, respectively, along with seven times fewer parameters than the existing state-of-the-art model (see Figure 1). Additionally, the model's versatility allows it to generalize across different perspectives, such as Bird's Eye View (BEV) and Ego-Vehicle View (EVV).</p></details> |  |

Strategies for planning minimum-energy trajectories typically involve solving nonlinear optimal control problems (OCPs), which rarely cope with real-time requirements. In this paper, we propose a paradigm for generating near minimum-energy trajectories for manipulators by learning from optimal solutions. Our paradigm leverages a residual learning approach, which embeds boundary conditions while focusing on learning only the adjustments needed to steer a standard solution to an optimal one. Compared to a computationally expensive OCP-based planner, our paradigm achieves 87.3% of the performance near the training dataset and 50.8% far from the dataset, while being two to three orders of magnitude faster.</p></details> |  |

The paper investigates the dynamical properties of the closed-loop systems, with a focus on characterizing undesirable behaviors that may emerge due to the use of CBF-based filters. These undesirable behaviors include unbounded trajectories, limit cycles, and undesired equilibria, which can be locally stable and even form a continuum. Our analysis offer the following contributions: (i) conditions under which trajectories remain bounded and (ii) conditions under which limit cycles do not exist; (iii) we show that undesired equilibria can be characterized by solving an algebraic equation, and (iv) we provide examples that show that asymptotically stable undesired equilibria can exist for a large class of nominal controllers and design parameters of the safety filter (even for convex safe sets). Further, for the specific class of planar systems, (v) we provide explicit formulas for the total number of undesired equilibria and the proportion of saddle points and asymptotically stable equilibria, and (vi) in the case of linear planar systems, we present an exhaustive analysis of their global stability properties. Examples throughout the paper illustrate the results.</p></details> |  |

The framework leverages the concept of regularity for set-valued output maps. Specifically, we demonstrate that, for output-regular maps, one can utilize a set-valued observability measure that is concave with respect to finite-horizon state trajectories. By maximizing this measure, optimized estimation-aware trajectories can be designed for a broad class of systems, including those with locally linearized dynamics. To illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, we provide a representative example in the context of trajectory planning for vision-based estimation. We present an estimation-aware trajectory for an uncooperative target-tracking problem that uses a machine learning (ML)-based estimation module on an ego-satellite.</p></details> | 25 pages, 5 figures |

The ineffectiveness comes from the conflict between the fact of asymmetric and multi-modal distribution of likely outcomes and symmetric and single-modal original distribution and supervision losses. Instead, we propose constructing a mixed Gaussian prior for a normalizing flow model for trajectory prediction. The prior is constructed by analyzing the trajectory patterns in the training samples without requiring extra annotations while showing better expressiveness and being multi-modal and asymmetric. Besides diversity, it also provides better controllability for probabilistic trajectory generation. We name our method Mixed Gaussian Flow (MGF).

Current video-based hand pose reconstruction methods primarily focus on improving frame-wise 3D pose using adjacent frames rather than studying consistent 4D hand trajectories in space. Despite the additional temporal cues, they generally underperform compared to image-based methods due to the scarcity of annotated video data. To address these issues, we repurpose a state-of-the-art image-based transformer to take in multiple frames and directly predict a coherent trajectory. We introduce two types of lightweight attention layers: cross-view self-attention to fuse temporal information, and global cross-attention to bring in larger spatial context. Our method infers 4D hand trajectories similar to the ground truth while maintaining strong 2D reprojection alignment. We apply the method to both egocentric and allocentric videos. It significantly outperforms existing methods in global trajectory accuracy while being comparable to the state-of-the-art in single-image pose estimation.

| **[Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction Based on Social Interactions Learning With Random Weights](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07711v1)** | 2025-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pedestrian trajectory prediction is a critical technology in the evolution of self-driving cars toward complete artificial intelligence. Over recent years, focusing on the trajectories of pedestrians to model their social interactions has surged with great interest in more accurate trajectory predictions. However, existing methods for modeling pedestrian social interactions rely on pre-defined rules, struggling to capture non-explicit social interactions. In this work, we propose a novel framework named DTGAN, which extends the application of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to graph sequence data, with the primary objective of automatically capturing implicit social interactions and achieving precise predictions of pedestrian trajectory. DTGAN innovatively incorporates random weights within each graph to eliminate the need for pre-defined interaction rules. We further enhance the performance of DTGAN by exploring diverse task loss functions during adversarial training, which yields improvements of 16.7\% and 39.3\% on metrics ADE and FDE, respectively. The effectiveness and accuracy of our framework are verified on two public datasets. The experimental results show that our proposed DTGAN achieves superior performance and is well able to understand pedestrians' intentions.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages,7 figures,Accepted to IEEE Transactions on Multimedia (TMM)</p></details> |
| **[Computing Safety Margins of Parameterized Nonlinear Systems for Vulnerability Assessment via Trajectory Sensitivities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07498v1)** | 2025-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Physical systems experience nonlinear disturbances which have the potential to disrupt desired behavior. For a particular disturbance, whether or not the system recovers from the disturbance to a desired stable equilibrium point depends on system parameter values, which are typically uncertain and time-varying. Therefore, to quantify proximity to vulnerability we define the safety margin to be the smallest change in parameter values from a nominal value such that the system will no longer be able to recover from the disturbance. Safety margins are valuable but challenging to compute as related methods, such as those for robust region of attraction estimation, are often either overly conservative or computationally intractable for high dimensional systems. Recently, we developed algorithms to compute safety margins efficiently and non-conservatively by exploiting the large sensitivity of the system trajectory near the region of attraction boundary to small perturbations. Although these algorithms have enjoyed empirical success, they lack theoretical guarantees that would ensure their generalizability. This work develops a novel characterization of safety margins in terms of trajectory sensitivities, and uses this to derive well-posedness and convergence guarantees for these algorithms, enabling their generalizability and successful application to a large class of nonlinear systems.</p></details> | 16 pages |
| **[Global Search for Optimal Low Thrust Spacecraft Trajectories using Diffusion Models and the Indirect Method](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07005v1)** | 2025-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Long time-duration low-thrust nonlinear optimal spacecraft trajectory global search is a computationally and time expensive problem characterized by clustering patterns in locally optimal solutions. During preliminary mission design, mission parameters are subject to frequent changes, necessitating that trajectory designers efficiently generate high-quality control solutions for these new scenarios. Generative machine learning models can be trained to learn how the solution structure varies with respect to a conditional parameter, thereby accelerating the global search for missions with updated parameters. In this work, state-of-the-art diffusion models are integrated with the indirect approach for trajectory optimization within a global search framework. This framework is tested on two low-thrust transfers of different complexity in the circular restricted three-body problem. By generating and analyzing a training data set, we develop mathematical relations and techniques to understand the complex structures in the costate domain of locally optimal solutions for these problems. A diffusion model is trained on this data and successfully accelerates the global search for both problems. The model predicts how the costate solution structure changes, based on the maximum spacecraft thrust magnitude. Warm-starting a numerical solver with diffusion model samples for the costates at the initial time increases the number of solutions generated per minute for problems with unseen thrust magnitudes by one to two orders of magnitude in comparison to samples from a uniform distribution and from an adjoint control transformation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Estimation of Relaxed Model Parameters for Robust UAV Trajectory Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10941v2)** | 2025-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Online trajectory optimization and optimal control methods are crucial for enabling sustainable unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) services, such as agriculture, environmental monitoring, and transportation, where available actuation and energy are limited. However, optimal controllers are highly sensitive to model mismatch, which can occur due to loaded equipment, packages to be delivered, or pre-existing variability in fundamental structural and thrust-related parameters. To circumvent this problem, optimal controllers can be paired with parameter estimators to improve their trajectory planning performance and perform adaptive control. However, UAV platforms are limited in terms of onboard processing power, oftentimes making nonlinear parameter estimation too computationally expensive to consider. To address these issues, we propose a relaxed, affine-in-parameters multirotor model along with an efficient optimal parameter estimator. We convexify the nominal Moving Horizon Parameter Estimation (MHPE) problem into a linear-quadratic form (LQ-MHPE) via an affine-in-parameter relaxation on the nonlinear dynamics, resulting in fast quadratic programs (QPs) that facilitate adaptive Model Predictve Control (MPC) in real time. We compare this approach to the equivalent nonlinear estimator in Monte Carlo simulations, demonstrating a decrease in average solve time and trajectory optimality cost by 98.2% and 23.9-56.2%, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures, to be published in IEEE Sustech 2025</p></details> |

While promising approaches exist, they often revolve around pedestrian datasets excluding traffic-related information, or resemble architectures that are either not real-time capable or robust. To address these limitations, we first introduce a dedicated benchmark based on Argoverse 2, specifically targeting pedestrians in traffic environments. Following this, we present Snapshot, a modular, feed-forward neural network that outperforms the current state of the art, reducing the Average Displacement Error (ADE) by 8.8% while utilizing significantly less information. Despite its agent-centric encoding scheme, Snapshot demonstrates scalability, real-time performance, and robustness to varying motion histories. Moreover, by integrating Snapshot into a modular autonomous driving software stack, we showcase its real-world applicability.</p></details> | 8 Pages, 9 Figures |
| **[Pitch Plane Trajectory Tracking Control for Sounding Rockets via Adaptive Feedback Linearization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05285v1)** | 2025-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper proposes a pitch plane trajectory tacking control solution for suborbital launch vehicles relying on adaptive feedback linearization. Initially, the 2D dynamics and kinematics for a single-engine, thrust-vector-controlled sounding rocket are obtained for control design purposes. Then, an inner-outer control strategy, which simultaneously tackles attitude and position control, is adopted, with the inner-loop comprising the altitude and pitch control and the outer-loop addressing the horizontal (downrange) position control. Feedback linearization is used to cancel out the non-linearities in both the inner and outer dynamics. Making use of Lyapunov stability theory, an adaptation law, which provides online estimates on the inner-loop aerodynamic uncertainty, is jointly designed with the output tracking controller via adaptive backstepping, ensuring global reference tracking in the region where the feedback linearization is well-defined. The zero dynamics of the inner-stabilized system are then exploited to obtain the outerloop dynamics and derive a Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) with integral action, which can stabilize them as well as reject external disturbances. In the outermost loop, the estimate on the correspondent aerodynamic uncertainty is indirectly obtained by using the inner loop estimates together with known aerodynamics relations. The resulting inner-outer position control solution is proven to be asymptotically stable in the region of interest. Using a single-stage sounding rocket, propelled by a liquid engine, as reference vehicle, different mission scenarios are tested in a simulation environment to verify the adaptability of the proposed control strategy. The system is able to track the requested trajectories while rejecting external wind disturbances. Furthermore, the need to re-tune the control gains in between different mission scenarios is minimal to none.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper accepted to the IEEE Aerospace Conference 2025.

It is often due to limitations like complex architectures customized for a specific dataset and inefficient multimodal handling. We propose Perceiver with Register queries (PerReg+), a novel trajectory prediction framework that introduces: (1) Dual-Level Representation Learning via Self-Distillation (SD) and Masked Reconstruction (MR), capturing global context and fine-grained details. Additionally, our approach of reconstructing segmentlevel trajectories and lane segments from masked inputs with query drop, enables effective use of contextual information and improves generalization; (2) Enhanced Multimodality using register-based queries and pretraining, eliminating the need for clustering and suppression; and (3) Adaptive Prompt Tuning during fine-tuning, freezing the main architecture and optimizing a small number of prompts for efficient adaptation. PerReg+ sets a new state-of-the-art performance on nuScenes [1], Argoverse 2 [2], and Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD) [3]. Remarkable, our pretrained model reduces the error by 6.8% on smaller datasets, and multi-dataset training enhances generalization. In cross-domain tests, PerReg+ reduces B-FDE by 11.8% compared to its non-pretrained variant.</p></details> |  |

While recent methods based on the motion manifold hypothesis, which assumes that a set of trajectories lies on a lower-dimensional nonlinear subspace, address challenges such as limited dataset size and the high dimensionality of trajectory data, they often struggle to capture complex task-motion dependencies, i.e., when motion distributions shift drastically with task variations. To address this, we introduce Motion Manifold Flow Primitives (MMFP), a framework that decouples the training of the motion manifold from task-conditioned distributions. Specifically, we employ flow matching models, state-of-the-art conditional deep generative models, to learn task-conditioned distributions in the latent coordinate space of the learned motion manifold. Experiments are conducted on language-guided trajectory generation tasks, where many-to-many text-motion correspondences introduce complex task-motion dependencies, highlighting MMFP's superiority over existing methods.</p></details> | 8 pages, 11 figures |

In this task, the model is required to make predictions based on natural language instructions, egocentric view images before manipulation, and the given end-effector trajectories. Conventional methods typically perform success prediction only after the manipulation is executed, limiting their efficiency in executing the entire task sequence. We propose a novel approach that enables the prediction of success or failure by aligning the given trajectories and images with natural language instructions. We introduce Trajectory Encoder to apply learnable weighting to the input trajectories, allowing the model to consider temporal dynamics and interactions between objects and the end effector, improving the model's ability to predict manipulation outcomes accurately. We constructed a dataset based on the RT-1 dataset, a large-scale benchmark for open-vocabulary object manipulation tasks, to evaluate our method. The experimental results show that our method achieved a higher prediction accuracy than baseline approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for presentation at LangRob @ CoRL 2024</p></details> |
| **[Frenet-Serret-Based Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04273v1)** | 2025-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction is a crucial element of guidance, navigation, and control systems. This paper presents two novel trajectory-prediction methods based on real-time position measurements and adaptive input and state estimation (AISE). The first method, called AISE/va, uses position measurements to estimate the target velocity and acceleration. The second method, called AISE/FS, models the target trajectory as a 3D curve using the Frenet-Serret formulas, which require estimates of velocity, acceleration, and jerk. To estimate velocity, acceleration, and jerk in real time, AISE computes first, second, and third derivatives of the position measurements. AISE does not rely on assumptions about the target maneuver, measurement noise, or disturbances. For trajectory prediction, both methods use measurements of the target position and estimates of its derivatives to extrapolate from the current position. The performance of AISE/va and AISE/FS is compared numerically with the $\alpha$-$\beta$-$\gamma$ filter, which shows that AISE/FS provides more accurate trajectory prediction than AISE/va and traditional methods, especially for complex target maneuvers.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 6 figures.

However, predictive modeling of such data remains challenging due to high dimensionality, irregular sampling, and data sparsity. To address these issues, we propose ImageFlowNet, a novel model designed to forecast disease trajectories from initial images while preserving spatial details. ImageFlowNet first learns multiscale joint representation spaces across patients and time points, then optimizes deterministic or stochastic flow fields within these spaces using a position-parameterized neural ODE/SDE framework. The model leverages a UNet architecture to create robust multiscale representations and mitigates data scarcity by combining knowledge from all patients. We provide theoretical insights that support our formulation of ODEs, and motivate our regularizations involving high-level visual features, latent space organization, and trajectory smoothness. We validate ImageFlowNet on three longitudinal medical image datasets depicting progression in geographic atrophy, multiple sclerosis, and glioblastoma, demonstrating its ability to effectively forecast disease progression and outperform existing methods. Our contributions include the development of ImageFlowNet, its theoretical underpinnings, and empirical validation on real-world datasets.

These forecasts allow us to anticipate events that lead to collisions and, therefore, to mitigate them. Deep Neural Networks have excelled in motion forecasting, but overconfidence and weak uncertainty quantification persist. Deep Ensembles address these concerns, yet applying them to multimodal distributions remains challenging. In this paper, we propose a novel approach named Hierarchical Light Transformer Ensembles (HLT-Ens) aimed at efficiently training an ensemble of Transformer architectures using a novel hierarchical loss function. HLT-Ens leverages grouped fully connected layers, inspired by grouped convolution techniques, to capture multimodal distributions effectively. We demonstrate that HLT-Ens achieves state-of-the-art performance levels through extensive experimentation, offering a promising avenue for improving trajectory forecasting techniques.</p></details> | WACV 2025 |
| **[Hybrid Machine Learning Model with a Constrained Action Space for Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03666v1)** | 2025-01-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction is crucial to advance autonomous driving, improving safety, and efficiency. Although end-to-end models based on deep learning have great potential, they often do not consider vehicle dynamic limitations, leading to unrealistic predictions. To address this problem, this work introduces a novel hybrid model that combines deep learning with a kinematic motion model. It is able to predict object attributes such as acceleration and yaw rate and generate trajectories based on them. A key contribution is the incorporation of expert knowledge into the learning objective of the deep learning model. This results in the constraint of the available action space, thus enabling the prediction of physically feasible object attributes and trajectories, thereby increasing safety and robustness. The proposed hybrid model facilitates enhanced interpretability, thereby reinforcing the trustworthiness of deep learning methods and promoting the development of safe planning solutions. Experiments conducted on the publicly available real-world Argoverse dataset demonstrate realistic driving behaviour, with benchmark comparisons and ablation studies showing promising results.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to 2025 IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV)</p></details> |
| **[Collision Risk Quantification and Conflict Resolution in Trajectory Tracking for Acceleration-Actuated Multi-Robot Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03585v1)** | 2025-01-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>One of the pivotal challenges in a multi-robot system is how to give attention to accuracy and efficiency while ensuring safety. Prior arts cannot strictly guarantee collision-free for an arbitrarily large number of robots or the results are considerably conservative. Smoothness of the avoidance trajectory also needs to be further optimized. This paper proposes an accelerationactuated simultaneous obstacle avoidance and trajectory tracking method for arbitrarily large teams of robots, that provides a nonconservative collision avoidance strategy and gives approaches for deadlock avoidance. We propose two ways of deadlock resolution, one involves incorporating an auxiliary velocity vector into the error function of the trajectory tracking module, which is proven to have no influence on global convergence of the tracking error. Furthermore, unlike the traditional methods that they address conflicts after a deadlock occurs, our decision-making mechanism avoids the near-zero velocity, which is much more safer and efficient in crowed environments. Extensive comparison show that the proposed method is superior to the existing studies when deployed in a large-scale robot system, with minimal invasiveness.</p></details> |  |
| **[Modeling Cell Type Developmental Trajectory using Multinomial Unbalanced Optimal Transport](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03501v1)** | 2025-01-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Single-cell trajectory analysis aims to reconstruct the biological developmental processes of cells as they evolve over time, leveraging temporal correlations in gene expression. During cellular development, gene expression patterns typically change and vary across different cell types. A significant challenge in this analysis is that RNA sequencing destroys the cell, making it impossible to track gene expression across multiple stages for the same cell. Recent advances have introduced the use of optimal transport tools to model the trajectory of individual cells. In this paper, our focus shifts to a question of greater practical importance: we examine the differentiation of cell types over time. Specifically, we propose a novel method based on discrete unbalanced optimal transport to model the developmental trajectory of cell types. Our method detects biological changes in cell types and infers their transitions to different states by analyzing the transport matrix. We validated our method using single-cell RNA sequencing data from mouse embryonic fibroblasts. The results accurately identified major developmental changes in cell types, which were corroborated by experimental evidence. Furthermore, the inferred transition probabilities between cell types are highly congruent to biological ground truth.</p></details> |  |

Conventional multidisciplinary analysis and optimization (MDAO) can be expensive, while surrogate-based optimization can struggle with challenging physical constraints. This work proposes physics-constrained generative adversarial networks (physicsGAN), to intelligently parameterize the takeoff control profiles of an eVTOL aircraft and to transform the original design space to a feasible space. Specifically, the transformed feasible space refers to a space where all designs directly satisfy all design constraints. The physicsGAN-enabled surrogate-based takeoff trajectory design framework was demonstrated on the Airbus A3 Vahana. The physicsGAN generated only feasible control profiles of power and wing angle in the feasible space with around 98.9% of designs satisfying all constraints. The proposed design framework obtained 99.6% accuracy compared with simulation-based optimal design and took only 2.2 seconds, which reduced the computational time by around 200 times. Meanwhile, data-driven GAN-enabled surrogate-based optimization took 21.9 seconds using a derivative-free optimizer, which was around an order of magnitude slower than the proposed framework. Moreover, the data-driven GAN-based optimization using gradient-based optimizers could not consistently find the optimal design during random trials and got stuck in an infeasible region, which is problematic in real practice. Therefore, the proposed physicsGAN-based design framework outperformed data-driven GAN-based design to the extent of efficiency (2.2 seconds), optimality (99.6% accurate), and feasibility (100% feasible). According to the literature review, this is the first physics-constrained generative artificial intelligence enabled by surrogate models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Confe...</summary><p>Conference version with 10 pages and 7 figures</p></details> |

While recent advancements produce photorealistic outputs, they frequently struggle to create videos with accurate and consistent object motion, especially in multi-object scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose a two-stage compositional framework that decomposes I2V generation into: (i) An explicit intermediate representation generation stage, followed by (ii) A video generation stage that is conditioned on this representation. Our key innovation is the introduction of a mask-based motion trajectory as an intermediate representation, that captures both semantic object information and motion, enabling an expressive but compact representation of motion and semantics. To incorporate the learned representation in the second stage, we utilize object-level attention objectives. Specifically, we consider a spatial, per-object, masked-cross attention objective, integrating object-specific prompts into corresponding latent space regions and a masked spatio-temporal self-attention objective, ensuring frame-to-frame consistency for each object. We evaluate our method on challenging benchmarks with multi-object and high-motion scenarios and empirically demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results in temporal coherence, motion realism, and text-prompt faithfulness. Additionally, we introduce \benchmark, a new challenging benchmark for single-object and multi-object I2V generation, and demonstrate our method's superiority on this benchmark.

| **[Generating Counterfactual Trajectories with Latent Diffusion Models for Concept Discovery](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10356v2)** | 2025-01-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trustworthiness is a major prerequisite for the safe application of opaque deep learning models in high-stakes domains like medicine. Understanding the decision-making process not only contributes to fostering trust but might also reveal previously unknown decision criteria of complex models that could advance the state of medical research. The discovery of decision-relevant concepts from black box models is a particularly challenging task. This study proposes Concept Discovery through Latent Diffusion-based Counterfactual Trajectories (CDCT), a novel three-step framework for concept discovery leveraging the superior image synthesis capabilities of diffusion models. In the first step, CDCT uses a Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) to generate a counterfactual trajectory dataset. This dataset is used to derive a disentangled representation of classification-relevant concepts using a Variational Autoencoder (VAE). Finally, a search algorithm is applied to identify relevant concepts in the disentangled latent space. The application of CDCT to a classifier trained on the largest public skin lesion dataset revealed not only the presence of several biases but also meaningful biomarkers. Moreover, the counterfactuals generated within CDCT show better FID scores than those produced by a previously established state-of-the-art method, while being 12 times more resource-efficient. Unsupervised concept discovery holds great potential for the application of trustworthy AI and the further development of human knowledge in various domains. CDCT represents a further step in this direction.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at International Conference on Pattern Recognition (ICPR) 2024</p></details> |

However, existing trajectory generation methods often focus on improving trajectory generation quality from a singular perspective, lacking a comprehensive semantic understanding across various scales. Consequently, we are inspired to develop a HOlistic SEmantic Representation (HOSER) framework for navigational trajectory generation. Given an origin-and-destination (OD) pair and the starting time point of a latent trajectory, we first propose a Road Network Encoder to expand the receptive field of road- and zone-level semantics. Second, we design a Multi-Granularity Trajectory Encoder to integrate the spatio-temporal semantics of the generated trajectory at both the point and trajectory levels. Finally, we employ a Destination-Oriented Navigator to seamlessly integrate destination-oriented guidance. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that HOSER outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by a significant margin. Moreover, the model's performance in few-shot learning and zero-shot learning scenarios further verifies the effectiveness of our holistic semantic representation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2025</p></details> |

However, the majority of existing trajectory prediction models have neither considered reducing the uncertainty as one objective during the training stage nor provided reliable uncertainty quantification during inference stage under potential distribution shift. Therefore, in this paper, we propose the Conformal Uncertainty Quantification under Distribution Shift framework, CUQDS, to quantify the uncertainty of the predicted trajectories of existing trajectory prediction models under potential data distribution shift, while considering improving the prediction accuracy of the models and reducing the estimated uncertainty during the training stage. Specifically, CUQDS includes 1) a learning-based Gaussian process regression module that models the output distribution of the base model (any existing trajectory prediction or time series forecasting neural networks) and reduces the estimated uncertainty by additional loss term, and 2) a statistical-based Conformal P control module to calibrate the estimated uncertainty from the Gaussian process regression module in an online setting under potential distribution shift between training and testing data.</p></details> | 9 pages, 2 figures |

The solution is a binary classification that classifies ship trajectories into either fishing or non-fishing ships. The data used are characterized by the typical problems found in classic data mining applications using real-world data, such as noise and inconsistencies. The two classes are also clearly unbalanced in the data, a problem which is addressed using algorithms that resample the instances. For classification, a series of features are extracted from spatiotemporal data that represent the trajectories of the ships, available from sequences of Automatic Identification System (AIS) reports. These features are proposed for the modelling of ship behavior but, because they do not contain context-related information, the classification can be applied in other scenarios. Experimentation shows that the proposed data preparation process is useful for the presented classification problem. In addition, positive results are obtained using minimal information.</p></details> | Sensors 2020 |
| **[Enhancing Large Vision Model in Street Scene Semantic Understanding through Leveraging Posterior Optimization Trajectory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01710v1)** | 2025-01-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To improve the generalization of the autonomous driving (AD) perception model, vehicles need to update the model over time based on the continuously collected data. As time progresses, the amount of data fitted by the AD model expands, which helps to improve the AD model generalization substantially. However, such ever-expanding data is a double-edged sword for the AD model. Specifically, as the fitted data volume grows to exceed the the AD model's fitting capacities, the AD model is prone to under-fitting. To address this issue, we propose to use a pretrained Large Vision Models (LVMs) as backbone coupled with downstream perception head to understand AD semantic information. This design can not only surmount the aforementioned under-fitting problem due to LVMs' powerful fitting capabilities, but also enhance the perception generalization thanks to LVMs' vast and diverse training data. On the other hand, to mitigate vehicles' computational burden of training the perception head while running LVM backbone, we introduce a Posterior Optimization Trajectory (POT)-Guided optimization scheme (POTGui) to accelerate the convergence. Concretely, we propose a POT Generator (POTGen) to generate posterior (future) optimization direction in advance to guide the current optimization iteration, through which the model can generally converge within 10 epochs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method improves the performance by over 66.48\% and converges faster over 6 times, compared to the existing state-of-the-art approach.</p></details> | 7 pages |
| **[Trajectory Representation Learning on Road Networks and Grids with Spatio-Temporal Dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14014v2)** | 2025-01-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory representation learning is a fundamental task for applications in fields including smart city, and urban planning, as it facilitates the utilization of trajectory data (e.g., vehicle movements) for various downstream applications, such as trajectory similarity computation or travel time estimation. This is achieved by learning low-dimensional representations from high-dimensional and raw trajectory data. However, existing methods for trajectory representation learning either rely on grid-based or road-based representations, which are inherently different and thus, could lose information contained in the other modality. Moreover, these methods overlook the dynamic nature of urban traffic, relying on static road network features rather than time varying traffic patterns. In this paper, we propose TIGR, a novel model designed to integrate grid and road network modalities while incorporating spatio-temporal dynamics to learn rich, general-purpose representations of trajectories. We evaluate TIGR on two realworld datasets and demonstrate the effectiveness of combining both modalities by substantially outperforming state-of-the-art methods, i.e., up to 43.22% for trajectory similarity, up to 16.65% for travel time estimation, and up to 10.16% for destination prediction.</p></details> |  |

However, generating factually consistent responses in knowledge-intensive scenarios remains a challenge due to issues such as hallucination, difficulty in acquiring long-tailed knowledge, and limited memory expansion. This paper introduces SMART, a novel multi-agent framework that leverages external knowledge to enhance the interpretability and factual consistency of LLM-generated responses. SMART comprises four specialized agents, each performing a specific sub-trajectory action to navigate complex knowledge-intensive tasks. We propose a multi-agent co-training paradigm, Long-Short Trajectory Learning, which ensures synergistic collaboration among agents while maintaining fine-grained execution by each agent. Extensive experiments on five knowledge-intensive tasks demonstrate SMART's superior performance compared to widely adopted knowledge internalization and knowledge enhancement methods. Our framework can extend beyond knowledge-intensive tasks to more complex scenarios. Our code is available at https://github.com/yueshengbin/SMART.</p></details> | Accepted by AAAI2025 |

However, a key shortcoming in current machine learning-based methods for trajectory generation is that they require large datasets and even small changes to the original trajectory design requirements necessitate retraining new models to learn the parameter-to-solution mapping. In this work, we leverage compositional diffusion modeling to efficiently adapt out-of-distribution data and problem variations in a few-shot framework for 6 degree-of-freedom (DoF) powered descent trajectory generation. Unlike traditional deep learning methods that can only learn the underlying structure of one specific trajectory optimization problem, diffusion models are a powerful generative modeling framework that represents the solution as a probability density function (PDF) and this allows for the composition of PDFs encompassing a variety of trajectory design specifications and constraints. We demonstrate the capability of compositional diffusion models for inference-time 6 DoF minimum-fuel landing site selection and composable constraint representations.

Though this technology plays a significant role in alleviating the prevalent operational difficulties in logistics and transportation systems, the precise prediction of vehicle trajectories still poses a substantial challenge. To address this, our study introduces the Spatio Temporal Attention-based methodology for Target Vehicle Trajectory Prediction (STATVTPred). This approach integrates Global Positioning System(GPS) localization technology to track target movement and dynamically predict the vehicle's future path using comprehensive spatio-temporal trajectory data. We map the vehicle trajectory onto a directed graph, after which spatial attributes are extracted via a Graph Attention Networks(GATs). The Transformer technology is employed to yield temporal features from the sequence. These elements are then amalgamated with local road network structure maps to filter and deliver a smooth trajectory sequence, resulting in precise vehicle trajectory prediction.This study validates our proposed STATVTPred method on T-Drive and Chengdu taxi-trajectory datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that STATVTPred achieves 6.38% and 10.55% higher Average Match Rate (AMR) than the Transformer model on the Beijing and Chengdu datasets, respectively. Compared to the LSTM Encoder-Decoder model, STATVTPred boosts AMR by 37.45% and 36.06% on the same datasets. This is expected to establish STATVTPred as a new approach for handling trajectory prediction of targets in logistics and transportation scenarios, thereby enhancing prediction accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trajectories of Change: Approaches for Tracking Knowledge Evolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00391v1)** | 2024-12-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We explore local vs. global evolution of knowledge systems through the framework of socio-epistemic networks (SEN), applying two complementary methods to a corpus of scientific texts. The framework comprises three interconnected layers-social, semiotic (material), and semantic-proposing a multilayered approach to understanding structural developments of knowledge. To analyse diachronic changes on the semantic layer, we first use information-theoretic measures based on relative entropy to detect semantic shifts, assess their significance, and identify key driving features. Second, variations in document embedding densities reveal changes in semantic neighbourhoods, tracking how concentration of similar documents increase, remain stable, or disperse. This enables us to trace document trajectories based on content (topics) or metadata (authorship, institution). Case studies of Joseph Silk and Hans-J\"urgen Treder illustrate how individual scholar's work aligns with broader disciplinary shifts in general relativity and gravitation research, demonstrating the applications, limitations, and further potential of this approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[TrajLearn: Trajectory Prediction Learning using Deep Generative Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00184v1)** | 2024-12-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction aims to estimate an entity's future path using its current position and historical movement data, benefiting fields like autonomous navigation, robotics, and human movement analytics. Deep learning approaches have become key in this area, utilizing large-scale trajectory datasets to model movement patterns, but face challenges in managing complex spatial dependencies and adapting to dynamic environments. To address these challenges, we introduce TrajLearn, a novel model for trajectory prediction that leverages generative modeling of higher-order mobility flows based on hexagonal spatial representation. TrajLearn predicts the next $k$ steps by integrating a customized beam search for exploring multiple potential paths while maintaining spatial continuity. We conducted a rigorous evaluation of TrajLearn, benchmarking it against leading state-of-the-art approaches and meaningful baselines. The results indicate that TrajLearn achieves significant performance gains, with improvements of up to ~40% across multiple real-world trajectory datasets. In addition, we evaluated different prediction horizons (i.e., various values of $k$), conducted resolution sensitivity analysis, and performed ablation studies to assess the impact of key model components. Furthermore, we developed a novel algorithm to generate mixed-resolution maps by hierarchically subdividing hexagonal regions into finer segments within a specified observation area. This approach supports selective detailing, applying finer resolution to areas of interest or high activity (e.g., urban centers) while using coarser resolution for less significant regions (e.g., rural areas), effectively reducing data storage requirements and computational overhead. We promote reproducibility and adaptability by offering complete code, data, and detailed documentation with flexible configuration options for various applications.</p></details> |  |

Most modern trajectory planning techniques rely on numerical optimization because high-quality, expressive trajectories that satisfy various constraints can be systematically computed. However, meeting computation time constraints and the potential for numerical instabilities can limit the use of optimization-based planners in safety-critical scenarios. This work presents an optimization-free planning framework that stitches short trajectory segments together with graph search to compute long range, expressive, and near-optimal trajectories in real-time. Our STITCHER algorithm is shown to outperform modern optimization-based planners through our innovative planning architecture and several algorithmic developments that make real-time planning possible. Extensive simulation testing is conducted to analyze the algorithmic components that make up STITCHER, and a thorough comparison with two state-of-the-art optimization planners is performed. It is shown STITCHER can generate trajectories through complex environments over long distances (tens of meters) with low computation times (milliseconds).</p></details> | V1 Draft |

Trajectory prediction spans both short-term and long-term horizons, each requiring distinct considerations: short-term predictions rely on accurately capturing the vehicle's dynamics, while long-term predictions rely on accurately modeling the interaction patterns within the environment. However current approaches, either physics-based or learning-based models, always ignore these distinct considerations, making them struggle to find the optimal prediction for both short-term and long-term horizon. In this paper, we introduce the Dynamics-Enhanced Learning MOdel (DEMO), a novel approach that combines a physics-based Vehicle Dynamics Model with advanced deep learning algorithms. DEMO employs a two-stage architecture, featuring a Dynamics Learning Stage and an Interaction Learning Stage, where the former stage focuses on capturing vehicle motion dynamics and the latter focuses on modeling interaction. By capitalizing on the respective strengths of both methods, DEMO facilitates multi-horizon predictions for future trajectories. Experimental results on the Next Generation Simulation (NGSIM), Macau Connected Autonomous Driving (MoCAD), Highway Drone (HighD), and nuScenes datasets demonstrate that DEMO outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines in both short-term and long-term prediction horizons.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Information Fusion</p></details> |

However, EEG source imaging (ESI) based kinematics prediction is sparsely explored in the literature. In this study, pre-movement EEG features are utilized to predict three-dimensional (3D) hand kinematics for the grasp-and-lift motor task. A public dataset, WAY-EEG-GAL, is utilized for MKP analysis. In particular, sensor-domain (EEG data) and source-domain (ESI data) based features from the frontoparietal region are explored for MKP. Deep learning-based models are explored to achieve efficient kinematics decoding. Various time-lagged and window sizes are analyzed for hand kinematics prediction. Subsequently, intra-subject and inter-subject MKP analysis is performed to investigate the subject-specific and subject-independent motor-learning capabilities of the neural decoders. The Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) is used as the performance metric for kinematics trajectory decoding. The rEEGNet neural decoder achieved the best performance with sensor-domain and source-domain features with a time lag and window size of 100 ms and 450 ms, respectively. The highest mean PCC values of 0.790, 0.795, and 0.637 are achieved using sensor-domain features, while 0.769, 0.777, and 0.647 are achieved using source-domain features in x, y, and z-directions, respectively. This study explores the feasibility of trajectory prediction using EEG sensor-domain and source-domain EEG features for the grasp-and-lift task. Furthermore, inter-subject trajectory estimation is performed using the proposed deep learning decoder with EEG source domain features.</p></details> |  |

This paper explores two global search problems in the circular restricted three-body problem: hybrid cost function of minimum fuel/time-of-flight and transfers to energy-dependent invariant manifolds. These problems display a fundamental structure either in the optimal control profile or the use of dynamical structures.

In particular, reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promise in the synthesis of controllers for systems with complex dynamics and modest online compute budgets. However, the poor sample efficiency of RL and the challenges of reward design make training slow and sometimes unstable, especially for high-dimensional systems. In this work, we leverage the inherent Lie group symmetries of robotic systems with a floating base to mitigate these challenges when learning tracking controllers. We model a general tracking problem as a Markov decision process (MDP) that captures the evolution of both the physical and reference states. Next, we prove that symmetry in the underlying dynamics and running costs leads to an MDP homomorphism, a mapping that allows a policy trained on a lower-dimensional "quotient" MDP to be lifted to an optimal tracking controller for the original system. We compare this symmetry-informed approach to an unstructured baseline, using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to learn tracking controllers for three systems: the Particle (a forced point mass), the Astrobee (a fully-actuated space robot), and the Quadrotor (an underactuated system). Results show that a symmetry-aware approach both accelerates training and reduces tracking error after the same number of training steps.</p></details> | <details><summary>The f...</summary><p>The first three authors contributed equally to this work.

In the case of numerical solution, it is dependent on the original optimal control problem, the choice of a control transcription, and the behavior of a gradient based numerical solver. In this paper we formulate the parameterized global search problem as the task of sampling a conditional probability distribution with support on the neighborhoods of local basins of attraction to the high quality solutions. The conditional distribution is learned and represented using deep generative models that allow for prediction of how the local basins change as parameters vary. The approach is benchmarked on a low thrust spacecraft trajectory optimization problem in the circular restricted three-body problem, showing significant speed-up over a simple multi-start method and vanilla machine learning approaches. The paper also provides an in-depth analysis of the multi-modal funnel structure of a low-thrust spacecraft trajectory optimization problem.</p></details> | <details><summary>47 pa...</summary><p>47 pages, 23 figures, initial content of this paper appears in Paper 23-352 at the AAS/AIAA Astrodynamics Specialist Conference, Big Sky, MT, August 13-17 2023</p></details> |

Facing the dual eavesdropping threats, we aim to enhance the average achievable secrecy rate for the communication user by jointly designing the UAV trajectory together with the transmit information and sensing beamforming, while satisfying the requirements on sensing performance and sensing security, as well as the UAV power and flight constraints. To address the non-convex nature of the optimization problem, we employ the alternating optimization (AO) strategy, jointly with the successive convex approximation (SCA) and semidefinite relaxation (SDR) methods. Numerical results validate the proposed approach, demonstrating its ability to achieve a high secrecy rate while meeting the required sensing and security constraints.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 6 figures, submitted for possible publication</p></details> |

Despite their utility in advancing digital automation, a critical bottleneck persists: collecting high-quality trajectory data for training. Common practices for collecting such data rely on human supervision or synthetic data generation through executing pre-defined tasks, which are either resource-intensive or unable to guarantee data quality. Moreover, these methods suffer from limited data diversity and significant gaps between synthetic data and real-world environments. To address these challenges, we propose OS-Genesis, a novel GUI data synthesis pipeline that reverses the conventional trajectory collection process. Instead of relying on pre-defined tasks, OS-Genesis enables agents first to perceive environments and perform step-wise interactions, then retrospectively derive high-quality tasks to enable trajectory-level exploration. A trajectory reward model is then employed to ensure the quality of the generated trajectories. We demonstrate that training GUI agents with OS-Genesis significantly improves their performance on highly challenging online benchmarks. In-depth analysis further validates OS-Genesis's efficiency and its superior data quality and diversity compared to existing synthesis methods. Our codes, data, and checkpoints are available at \href{https://qiushisun.github.io/OS-Genesis-Home/}{OS-Genesis Homepage}.</p></details> | Work in progress |
| **[A data driven approach to classify descriptors based on their efficiency in translating noisy trajectories into physically-relevant information](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12570v3)** | 2024-12-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reconstructing the physical complexity of many-body dynamical systems can be challenging. Starting from the trajectories of their constitutive units (raw data), typical approaches require selecting appropriate descriptors to convert them into time-series, which are then analyzed to extract interpretable information. However, identifying the most effective descriptor is often non-trivial. Here, we report a data-driven approach to compare the efficiency of various descriptors in extracting information from noisy trajectories and translating it into physically relevant insights. As a prototypical system with non-trivial internal complexity, we analyze molecular dynamics trajectories of an atomistic system where ice and water coexist in equilibrium near the solid/liquid transition temperature. We compare general and specific descriptors often used in aqueous systems: number of neighbors, molecular velocities, Smooth Overlap of Atomic Positions (SOAP), Local Environments and Neighbors Shuffling (LENS), Orientational Tetrahedral Order, and distance from the fifth neighbor ($d_5$). Using Onion Clustering -- an efficient unsupervised method for single-point time-series analysis -- we assess the maximum extractable information for each descriptor and rank them via a high-dimensional metric. Our results show that advanced descriptors like SOAP and LENS outperform classical ones due to higher signal-to-noise ratios. Nonetheless, even simple descriptors can rival or exceed advanced ones after local signal denoising. For example, $d_5$, initially among the weakest, becomes the most effective at resolving the system's non-local dynamical complexity after denoising. This work highlights the critical role of noise in information extraction from molecular trajectories and offers a data-driven approach to identify optimal descriptors for systems with characteristic internal complexity.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 5 figures + 3 in supporting information (at the bottom of the manuscript)</p></details> |
| **[TrajGEOS: Trajectory Graph Enhanced Orientation-based Sequential Network for Mobility Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19092v1)** | 2024-12-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human mobility studies how people move to access their needed resources and plays a significant role in urban planning and location-based services. As a paramount task of human mobility modeling, next location prediction is challenging because of the diversity of users' historical trajectories that gives rise to complex mobility patterns and various contexts. Deep sequential models have been widely used to predict the next location by leveraging the inherent sequentiality of trajectory data. However, they do not fully leverage the relationship between locations and fail to capture users' multi-level preferences. This work constructs a trajectory graph from users' historical traces and proposes a \textbf{Traj}ectory \textbf{G}raph \textbf{E}nhanced \textbf{O}rientation-based \textbf{S}equential network (TrajGEOS) for next-location prediction tasks. TrajGEOS introduces hierarchical graph convolution to capture location and user embeddings. Such embeddings consider not only the contextual feature of locations but also the relation between them, and serve as additional features in downstream modules. In addition, we design an orientation-based module to learn users' mid-term preferences from sequential modeling modules and their recent trajectories. Extensive experiments on three real-world LBSN datasets corroborate the value of graph and orientation-based modules and demonstrate that TrajGEOS outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on the next location prediction task.</p></details> |  |

While several CTP methods have been developed for this problem, we posit that none of these methods (1) jointly considers the mutual ternary dependency between three key units (i.e., user, position, and company) of a career and (2) captures the characteristic shifts of key units in career over time, leading to an inaccurate understanding of the job movement patterns in the labor market. To address the above challenges, we propose a novel solution, named as CAPER, that solves the challenges via sophisticated temporal knowledge graph (TKG) modeling. It enables the utilization of a graph-structured knowledge base with rich expressiveness, effectively preserving the changes in job movement patterns. Furthermore, we devise an extrapolated career reasoning task on TKG for a realistic evaluation. The experiments on a real-world career trajectory dataset demonstrate that CAPER consistently and significantly outperforms four baselines, two recent TKG reasoning methods, and five state-of-the-art CTP methods in predicting one's future companies and positions--i.e., on average, yielding 6.80% and 34.58% more accurate predictions, respectively.

| **[Single Trajectory Distillation for Accelerating Image and Video Style Transfer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18945v1)** | 2024-12-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion-based stylization methods typically denoise from a specific partial noise state for image-to-image and video-to-video tasks. This multi-step diffusion process is computationally expensive and hinders real-world application. A promising solution to speed up the process is to obtain few-step consistency models through trajectory distillation. However, current consistency models only force the initial-step alignment between the probability flow ODE (PF-ODE) trajectories of the student and the imperfect teacher models. This training strategy can not ensure the consistency of whole trajectories. To address this issue, we propose single trajectory distillation (STD) starting from a specific partial noise state. We introduce a trajectory bank to store the teacher model's trajectory states, mitigating the time cost during training. Besides, we use an asymmetric adversarial loss to enhance the style and quality of the generated images. Extensive experiments on image and video stylization demonstrate that our method surpasses existing acceleration models in terms of style similarity and aesthetic evaluations. Our code and results will be available on the project page: https://single-trajectory-distillation.github.io.</p></details> |  |
| **[CausalTAD: Causal Implicit Generative Model for Debiased Online Trajectory Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18820v1)** | 2024-12-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory anomaly detection, aiming to estimate the anomaly risk of trajectories given the Source-Destination (SD) pairs, has become a critical problem for many real-world applications. Existing solutions directly train a generative model for observed trajectories and calculate the conditional generative probability $P({T}|{C})$ as the anomaly risk, where ${T}$ and ${C}$ represent the trajectory and SD pair respectively. However, we argue that the observed trajectories are confounded by road network preference which is a common cause of both SD distribution and trajectories. Existing methods ignore this issue limiting their generalization ability on out-of-distribution trajectories. In this paper, we define the debiased trajectory anomaly detection problem and propose a causal implicit generative model, namely CausalTAD, to solve it. CausalTAD adopts do-calculus to eliminate the confounding bias of road network preference and estimates $P({T}|do({C}))$ as the anomaly criterion. Extensive experiments show that CausalTAD can not only achieve superior performance on trained trajectories but also generally improve the performance of out-of-distribution data, with improvements of $2.1\% \sim 5.7\%$ and $10.6\% \sim 32.7\%$ respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICDE 2024</p></details> |

To predict the states of the system, the Holt's exponential smoothing techniques and nonlinear dynamic equations of gas pipelines are applied to establish the power and gas system equations, respectively. The square-root cubature Kalman filter algorithm is utilized to address the numerical challenges posed by the strongly nonlinear system equations. The boundary conditions in the gas system include the flow balances at sink nodes, and the mass flow rates of loads have to be predicted at each computation step. For the prediction of load mass flows, the long short-term memory network is employed, known for its effectiveness in time series prediction. Consequently, a combined method based on the square-root cubature Kalman filter and the long short-term memory network is proposed for tracking integrated gas and power systems. To evaluate the tracking performances of the proposed method, the IEEE-39 bus power system and GasLib-40 node gas system are used to form the testing system. Simulation results demonstrate high precision in tracking the dynamic states of power and gas systems. Two indexes are introduced for a numerical analysis of the tracking results, indicating that the accuracy of this method surpasses that of traditional measurements.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics</p></details> |

Although considerable research efforts have been made recently, the inherent trajectory uncertainty caused by various factors including the dynamic driving intends and the diverse driving scenarios still poses significant challenges to accurate trajectory prediction. To address this issue, we propose C2F-TP, a coarse-to-fine denoising framework for uncertainty-aware vehicle trajectory prediction. C2F-TP features an innovative two-stage coarse-to-fine prediction process. Specifically, in the spatial-temporal interaction stage, we propose a spatial-temporal interaction module to capture the inter-vehicle interactions and learn a multimodal trajectory distribution, from which a certain number of noisy trajectories are sampled. Next, in the trajectory refinement stage, we design a conditional denoising model to reduce the uncertainty of the sampled trajectories through a step-wise denoising operation. Extensive experiments are conducted on two real datasets NGSIM and highD that are widely adopted in trajectory prediction. The result demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposal.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2025</p></details> |
| **[Addressing and Visualizing Misalignments in Human Task-Solving Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14191v2)** | 2024-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The effectiveness of AI model training hinges on the quality of the trajectory data used, particularly in aligning the model's decision with human intentions. However, in the human task-solving trajectories, we observe significant misalignments between human intentions and the recorded trajectories, which can undermine AI model training. This paper addresses the challenges of these misalignments by proposing a visualization tool and a heuristic algorithm designed to detect and categorize discrepancies in trajectory data. Although the heuristic algorithm requires a set of predefined human intentions to function, which we currently cannot extract, the visualization tool offers valuable insights into the nature of these misalignments. We expect that eliminating these misalignments could significantly improve the utility of trajectory data for AI model training. We also propose that future work should focus on developing methods, such as Topic Modeling, to accurately extract human intentions from trajectory data, thereby enhancing the alignment between user actions and AI learning processes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Similarity Trajectories: Linking Sampling Process to Artifacts in Diffusion-Generated Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17109v1)** | 2024-12-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Artifact detection algorithms are crucial to correcting the output generated by diffusion models. However, because of the variety of artifact forms, existing methods require substantial annotated data for training. This requirement limits their scalability and efficiency, which restricts their wide application. This paper shows that the similarity of denoised images between consecutive time steps during the sampling process is related to the severity of artifacts in images generated by diffusion models. Building on this observation, we introduce the concept of Similarity Trajectory to characterize the sampling process and its correlation with the image artifacts presented. Using an annotated data set of 680 images, which is only 0.1% of the amount of data used in the prior work, we trained a classifier on these trajectories to predict the presence of artifacts in images. By performing 10-fold validation testing on the balanced annotated data set, the classifier can achieve an accuracy of 72.35%, highlighting the connection between the Similarity Trajectory and the occurrence of artifacts. This approach enables differentiation between artifact-exhibiting and natural-looking images using limited training data.</p></details> |  |
| **[HyperNet Fields: Efficiently Training Hypernetworks without Ground Truth by Learning Weight Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17040v1)** | 2024-12-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To efficiently adapt large models or to train generative models of neural representations, Hypernetworks have drawn interest. While hypernetworks work well, training them is cumbersome, and often requires ground truth optimized weights for each sample. However, obtaining each of these weights is a training problem of its own-one needs to train, e.g., adaptation weights or even an entire neural field for hypernetworks to regress to. In this work, we propose a method to train hypernetworks, without the need for any per-sample ground truth. Our key idea is to learn a Hypernetwork `Field` and estimate the entire trajectory of network weight training instead of simply its converged state. In other words, we introduce an additional input to the Hypernetwork, the convergence state, which then makes it act as a neural field that models the entire convergence pathway of a task network. A critical benefit in doing so is that the gradient of the estimated weights at any convergence state must then match the gradients of the original task -- this constraint alone is sufficient to train the Hypernetwork Field. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through the task of personalized image generation and 3D shape reconstruction from images and point clouds, demonstrating competitive results without any per-sample ground truth.</p></details> |  |

As the backbone of next-generation solutions, these robots face a critical challenge: managing and minimizing the swept volume during turns while maintaining precise control. Traditional systems designed for standard vehicles often struggle with the complex dynamics of multi-axle configurations, leading to inefficiency and increased safety risk in confined spaces. Our innovative framework overcomes these limitations by combining swept volume minimization with Signed Distance Field (SDF) path planning and model predictive control (MPC) for independent wheel steering. This approach not only plans paths with an awareness of the swept volume but actively minimizes it in real-time, allowing each axle to follow a precise trajectory while significantly reducing the space the vehicle occupies. By predicting future states and adjusting the turning radius of each wheel, our method enhances both maneuverability and safety, even in the most constrained environments. Unlike previous works, our solution goes beyond basic path calculation and tracking, offering real-time path optimization with minimal swept volume and efficient individual axle control. To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive approach to tackle these challenges, delivering life-saving improvements in control, efficiency, and safety for multi-axle AMRs.

Furthermore, when the majority of MPPI sampled trajectories concentrate in high-cost regions, it may generate an infeasible control sequence. To address this challenge, we propose the U-MPPI control strategy, a novel methodology that can effectively manage system uncertainties while integrating a more efficient trajectory sampling strategy. The core concept is to leverage the Unscented Transform (UT) to propagate not only the mean but also the covariance of the system dynamics, going beyond the traditional MPPI method. As a result, it introduces a novel and more efficient trajectory sampling strategy, significantly enhancing state-space exploration and ultimately reducing the risk of being trapped in local minima. Furthermore, by leveraging the uncertainty information provided by UT, we incorporate a risk-sensitive cost function that explicitly accounts for risk or uncertainty throughout the trajectory evaluation process, resulting in a more resilient control system capable of handling uncertain conditions. By conducting extensive simulations of 2D aggressive autonomous navigation in both known and unknown cluttered environments, we verify the efficiency and robustness of our proposed U-MPPI control strategy compared to the baseline MPPI. We further validate the practicality of U-MPPI through real-world demonstrations in unknown cluttered environments, showcasing its superior ability to incorporate both the UT and local costmap into the optimization problem without introducing additional complexity.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper comprises 20 pages, 11 figures, 4 tables, 1 algorithm, and 1 appendix.

| **[Surrogate Modeling of Trajectory Map-matching in Urban Road Networks using Transformer Sequence-to-Sequence Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12460v3)** | 2024-12-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large-scale geolocation telematics data acquired from connected vehicles has the potential to significantly enhance mobility infrastructures and operational systems within smart cities. To effectively utilize this data, it is essential to accurately match the geolocation data to the road segments. However, this matching is often not trivial due to the low sampling rate and errors exacerbated by multipath effects in urban environments. Traditionally, statistical modeling techniques such as Hidden-Markov models incorporating domain knowledge into the matching process have been extensively used for map-matching tasks. However, rule-based map-matching tasks are noise-sensitive and inefficient in processing large-scale trajectory data. Deep learning techniques directly learn the relationship between observed data and road networks from the data, often without the need for hand-crafted rules or domain knowledge. This renders them an efficient approach for map-matching large-scale datasets and more robust to the noise. This paper introduces a deep-learning model, specifically the transformer-based encoder-decoder model, to perform as a surrogate for offline map-matching algorithms. The encoder-decoder architecture initially encodes the series of noisy GPS points into a representation that automatically captures hidden contextual structures and spatial correlations between GPS points. Subsequently, the decoder associates data points with the road network features and thus transforms these representations into a sequence of road segments. The model is trained and evaluated using GPS traces collected in Manhattan, New York. Achieving an accuracy of 75%, transformer-based encoder-decoder models extensively employed in natural language processing presented a promising performance for translating noisy GPS data to the navigated routes in urban road networks.</p></details> | 15 pages, 10 figures |

Our simulator efficiently models vehicle motion, generating trajectories that can be supervised to fit real-world data. By leveraging its differentiable nature, IDM parameters are optimized using gradient-based methods. With the capability to simulate up to 2 million vehicles in real time, the system is scalable for large-scale trajectory optimization. We show that we can use the simulator to filter noise in the input trajectories (trajectory filtering), reconstruct dense trajectories from sparse ones (trajectory reconstruction), and predict future trajectories (trajectory prediction), with all generated trajectories adhering to physical laws. We validate our simulator and algorithm on several datasets including NGSIM and Waymo Open Dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 6 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |
| **[Choice Between Partial Trajectories: Disentangling Goals from Beliefs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22690v3)** | 2024-12-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As AI agents generate increasingly sophisticated behaviors, manually encoding human preferences to guide these agents becomes more challenging. To address this, it has been suggested that agents instead learn preferences from human choice data. This approach requires a model of choice behavior that the agent can use to interpret the data. For choices between partial trajectories of states and actions, previous models assume choice probabilities are determined by the partial return or the cumulative advantage. We consider an alternative model based instead on the bootstrapped return, which adds to the partial return an estimate of the future return. Benefits of the bootstrapped return model stem from its treatment of human beliefs. Unlike partial return, choices based on bootstrapped return reflect human beliefs about the environment. Further, while recovering the reward function from choices based on cumulative advantage requires that those beliefs are correct, doing so from choices based on bootstrapped return does not. To motivate the bootstrapped return model, we formulate axioms and prove an Alignment Theorem. This result formalizes how, for a general class of preferences, such models are able to disentangle goals from beliefs. This ensures recovery of an aligned reward function when learning from choices based on bootstrapped return. The bootstrapped return model also affords greater robustness to choice behavior. Even when choices are based on partial return, learning via a bootstrapped return model recovers an aligned reward function. The same holds with choices based on the cumulative advantage if the human and the agent both adhere to correct and consistent beliefs about the environment. On the other hand, if choices are based on bootstrapped return, learning via partial return or cumulative advantage models does not generally produce an aligned reward function.</p></details> |  |
| **[Effective and Efficient Representation Learning for Flight Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16581v1)** | 2024-12-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Flight trajectory data plays a vital role in the traffic management community, especially for downstream tasks such as trajectory prediction, flight recognition, and anomaly detection. Existing works often utilize handcrafted features and design models for different tasks individually, which heavily rely on domain expertise and are hard to extend. We argue that different flight analysis tasks share the same useful features of the trajectory. Jointly learning a unified representation for flight trajectories could be beneficial for improving the performance of various tasks. However, flight trajectory representation learning (TRL) faces two primary challenges, \ie unbalanced behavior density and 3D spatial continuity, which disable recent general TRL methods. In this paper, we propose Flight2Vec , a flight-specific representation learning method to address these challenges. Specifically, a behavior-adaptive patching mechanism is used to inspire the learned representation to pay more attention to behavior-dense segments. Moreover, we introduce a motion trend learning technique that guides the model to memorize not only the precise locations, but also the motion trend to generate better representations. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that Flight2Vec significantly improves performance in downstream tasks such as flight trajectory prediction, flight recognition, and anomaly detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2025</p></details> |
| **[Recurrent Aligned Network for Generalized Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05810v2)** | 2024-12-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pedestrian trajectory prediction is a crucial component in computer vision and robotics, but remains challenging due to the domain shift problem. Previous studies have tried to tackle this problem by leveraging a portion of the trajectory data from the target domain to adapt the model. However, such domain adaptation methods are impractical in real-world scenarios, as it is infeasible to collect trajectory data from all potential target domains. In this paper, we study a task named generalized pedestrian trajectory prediction, with the aim of generalizing the model to unseen domains without accessing their trajectories. To tackle this task, we introduce a Recurrent Aligned Network~(RAN) to minimize the domain gap through domain alignment. Specifically, we devise a recurrent alignment module to effectively align the trajectory feature spaces at both time-state and time-sequence levels by the recurrent alignment strategy.Furthermore, we introduce a pre-aligned representation module to combine social interactions with the recurrent alignment strategy, which aims to consider social interactions during the alignment process instead of just target trajectories. We extensively evaluate our method and compare it with state-of-the-art methods on three widely used benchmarks. The experimental results demonstrate the superior generalization capability of our method. Our work not only fills the gap in the generalization setting for practical pedestrian trajectory prediction but also sets strong baselines in this field.</p></details> |  |
| **[In-Dataset Trajectory Return Regularization for Offline Preference-based Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09104v2)** | 2024-12-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Offline preference-based reinforcement learning (PbRL) typically operates in two phases: first, use human preferences to learn a reward model and annotate rewards for a reward-free offline dataset; second, learn a policy by optimizing the learned reward via offline RL. However, accurately modeling step-wise rewards from trajectory-level preference feedback presents inherent challenges. The reward bias introduced, particularly the overestimation of predicted rewards, leads to optimistic trajectory stitching, which undermines the pessimism mechanism critical to the offline RL phase. To address this challenge, we propose In-Dataset Trajectory Return Regularization (DTR) for offline PbRL, which leverages conditional sequence modeling to mitigate the risk of learning inaccurate trajectory stitching under reward bias. Specifically, DTR employs Decision Transformer and TD-Learning to strike a balance between maintaining fidelity to the behavior policy with high in-dataset trajectory returns and selecting optimal actions based on high reward labels. Additionally, we introduce an ensemble normalization technique that effectively integrates multiple reward models, balancing the tradeoff between reward differentiation and accuracy. Empirical evaluations on various benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of DTR over other state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, Proceedings of the 39th AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI-25)</p></details> |

| **[An Attentive Graph Agent for Topology-Adaptive Cyber Defence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14700v1)** | 2025-01-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As cyber threats grow increasingly sophisticated, reinforcement learning is emerging as a promising technique to create intelligent, self-improving defensive systems. However, most existing autonomous defensive agents have overlooked the inherent graph structure of computer networks subject to cyber attacks, potentially missing critical information. To address this gap, we developed a custom version of the Cyber Operations Research Gym (CybORG) environment that encodes the observable network state as a directed graph, utilizing realistic and interpretable low-level features. %, like number of open ports and unexpected detected connections. We leverage a Graph Attention Network (GAT) architecture to process node, edge, and global features, and modify its output to be compatible with policy gradient methods in reinforcement learning. GAT policies offer several advantages over standard approaches based on simplistic flattened state observations. They can handle the changes in network topology that occur at runtime when dynamic connections between hosts appear. Policies can be deployed to networks that differ in size to the ones seen during training, enabling a degree of generalisation inaccessible with alternative approaches. Furthermore, the graph neural network policies outputs are explainable in terms of tangible network properties, providing enhanced interpretability of defensive actions. We verify that our low-level graph observations are meaningful enough to train GAT defensive policies that are able to adapt to changing topologies. We evaluate how our trained policies perform when deployed on networks of varying sizes with the same subnetwork structure, comparing them against policies specifically trained for each network configuration. Our study contributes to the development of robust cyber defence systems that can better adapt to real-world network security challenges.</p></details> |  |
| **[On the Homophily of Heterogeneous Graphs: Understanding and Unleashing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14600v1)** | 2025-01-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Homophily, the tendency of similar nodes to connect, is a fundamental phenomenon in network science and a critical factor in the performance of graph neural networks (GNNs). While existing studies primarily explore homophily in homogeneous graphs, where nodes share the same type, real-world networks are often more accurately modeled as heterogeneous graphs (HGs) with diverse node types and intricate cross-type interactions. This structural diversity complicates the analysis of homophily, as traditional homophily metrics fail to account for distinct label spaces across node types. To address this limitation, we introduce the Cross-Type Homophily Ratio, a novel metric that quantifies homophily based on the similarity of target information across different node types. Furthermore, we introduce Cross-Type Homophily-guided Heterogeneous Graph Pruning, a method designed to selectively remove low-homophily crosstype edges, thereby enhancing the Cross-Type Homophily Ratio and boosting the performance of heterogeneous graph neural networks (HGNNs). Extensive experiments on five real-world HG datasets validate the effectiveness of our approach, which delivers up to 13.36% average relative performance improvement for HGNNs, offering a fresh perspective on cross-type homophily in heterogeneous graph learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Disentangled Condensation for Large-scale Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12231v3)** | 2025-01-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph condensation has emerged as an intriguing technique to save the expensive training costs of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) by substituting a condensed small graph with the original graph. Despite the promising results achieved, previous methods usually employ an entangled paradigm of redundant parameters (nodes, edges, GNNs), which incurs complex joint optimization during condensation. This paradigm has considerably impeded the scalability of graph condensation, making it challenging to condense extremely large-scale graphs and generate high-fidelity condensed graphs. Therefore, we propose to disentangle the condensation process into a two-stage GNN-free paradigm, independently condensing nodes and generating edges while eliminating the need to optimize GNNs at the same time. The node condensation module avoids the complexity of GNNs by focusing on node feature alignment with anchors of the original graph, while the edge translation module constructs the edges of the condensed nodes by transferring the original structure knowledge with neighborhood anchors. This simple yet effective approach achieves at least 10 times faster than state-of-the-art methods with comparable accuracy on medium-scale graphs. Moreover, the proposed DisCo can successfully scale up to the Ogbn-papers100M graph containing over 100 million nodes with flexible reduction rates and improves performance on the second-largest Ogbn-products dataset by over 5%. Extensive downstream tasks and ablation study on five common datasets further demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed DisCo framework.

| **[Backdoor Attack on Vertical Federated Graph Neural Network Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11290v2)** | 2025-01-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated Graph Neural Network (FedGNN) integrate federated learning (FL) with graph neural networks (GNNs) to enable privacy-preserving training on distributed graph data. Vertical Federated Graph Neural Network (VFGNN), a key branch of FedGNN, handles scenarios where data features and labels are distributed among participants. Despite the robust privacy-preserving design of VFGNN, we have found that it still faces the risk of backdoor attacks, even in situations where labels are inaccessible. This paper proposes BVG, a novel backdoor attack method that leverages multi-hop triggers and backdoor retention, requiring only four target-class nodes to execute effective attacks. Experimental results demonstrate that BVG achieves nearly 100% attack success rates across three commonly used datasets and three GNN models, with minimal impact on the main task accuracy. We also evaluated various defense methods, and the BVG method maintained high attack effectiveness even under existing defenses. This finding highlights the need for advanced defense mechanisms to counter sophisticated backdoor attacks in practical VFGNN applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Polynomial Selection in Spectral Graph Neural Networks: An Error-Sum of Function Slices Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15354v2)** | 2025-01-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spectral graph neural networks are proposed to harness spectral information inherent in graph-structured data through the application of polynomial-defined graph filters, recently achieving notable success in graph-based web applications. Existing studies reveal that various polynomial choices greatly impact spectral GNN performance, underscoring the importance of polynomial selection. However, this selection process remains a critical and unresolved challenge. Although prior work suggests a connection between the approximation capabilities of polynomials and the efficacy of spectral GNNs, there is a lack of theoretical insights into this relationship, rendering polynomial selection a largely heuristic process. To address the issue, this paper examines polynomial selection from an error-sum of function slices perspective. Inspired by the conventional signal decomposition, we represent graph filters as a sum of disjoint function slices. Building on this, we then bridge the polynomial capability and spectral GNN efficacy by proving that the construction error of graph convolution layer is bounded by the sum of polynomial approximation errors on function slices. This result leads us to develop an advanced filter based on trigonometric polynomials, a widely adopted option for approximating narrow signal slices. The proposed filter remains provable parameter efficiency, with a novel Taylor-based parameter decomposition that achieves streamlined, effective implementation. With this foundation, we propose TFGNN, a scalable spectral GNN operating in a decoupled paradigm. We validate the efficacy of TFGNN via benchmark node classification tasks, along with an example graph anomaly detection application to show its practical utility.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in ACM The Web Conference 2025, WWW 2025</p></details> |
| **[Convergence of gradient based training for linear Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14440v1)** | 2025-01-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are powerful tools for addressing learning problems on graph structures, with a wide range of applications in molecular biology and social networks. However, the theoretical foundations underlying their empirical performance are not well understood. In this article, we examine the convergence of gradient dynamics in the training of linear GNNs. Specifically, we prove that the gradient flow training of a linear GNN with mean squared loss converges to the global minimum at an exponential rate. The convergence rate depends explicitly on the initial weights and the graph shift operator, which we validate on synthetic datasets from well-known graph models and real-world datasets. Furthermore, we discuss the gradient flow that minimizes the total weights at the global minimum. In addition to the gradient flow, we study the convergence of linear GNNs under gradient descent training, an iterative scheme viewed as a discretization of gradient flow.</p></details> | 27 pages, 8 figures |

| **[MeshMask: Physics-Based Simulations with Masked Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08738v3)** | 2025-01-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a novel masked pre-training technique for graph neural networks (GNNs) applied to computational fluid dynamics (CFD) problems. By randomly masking up to 40\% of input mesh nodes during pre-training, we force the model to learn robust representations of complex fluid dynamics. We pair this masking strategy with an asymmetric encoder-decoder architecture and gated multi-layer perceptrons to further enhance performance. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results on seven CFD datasets, including a new challenging dataset of 3D intracranial aneurysm simulations with over 250,000 nodes per mesh. Moreover, it significantly improves model performance and training efficiency across such diverse range of fluid simulation tasks. We demonstrate improvements of up to 60\% in long-term prediction accuracy compared to previous best models, while maintaining similar computational costs. Notably, our approach enables effective pre-training on multiple datasets simultaneously, significantly reducing the time and data required to achieve high performance on new tasks. Through extensive ablation studies, we provide insights into the optimal masking ratio, architectural choices, and training strategies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adaptive Progressive Attention Graph Neural Network for EEG Emotion Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14246v1)** | 2025-01-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, numerous neuroscientific studies have shown that human emotions are closely linked to specific brain regions, with these regions exhibiting variability across individuals and emotional states. To fully leverage these neural patterns, we propose an Adaptive Progressive Attention Graph Neural Network (APAGNN), which dynamically captures the spatial relationships among brain regions during emotional processing. The APAGNN employs three specialized experts that progressively analyze brain topology. The first expert captures global brain patterns, the second focuses on region-specific features, and the third examines emotion-related channels. This hierarchical approach enables increasingly refined analysis of neural activity. Additionally, a weight generator integrates the outputs of all three experts, balancing their contributions to produce the final predictive label. Extensive experiments on three publicly available datasets (SEED, SEED-IV and MPED) demonstrate that the proposed method enhances EEG emotion recognition performance, achieving superior results compared to baseline methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Top Ten Challenges Towards Agentic Neural Graph Databases](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14224v1)** | 2025-01-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph databases (GDBs) like Neo4j and TigerGraph excel at handling interconnected data but lack advanced inference capabilities. Neural Graph Databases (NGDBs) address this by integrating Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for predictive analysis and reasoning over incomplete or noisy data. However, NGDBs rely on predefined queries and lack autonomy and adaptability. This paper introduces Agentic Neural Graph Databases (Agentic NGDBs), which extend NGDBs with three core functionalities: autonomous query construction, neural query execution, and continuous learning. We identify ten key challenges in realizing Agentic NGDBs: semantic unit representation, abductive reasoning, scalable query execution, and integration with foundation models like large language models (LLMs). By addressing these challenges, Agentic NGDBs can enable intelligent, self-improving systems for modern data-driven applications, paving the way for adaptable and autonomous data management solutions.</p></details> | 12 Pages |
| **[Motif-aware Attribute Masking for Molecular Graph Pre-training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.04589v2)** | 2025-01-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Attribute reconstruction is used to predict node or edge features in the pre-training of graph neural networks. Given a large number of molecules, they learn to capture structural knowledge, which is transferable for various downstream property prediction tasks and vital in chemistry, biomedicine, and material science. Previous strategies that randomly select nodes to do attribute masking leverage the information of local neighbors However, the over-reliance of these neighbors inhibits the model's ability to learn from higher-level substructures. For example, the model would learn little from predicting three carbon atoms in a benzene ring based on the other three but could learn more from the inter-connections between the functional groups, or called chemical motifs. In this work, we propose and investigate motif-aware attribute masking strategies to capture inter-motif structures by leveraging the information of atoms in neighboring motifs. Once each graph is decomposed into disjoint motifs, the features for every node within a sample motif are masked. The graph decoder then predicts the masked features of each node within the motif for reconstruction. We evaluate our approach on eight molecular property prediction datasets and demonstrate its advantages.</p></details> |  |
| **[Crossfire: An Elastic Defense Framework for Graph Neural Networks Under Bit Flip Attacks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13776v1)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Bit Flip Attacks (BFAs) are a well-established class of adversarial attacks, originally developed for Convolutional Neural Networks within the computer vision domain. Most recently, these attacks have been extended to target Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), revealing significant vulnerabilities. This new development naturally raises questions about the best strategies to defend GNNs against BFAs, a challenge for which no solutions currently exist. Given the applications of GNNs in critical fields, any defense mechanism must not only maintain network performance, but also verifiably restore the network to its pre-attack state. Verifiably restoring the network to its pre-attack state also eliminates the need for costly evaluations on test data to ensure network quality. We offer first insights into the effectiveness of existing honeypot- and hashing-based defenses against BFAs adapted from the computer vision domain to GNNs, and characterize the shortcomings of these approaches. To overcome their limitations, we propose Crossfire, a hybrid approach that exploits weight sparsity and combines hashing and honeypots with bit-level correction of out-of-distribution weight elements to restore network integrity. Crossfire is retraining-free and does not require labeled data. Averaged over 2,160 experiments on six benchmark datasets, Crossfire offers a 21.8% higher probability than its competitors of reconstructing a GNN attacked by a BFA to its pre-attack state. These experiments cover up to 55 bit flips from various attacks. Moreover, it improves post-repair prediction quality by 10.85%. Computational and storage overheads are negligible compared to the inherent complexity of even the simplest GNNs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at AAAI 2025, DOI will be included after publication</p></details> |

Despite the surge of intense interest in practical techniques like Bayesian optimization and random search based approaches to automating this laborious and compute-intensive task, the fundamental learning theoretic complexity of tuning hyperparameters for deep neural networks is poorly understood. Inspired by this glaring gap, we initiate the formal study of hyperparameter tuning complexity in deep learning through a recently introduced data driven setting. We assume that we have a series of deep learning tasks, and we have to tune hyperparameters to do well on average over the distribution of tasks. A major difficulty is that the utility function as a function of the hyperparameter is very volatile and furthermore, it is given implicitly by an optimization problem over the model parameters. This is unlike previous work in data driven design, where one can typically explicitly model the algorithmic behavior as a function of the hyperparameters. To tackle this challenge, we introduce a new technique to characterize the discontinuities and oscillations of the utility function on any fixed problem instance as we vary the hyperparameter, our analysis relies on subtle concepts including tools from differential/algebraic geometry and constrained optimization. This can be used to show that the learning theoretic complexity of the corresponding family of utility functions is bounded. We instantiate our results and provide sample complexity bounds for concrete applications tuning a hyperparameter that interpolates neural activation functions and setting the kernel parameter in graph neural networks.</p></details> | 48 pages, 4 figures |

The generated Inverse Kinematics is generalized to a family of manipulators with the same Degree of Freedom (DOF), but varying link length configurations. The results indicate a position error of less than 1.0 cm for 3 DOF and 4.5 cm for 5 DOF, and orientation error of 2$^\circ$ for 3 DOF and 8.2$^\circ$ for 6 DOF, which allows the deployment to certain real world-problems. However, out-of-domain errors and lack of extrapolation can be observed in the resulting GNN. An extensive analysis of these errors indicates potential for enhancement in the future. Consequently, the generated GNNs are tailored to be used in future work as an inductive bias to generate analytical equations through symbolic regression.</p></details> |  |

As datasets grow larger in real-world scenarios, the risk of exposing sensitive information increases, making privacy-preserving training methods like federated learning (FL) essential to ensure data security and compliance with privacy regulations. Recently proposed personalized subgraph FL methods have become the de-facto standard for training personalized Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in a federated manner while dealing with the missing links across clients' subgraphs due to privacy restrictions. However, personalized subgraph FL faces significant challenges due to the heterogeneity in client subgraphs, such as degree distributions among the nodes, which complicate federated training of graph models. To address these challenges, we propose \textit{FedGrAINS}, a novel data-adaptive and sampling-based regularization method for subgraph FL. FedGrAINS leverages generative flow networks (GFlowNets) to evaluate node importance concerning clients' tasks, dynamically adjusting the message-passing step in clients' GNNs. This adaptation reflects task-optimized sampling aligned with a trajectory balance objective. Experimental results demonstrate that the inclusion of \textit{FedGrAINS} as a regularizer consistently improves the FL performance compared to baselines that do not leverage such regularization.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to SDM2025 (SIAM Data Mining 2025)</p></details> |

However, delivering FVV poses significant challenges due to the uncertainty in view switching, combined with the substantial bandwidth and computational resources required to transmit and decode multiple video streams, which may result in frequent playback interruptions. Existing approaches, either client-based or cloud-based, struggle to meet high Quality of Experience (QoE) requirements under limited bandwidth and computational resources. To address these issues, we propose VARFVV, a bandwidth- and computationally-efficient system that enables real-time interactive FVV streaming with high QoE and low switching delay. Specifically, VARFVV introduces a low-complexity FVV generation scheme that reassembles multiview video frames at the edge server based on user-selected view tracks, eliminating the need for transcoding and significantly reducing computational overhead. This design makes it well-suited for large-scale, mobile-based UHD FVV experiences. Furthermore, we present a popularity-adaptive bit allocation method, leveraging a graph neural network, that predicts view popularity and dynamically adjusts bit allocation to maximize QoE within bandwidth constraints. We also construct an FVV dataset comprising 330 videos from 10 scenes, including basketball, opera, etc. Extensive experiments show that VARFVV surpasses existing methods in video quality, switching latency, computational efficiency, and bandwidth usage, supporting over 500 users on a single edge server with a switching delay of 71.5ms.

Existing methods employ learnable graph structures and graph neural networks to explicitly model the spatial dependencies between variables. However, these methods are primarily based on prediction or reconstruction tasks, which can only learn similarity relationships between sequence embeddings and lack interpretability in how graph structures affect time series evolution. In this paper, we designed a framework that models spatial dependencies using interpretable causal relationships and detects anomalies through changes in causal patterns. Specifically, we propose a method to dynamically discover Granger causality using gradients in nonlinear deep predictors and employ a simple sparsification strategy to obtain a Granger causality graph, detecting anomalies from a causal perspective. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed model achieves more accurate anomaly detection compared to baseline methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AAAI 2025</p></details> |

To help researchers develop more robust GNN models, it's essential to focus on designing strong attack models as foundational benchmarks and guiding references. Among adversarial attacks, gray-box poisoning attacks are noteworthy due to their effectiveness and fewer constraints. These attacks exploit GNNs' need for retraining on updated data, thereby impacting their performance by perturbing these datasets. However, current research overlooks the real-world scenario of incomplete graphs.To address this gap, we introduce the Robust Incomplete Deep Attack Framework (RIDA). It is the first algorithm for robust gray-box poisoning attacks on incomplete graphs. The approach innovatively aggregates distant vertex information and ensures powerful data utilization.Extensive tests against 9 SOTA baselines on 3 real-world datasets demonstrate RIDA's superiority in handling incompleteness and high attack performance on the incomplete graph.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rethinking and Accelerating Graph Condensation: A Training-Free Approach with Class Partition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13707v2)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The increasing prevalence of large-scale graphs poses a significant challenge for graph neural network training, attributed to their substantial computational requirements. In response, graph condensation (GC) emerges as a promising data-centric solution aiming to substitute the large graph with a small yet informative condensed graph to facilitate data-efficient GNN training. However, existing GC methods suffer from intricate optimization processes, necessitating excessive computing resources and training time. In this paper, we revisit existing GC optimization strategies and identify two pervasive issues therein: (1) various GC optimization strategies converge to coarse-grained class-level node feature matching between the original and condensed graphs; (2) existing GC methods rely on a Siamese graph network architecture that requires time-consuming bi-level optimization with iterative gradient computations. To overcome these issues, we propose a training-free GC framework termed Class-partitioned Graph Condensation (CGC), which refines the node distribution matching from the class-to-class paradigm into a novel class-to-node paradigm, transforming the GC optimization into a class partition problem which can be efficiently solved by any clustering methods. Moreover, CGC incorporates a pre-defined graph structure to enable a closed-form solution for condensed node features, eliminating the need for back-and-forth gradient descent in existing GC approaches. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CGC achieves an exceedingly efficient condensation process with advanced accuracy. Compared with the state-of-the-art GC methods, CGC condenses the Ogbn-products graph within 30 seconds, achieving a speedup ranging from $10^2$X to $10^4$X and increasing accuracy by up to 4.2%.</p></details> | <details><summary>ACM W...</summary><p>ACM Web Conference 2025 (WWW '25)</p></details> |
| **[An Efficient Sparse Kernel Generator for O(3)-Equivariant Deep Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13986v1)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Rotation equivariant graph neural networks, i.e., networks designed to guarantee certain geometric relations between their inputs and outputs, yield state-of-the-art performance on spatial deep learning tasks. They exhibit high data efficiency during training and significantly reduced inference time for interatomic potential calculations compared to classical approaches. Key to these models is the Clebsch-Gordon (CG) tensor product, a kernel that contracts two dense feature vectors with a highly structured sparse tensor to produce a dense output vector. The operation, which may be repeated millions of times for typical equivariant models, is a costly and inefficient bottleneck. We introduce a GPU sparse kernel generator for the CG tensor product that provides significant speedup over the best existing open and closed-source implementations. Our implementation achieves high performance by carefully managing GPU shared memory through static analysis at model compile-time, minimizing reads and writes to global memory. We break the tensor product into a series of kernels with operands that fit entirely into registers, enabling us to emit long arithmetic instruction streams that maximize instruction-level parallelism. By fusing the CG tensor product with a subsequent graph convolution, we reduce both intermediate storage and global memory traffic over naive approaches that duplicate input data. We also provide optimized kernels for the gradient of the CG tensor product and a novel identity for the higher partial derivatives required to predict interatomic forces. Our fused kernels offer up to 4.5x speedup for the forward pass and 3x for the backward pass over NVIDIA cuEquivariance, as well as >10x speedup over the widely-used e3nn package. We offer up to 5.3x inference-time speedup for the MACE chemistry foundation model over the original unoptimized version.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 9 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |
| **[KAA: Kolmogorov-Arnold Attention for Enhancing Attentive Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13456v1)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) with attention mechanisms, often referred to as attentive GNNs, have emerged as a prominent paradigm in advanced GNN models in recent years. However, our understanding of the critical process of scoring neighbor nodes remains limited, leading to the underperformance of many existing attentive GNNs. In this paper, we unify the scoring functions of current attentive GNNs and propose Kolmogorov-Arnold Attention (KAA), which integrates the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) architecture into the scoring process. KAA enhances the performance of scoring functions across the board and can be applied to nearly all existing attentive GNNs. To compare the expressive power of KAA with other scoring functions, we introduce Maximum Ranking Distance (MRD) to quantitatively estimate their upper bounds in ranking errors for node importance. Our analysis reveals that, under limited parameters and constraints on width and depth, both linear transformation-based and MLP-based scoring functions exhibit finite expressive power. In contrast, our proposed KAA, even with a single-layer KAN parameterized by zero-order B-spline functions, demonstrates nearly infinite expressive power. Extensive experiments on both node-level and graph-level tasks using various backbone models show that KAA-enhanced scoring functions consistently outperform their original counterparts, achieving performance improvements of over 20% in some cases.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generative Graphical Inverse Kinematics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.08812v5)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quickly and reliably finding accurate inverse kinematics (IK) solutions remains a challenging problem for many robot manipulators. Existing numerical solvers are broadly applicable but typically only produce a single solution and rely on local search techniques to minimize nonconvex objective functions. More recent learning-based approaches that approximate the entire feasible set of solutions have shown promise as a means to generate multiple fast and accurate IK results in parallel. However, existing learning-based techniques have a significant drawback: each robot of interest requires a specialized model that must be trained from scratch. To address this key shortcoming, we propose a novel distance-geometric robot representation coupled with a graph structure that allows us to leverage the sample efficiency of Euclidean equivariant functions and the generalizability of graph neural networks (GNNs). Our approach is generative graphical inverse kinematics (GGIK), the first learned IK solver able to accurately and efficiently produce a large number of diverse solutions in parallel while also displaying the ability to generalize -- a single learned model can be used to produce IK solutions for a variety of different robots. When compared to several other learned IK methods, GGIK provides more accurate solutions with the same amount of data. GGIK can generalize reasonably well to robot manipulators unseen during training. Additionally, GGIK can learn a constrained distribution that encodes joint limits and scales efficiently to larger robots and a high number of sampled solutions. Finally, GGIK can be used to complement local IK solvers by providing reliable initializations for a local optimization process.</p></details> | 17 pages, 9 figures |

We employ Graph Neural Networks (GNN) to predict stresses on complex geometries for polycrystal plasticity from Finite Element Method (FEM) simulations. We present a novel message-passing GNN that encodes nodal strain and edge distances between FEM mesh cells, and aggregates to obtain embeddings and combines the decoded embeddings with the nodal strains to predict stress tensors on graph nodes. The GNN is trained on subgraphs generated from FEM mesh graphs, in which the mesh cells are converted to nodes and edges are created between adjacent cells. We apply the trained GNN to periodic polycrystals with complex geometries and learn the strain-stress maps based on crystal plasticity theory. The GNN is accurately trained on FEM graphs, in which the $R^2$ for both training and testing sets are larger than 0.99. The proposed GNN approach speeds up more than 150 times compared with FEM on stress predictions. We also apply the trained GNN to unseen simulations for validations and the GNN generalizes well with an overall $R^2$ of 0.992. The GNN accurately predicts the von Mises stress on polycrystals. The proposed model does not overfit and generalizes well beyond the training data, as the error distributions demonstrate. This work outlooks surrogating crystal plasticity simulations using graph data.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 11 figures (main manuscript)</p></details> |
| **[Deep Inverse Design for High-Level Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08797v2)** | 2025-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-level synthesis (HLS) has significantly advanced the automation of digital circuits design, yet the need for expertise and time in pragma tuning remains challenging. Existing solutions for the design space exploration (DSE) adopt either heuristic methods, lacking essential information for further optimization potential, or predictive models, missing sufficient generalization due to the time-consuming nature of HLS and the exponential growth of the design space. To address these challenges, we propose Deep Inverse Design for HLS (DID4HLS), a novel approach that integrates graph neural networks and generative models. DID4HLS iteratively optimizes hardware designs aimed at compute-intensive algorithms by learning conditional distributions of design features from post-HLS data. Compared to four state-of-the-art DSE baselines, our method achieved an average improvement of 42.8% on average distance to reference set (ADRS) compared to the best-performing baselines across six benchmarks, while demonstrating high robustness and efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[HierPromptLM: A Pure PLM-based Framework for Representation Learning on Heterogeneous Text-rich Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12857v1)** | 2025-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Representation learning on heterogeneous text-rich networks (HTRNs), which consist of multiple types of nodes and edges with each node associated with textual information, is essential for various real-world applications. Given the success of pretrained language models (PLMs) in processing text data, recent efforts have focused on integrating PLMs into HTRN representation learning. These methods typically handle textual and structural information separately, using both PLMs and heterogeneous graph neural networks (HGNNs). However, this separation fails to capture the critical interactions between these two types of information within HTRNs. Additionally, it necessitates an extra alignment step, which is challenging due to the fundamental differences between distinct embedding spaces generated by PLMs and HGNNs. To deal with it, we propose HierPromptLM, a novel pure PLM-based framework that seamlessly models both text data and graph structures without the need for separate processing. Firstly, we develop a Hierarchical Prompt module that employs prompt learning to integrate text data and heterogeneous graph structures at both the node and edge levels, within a unified textual space. Building upon this foundation, we further introduce two innovative HTRN-tailored pretraining tasks to fine-tune PLMs for representation learning by emphasizing the inherent heterogeneity and interactions between textual and structural information within HTRNs. Extensive experiments on two real-world HTRN datasets demonstrate HierPromptLM outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving significant improvements of up to 6.08% for node classification and 10.84% for link prediction.</p></details> |  |
| **[GRAMA: Adaptive Graph Autoregressive Moving Average Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12732v1)** | 2025-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph State Space Models (SSMs) have recently been introduced to enhance Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in modeling long-range interactions. Despite their success, existing methods either compromise on permutation equivariance or limit their focus to pairwise interactions rather than sequences. Building on the connection between Autoregressive Moving Average (ARMA) and SSM, in this paper, we introduce GRAMA, a Graph Adaptive method based on a learnable Autoregressive Moving Average (ARMA) framework that addresses these limitations. By transforming from static to sequential graph data, GRAMA leverages the strengths of the ARMA framework, while preserving permutation equivariance. Moreover, GRAMA incorporates a selective attention mechanism for dynamic learning of ARMA coefficients, enabling efficient and flexible long-range information propagation. We also establish theoretical connections between GRAMA and Selective SSMs, providing insights into its ability to capture long-range dependencies. Extensive experiments on 14 synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that GRAMA consistently outperforms backbone models and performs competitively with state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[KAN KAN Buff Signed Graph Neural Networks?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00709v3)** | 2025-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Representation Learning aims to create effective embeddings for nodes and edges that encapsulate their features and relationships. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) leverage neural networks to model complex graph structures. Recently, the Kolmogorov-Arnold Neural Network (KAN) has emerged as a promising alternative to the traditional Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), offering improved accuracy and interpretability with fewer parameters. In this paper, we propose the integration of KANs into Signed Graph Convolutional Networks (SGCNs), leading to the development of KAN-enhanced SGCNs (KASGCN). We evaluate KASGCN on tasks such as signed community detection and link sign prediction to improve embedding quality in signed networks. Our experimental results indicate that KASGCN exhibits competitive or comparable performance to standard SGCNs across the tasks evaluated, with performance variability depending on the specific characteristics of the signed graph and the choice of parameter settings. These findings suggest that KASGCNs hold promise for enhancing signed graph analysis with context-dependent effectiveness.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exploring Heterogeneity and Uncertainty for Graph-based Cognitive Diagnosis Models in Intelligent Education](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05559v2)** | 2025-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph-based Cognitive Diagnosis (CD) has attracted much research interest due to its strong ability on inferring students' proficiency levels on knowledge concepts. While graph-based CD models have demonstrated remarkable performance, we contend that they still cannot achieve optimal performance due to the neglect of edge heterogeneity and uncertainty. Edges involve both correct and incorrect response logs, indicating heterogeneity. Meanwhile, a response log can have uncertain semantic meanings, e.g., a correct log can indicate true mastery or fortunate guessing, and a wrong log can indicate a lack of understanding or a careless mistake. In this paper, we propose an Informative Semantic-aware Graph-based Cognitive Diagnosis model (ISG-CD), which focuses on how to utilize the heterogeneous graph in CD and minimize effects of uncertain edges. Specifically, to explore heterogeneity, we propose a semantic-aware graph neural networks based CD model. To minimize effects of edge uncertainty, we propose an Informative Edge Differentiation layer from an information bottleneck perspective, which suggests keeping a minimal yet sufficient reliable graph for CD in an unsupervised way. We formulate this process as maximizing mutual information between the reliable graph and response logs, while minimizing mutual information between the reliable graph and the original graph. After that, we prove that mutual information maximization can be theoretically converted to the classic binary cross entropy loss function, while minimizing mutual information can be realized by the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion. Finally, we adopt an alternating training strategy for optimizing learnable parameters of both the semantic-aware graph neural networks based CD model and the edge differentiation layer. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets have demonstrated the effectiveness of ISG-CD.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we introduce "Abductive Past Action Inference", a novel research task aimed at identifying the past actions performed by individuals within homes to reach specific states captured in a single image, using abductive inference. The research explores three key abductive inference problems: past action set prediction, past action sequence prediction, and abductive past action verification. We introduce several models tailored for abductive past action inference, including a relational graph neural network, a relational bilinear pooling model, and a relational transformer model. Notably, the newly proposed object-relational bilinear graph encoder-decoder (BiGED) model emerges as the most effective among all methods evaluated, demonstrating good proficiency in handling the intricacies of the Action Genome dataset. The contributions of this research significantly advance the ability of deep learning models to reason about current scene evidence and make highly plausible inferences about past human actions. This advancement enables a deeper understanding of events and behaviors, which can enhance decision-making and improve system capabilities across various real-world applications such as Human-Robot Interaction and Elderly Care and Health Monitoring.

| **[A Unified Invariant Learning Framework for Graph Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12595v1)** | 2025-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Invariant learning demonstrates substantial potential for enhancing the generalization of graph neural networks (GNNs) with out-of-distribution (OOD) data. It aims to recognize stable features in graph data for classification, based on the premise that these features causally determine the target label, and their influence is invariant to changes in distribution. Along this line, most studies have attempted to pinpoint these stable features by emphasizing explicit substructures in the graph, such as masked or attentive subgraphs, and primarily enforcing the invariance principle in the semantic space, i.e., graph representations. However, we argue that focusing only on the semantic space may not accurately identify these stable features. To address this, we introduce the Unified Invariant Learning (UIL) framework for graph classification. It provides a unified perspective on invariant graph learning, emphasizing both structural and semantic invariance principles to identify more robust stable features. In the graph space, UIL adheres to the structural invariance principle by reducing the distance between graphons over a set of stable features across different environments. Simultaneously, to confirm semantic invariance, UIL underscores that the acquired graph representations should demonstrate exemplary performance across diverse environments. We present both theoretical and empirical evidence to confirm our method's ability to recognize superior stable features. Moreover, through a series of comprehensive experiments complemented by in-depth analyses, we demonstrate that UIL considerably enhances OOD generalization, surpassing the performance of leading baseline methods.

This model combines supervised and self-supervised learning, taking into account for the loss function the embeddings learned and patterns with and without ground truth. Additionally it incorporates an attention mechanism that leverages both node and edge features. The architecture, trained end-to-end, comprises two primary components: embedding generation and prediction. First, a graph neural network (GNN) transform raw node features into dense, low-dimensional embeddings, incorporating edge attributes. Then, a feedforward neural model processes the node embeddings to produce the final output. Experiments demonstrate that our model matches or exceeds existing methods for protein-protein interactions prediction and Gene Ontology (GO) terms prediction. The model also performs effectively with one-hot encoding for node features, providing a solution for the previously unsolved problem of predicting similarity between compounds with unknown structures.</p></details> |  |

This classification not only supports educational diagnostics and analytics but also enhances complex tasks like information retrieval and question answering by associating questions with relevant categories. Traditional methods, often based on word embeddings and conventional classifiers, struggle to capture the nuanced relationships in natural language, leading to suboptimal performance. To address this, we propose a novel approach leveraging graph convolutional networks, named Phrase Question-Graph Convolutional Network (PQ-GCN) to better model the inherent structure of questions. By representing questions as graphs-where nodes signify words or phrases and edges denote syntactic or semantic relationships-our method allows the model to learn from the interconnected nature of language more effectively. Additionally, we explore the incorporation of phrase-based features to enhance classification performance on question datasets of various domains and characteristics. Our findings demonstrate that the proposed model, augmented with these features, offer a promising solution for more robust and context-aware question classification, bridging the gap between graph neural network research and practical educational applications of AI.</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces a novel SVGS-DSGAT model that combines GraphSage, SVAM, and DSGAT modules, enhancing feature extraction and target detection capabilities through graph neural networks and attention mechanisms. The model integrates IoT technology to facilitate real-time data collection and processing, optimizing resource allocation and model responsiveness. Experimental results demonstrate that the SVGS-DSGAT model achieves an mAP of 40.8% on the URPC 2020 dataset and 41.5% on the SeaDronesSee dataset, significantly outperforming existing mainstream models. This IoT-enhanced approach not only excels in high-noise and complex backgrounds but also improves the overall efficiency and scalability of the system.

HIL simulation platforms enable the integration of computational models with physical devices, allowing rigorous testing across diverse scenarios critical to system resilience and reliability. In this study, we develop a SafePowerGraph-HIL framework that utilizes HIL simulations on the IEEE 9-bus system, modeled in Hypersim, to generate high-fidelity data, which is then transmitted in real-time via SCADA to an AWS cloud database before being input into a Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network (HGNN) model designed for power system state estimation and dynamic analysis. By leveraging Hypersim's capabilities, we simulate complex grid interactions, providing a robust dataset that captures critical parameters for HGNN training. The trained HGNN is subsequently validated using newly generated data under varied system conditions, demonstrating accuracy and robustness in predicting power system states. The results underscore the potential of integrating HIL with advanced neural network architectures to enhance the real-time operational capabilities of power systems. This approach represents a significant advancement toward the development of intelligent, adaptive control strategies that support the robustness and resilience of evolving power grids.</p></details> | 5 pages, 5 figures |

| **[Training Graph Neural Networks Using Non-Robust Samples](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14738v6)** | 2025-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are a highly effective neural network architecture for processing graph -- structured data. Unlike traditional neural networks that rely solely on the features of the data as input, GNNs leverage both the graph structure, which represents the relationships between data points, and the feature matrix of the data to optimize their feature representation. This unique capability enables GNNs to achieve superior performance across various tasks. However, it also makes GNNs more susceptible to noise from both the graph structure and data features, which can significantly increase the training difficulty and degrade their performance. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel method for selecting noise-sensitive training samples from the original training set to construct a smaller yet more effective training set for model training. These samples are used to help improve the model's ability to correctly process data in noisy environments. We have evaluated our approach on three of the most classical GNN models -- GCN, GAT, and GraphSAGE -- as well as three widely used benchmark datasets: Cora, Citeseer, and PubMed. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can substantially boost the training of Graph Neural Networks compared to using randomly sampled training sets of the same size from the original training set and the larger original full training set.</p></details> |  |

To this end, the existing methods either focused on the lightweight embeddings for both users and items, or involved on-device systems enjoying the compact embeddings to enhance reusability and reduces space complexity. However, they focus solely on the coarse granularity of embedding, while overlook the fine-grained semantic nuances, to adversarially downgrade the efficacy of meta-embeddings in capturing the intricate relationship over both user and item, consequently resulting into the suboptimal recommendations. In this paper, we aim to study how the meta-embedding can efficiently learn varied grained semantics, together with how the fine-grained meta-embedding can strengthen the representation of coarse-grained meta-embedding. To answer these questions, we develop a novel graph neural networks (GNNs) based recommender where each user and item serves as the node, linked directly to coarse-grained virtual nodes and indirectly to fine-grained virtual nodes, ensuring different grained semantic learning, while disclosing: 1) In contrast to coarse-grained semantics, fine-grained semantics are well captured through sparse meta-embeddings, which adaptively 2) balance the embedding uniqueness and memory constraint. Additionally, the initialization method come up upon SparsePCA, along with a soft thresholding activation function to render the sparseness of the meta-embeddings. We propose a weight bridging update strategy that focuses on matching each coarse-grained meta-embedding with several fine-grained meta-embeddings based on the users/items' semantics. Extensive experiments substantiate our method's superiority over existing baselines. Our code is available at https://github.com/htyjers/C2F-MetaEmbed.</p></details> | 16 pages, 6 figures |

Spatio-temporal models combining mobility data with machine learning have gained attention for disease forecasting. Here, we explore Graph Convolutional Recurrent Network (GCRN) and Graph Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (GCLSTM), which combine the power of Graph Neural Networks (GNN) with traditional architectures that deal with sequential data. The aim is to forecast future values of COVID-19 cases in Brazil and China by leveraging human mobility networks, whose nodes represent geographical locations and links are flows of vehicles or people. We show that employing backbone extraction to filter out negligible connections in the mobility network enhances predictive stability. Comparing regression and classification tasks demonstrates that binary classification yields smoother, more interpretable results. Interestingly, we observe qualitatively equivalent results for both Brazil and China datasets by introducing sliding windows of variable size and prediction horizons. Compared to prior studies, introducing the sliding window and the network backbone extraction strategies yields improvements of about 80% in root mean squared errors.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph Defense Diffusion Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11568v1)** | 2025-01-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) demonstrate significant potential in various applications but remain highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks, which can greatly degrade their performance. Existing graph purification methods attempt to address this issue by filtering attacked graphs; however, they struggle to effectively defend against multiple types of adversarial attacks simultaneously due to their limited flexibility, and they lack comprehensive modeling of graph data due to their heavy reliance on heuristic prior knowledge. To overcome these challenges, we propose a more versatile approach for defending against adversarial attacks on graphs. In this work, we introduce the Graph Defense Diffusion Model (GDDM), a flexible purification method that leverages the denoising and modeling capabilities of diffusion models. The iterative nature of diffusion models aligns well with the stepwise process of adversarial attacks, making them particularly suitable for defense. By iteratively adding and removing noise, GDDM effectively purifies attacked graphs, restoring their original structure and features. Our GDDM consists of two key components: (1) Graph Structure-Driven Refiner, which preserves the basic fidelity of the graph during the denoising process, and ensures that the generated graph remains consistent with the original scope; and (2) Node Feature-Constrained Regularizer, which removes residual impurities from the denoised graph, further enhances the purification effect. Additionally, we design tailored denoising strategies to handle different types of adversarial attacks, improving the model's adaptability to various attack scenarios. Extensive experiments conducted on three real-world datasets demonstrate that GDDM outperforms state-of-the-art methods in defending against a wide range of adversarial attacks, showcasing its robustness and effectiveness.</p></details> | 13 pages,5 figures |
| **[UniGraph: Learning a Unified Cross-Domain Foundation Model for Text-Attributed Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13630v3)** | 2025-01-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models like ChatGPT and GPT-4 have revolutionized artificial intelligence, exhibiting remarkable abilities to generalize across a wide array of tasks and applications beyond their initial training objectives. However, graph learning has predominantly focused on single-graph models, tailored to specific tasks or datasets, lacking the ability to transfer learned knowledge to different domains. This limitation stems from the inherent complexity and diversity of graph structures, along with the different feature and label spaces specific to graph data. In this paper, we recognize text as an effective unifying medium and employ Text-Attributed Graphs (TAGs) to leverage this potential. We present our UniGraph framework, designed to learn a foundation model for TAGs, which is capable of generalizing to unseen graphs and tasks across diverse domains. Unlike single-graph models that use pre-computed node features of varying dimensions as input, our approach leverages textual features for unifying node representations, even for graphs such as molecular graphs that do not naturally have textual features. We propose a novel cascaded architecture of Language Models (LMs) and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) as backbone networks. Additionally, we propose the first pre-training algorithm specifically designed for large-scale self-supervised learning on TAGs, based on Masked Graph Modeling. We introduce graph instruction tuning using Large Language Models (LLMs) to enable zero-shot prediction ability. Our comprehensive experiments across various graph learning tasks and domains demonstrate the model's effectiveness in self-supervised representation learning on unseen graphs, few-shot in-context transfer, and zero-shot transfer, even surpassing or matching the performance of GNNs that have undergone supervised training on target datasets.</p></details> | KDD 2025 |
| **[Graph neural networks informed locally by thermodynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13093v2)** | 2025-01-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Thermodynamics-informed neural networks employ inductive biases for the enforcement of the first and second principles of thermodynamics. To construct these biases, a metriplectic evolution of the system is assumed. This provides excellent results, when compared to uninformed, black box networks. While the degree of accuracy can be increased in one or two orders of magnitude, in the case of graph networks, this requires assembling global Poisson and dissipation matrices, which breaks the local structure of such networks. In order to avoid this drawback, a local version of the metriplectic biases has been developed in this work, which avoids the aforementioned matrix assembly, thus preserving the node-by-node structure of the graph networks. We apply this framework for examples in the fields of solid and fluid mechanics. Our approach demonstrates significant computational efficiency and strong generalization capabilities, accurately making inferences on examples significantly different from those encountered during training.</p></details> |  |

In contrast, multi-party dialogues involve more participants, each potentially discussing different topics, making the task more complex. Current methods often rely on graph neural networks to model dialogue context, which helps capture the structural dynamics of multi-party conversations. However, these methods are heavily dependent on intricate graph structures and dataset annotations, and they often overlook the distinct speaking styles of participants. To address these challenges, we propose CMR, a Contrastive learning-based Multi-party dialogue Response generation model. CMR uses self-supervised contrastive learning to better distinguish "who says what." Additionally, by comparing speakers within the same conversation, the model captures differences in speaking styles and thematic transitions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first approach to apply contrastive learning in multi-party dialogue generation. Experimental results show that CMR significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models in multi-party dialogue response tasks.</p></details> |  |

Traditional methods of air quality monitoring, such as ground-based sensors and satellite-based remote sensing, face limitations due to high deployment costs, sparse sensor coverage, and environmental interferences. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a framework for high-resolution spatiotemporal Air Quality Index (AQI) mapping using sparse sensor data, satellite imagery, and various spatiotemporal factors. By leveraging Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), we estimate AQI values at unmonitored locations based on both spatial and temporal dependencies. The framework incorporates a wide range of environmental features, including meteorological data, road networks, points of interest (PoIs), population density, and urban green spaces, which enhance prediction accuracy. We illustrate the use of our approach through a case study in Lahore, Pakistan, where multi-resolution data is used to generate the air quality index map at a fine spatiotemporal scale.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fast instance-specific algorithm configuration with graph neural network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11240v1)** | 2025-01-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Combinatorial optimization (CO) problems are pivotal across various industrial applications, where the speed of solving these problems is crucial. Improving the performance of CO solvers across diverse input instances requires fine-tuning solver parameters for each instance. However, this tuning process is time-consuming, and the time required increases with the number of instances. To address this, a method called instance-specific algorithm configuration (ISAC) has been devised. This approach involves two main steps: training and execution. During the training step, features are extracted from various instances and then grouped into clusters. For each cluster, parameters are fine-tuned. This cluster-specific tuning process results in a set of generalized parameters for instances belonging to each class. In the execution step, features are extracted from an unknown instance to determine its cluster, and the corresponding pre-tuned parameters are applied. Generally, the running time of a solver is evaluated by the time to solution ($TTS$). However, methods like ISAC require preprocessing. Therefore, the total execution time is $T_{tot}=TTS+T_{tune}$, where $T_{tune}$ represents the tuning time. While the goal is to minimize $T_{tot}$, it is important to note that extracting features in the ISAC method requires a certain amount of computational time. The extracting features include summary statistics of the solver execution logs, which takes several 10 seconds. This research presents a method to significantly reduce the time of the ISAC execution step by streamlining feature extraction and class determination with a graph neural network. Experimental results show that $T_{tune}$ in the execution step, which take several 10 seconds in the original ISAC manner, could be reduced to sub-seconds.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mitigating Spatial Disparity in Urban Prediction Using Residual-Aware Spatiotemporal Graph Neural Networks: A Chicago Case Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11214v1)** | 2025-01-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Urban prediction tasks, such as forecasting traffic flow, temperature, and crime rates, are crucial for efficient urban planning and management. However, existing Spatiotemporal Graph Neural Networks (ST-GNNs) often rely solely on accuracy, overlooking spatial and demographic disparities in their predictions. This oversight can lead to imbalanced resource allocation and exacerbate existing inequities in urban areas. This study introduces a Residual-Aware Attention (RAA) Block and an equality-enhancing loss function to address these disparities. By adapting the adjacency matrix during training and incorporating spatial disparity metrics, our approach aims to reduce local segregation of residuals and errors. We applied our methodology to urban prediction tasks in Chicago, utilizing a travel demand dataset as an example. Our model achieved a 48% significant improvement in fairness metrics with only a 9% increase in error metrics. Spatial analysis of residual distributions revealed that models with RAA Blocks produced more equitable prediction results, particularly by reducing errors clustered in central regions. Attention maps demonstrated the model's ability to dynamically adjust focus, leading to more balanced predictions. Case studies of various community areas in Chicago further illustrated the effectiveness of our approach in addressing spatial and demographic disparities, supporting more balanced and equitable urban planning and policy-making.</p></details> |  |
| **[Achieving Network Resilience through Graph Neural Network-enabled Deep Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11074v1)** | 2025-01-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has been widely used in many important tasks of communication networks. In order to improve the perception ability of DRL on the network, some studies have combined graph neural networks (GNNs) with DRL, which use the GNNs to extract unstructured features of the network. However, as networks continue to evolve and become increasingly complex, existing GNN-DRL methods still face challenges in terms of scalability and robustness. Moreover, these methods are inadequate for addressing network security issues. From the perspective of security and robustness, this paper explores the solution of combining GNNs with DRL to build a resilient network. This article starts with a brief tutorial of GNNs and DRL, and introduces their existing applications in networks. Furthermore, we introduce the network security methods that can be strengthened by GNN-DRL approaches. Then, we designed a framework based on GNN-DRL to defend against attacks and enhance network resilience. Additionally, we conduct a case study using an encrypted traffic dataset collected from real IoT environments, and the results demonstrated the effectiveness and superiority of our framework. Finally, we highlight key open challenges and opportunities for enhancing network resilience with GNN-DRL.</p></details> |  |
| **[Machine Learning Surrogates for Optimizing Transportation Policies with Agent-Based Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11057v1)** | 2025-01-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Rapid urbanization and growing urban populations worldwide present significant challenges for cities, including increased traffic congestion and air pollution. Effective strategies are needed to manage traffic volumes and reduce emissions. In practice, traditional traffic flow simulations are used to test those strategies. However, high computational intensity usually limits their applicability in investigating a magnitude of different scenarios to evaluate best policies. This paper presents a first approach of using Graph Neural Networks (GNN) as surrogates for large-scale agent-based simulation models. In a case study using the MATSim model of Paris, the GNN effectively learned the impacts of capacity reduction policies on citywide traffic flow. Performance analysis across various road types and scenarios revealed that the GNN could accurately capture policy-induced effects on edge-based traffic volumes, particularly on roads directly affected by the policies and those with higher traffic volumes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Image Segmentation: Inducing graph-based learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03765v2)** | 2025-01-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study explores the potential of graph neural networks (GNNs) to enhance semantic segmentation across diverse image modalities. We evaluate the effectiveness of a novel GNN-based U-Net architecture on three distinct datasets: PascalVOC, a standard benchmark for natural image segmentation, WoodScape, a challenging dataset of fisheye images commonly used in autonomous driving, introducing significant geometric distortions; and ISIC2016, a dataset of dermoscopic images for skin lesion segmentation. We compare our proposed UNet-GNN model against established convolutional neural networks (CNNs) based segmentation models, including U-Net and U-Net++, as well as the transformer-based SwinUNet. Unlike these methods, which primarily rely on local convolutional operations or global self-attention, GNNs explicitly model relationships between image regions by constructing and operating on a graph representation of the image features. This approach allows the model to capture long-range dependencies and complex spatial relationships, which we hypothesize will be particularly beneficial for handling geometric distortions present in fisheye imagery and capturing intricate boundaries in medical images. Our analysis demonstrates the versatility of GNNs in addressing diverse segmentation challenges and highlights their potential to improve segmentation accuracy in various applications, including autonomous driving and medical image analysis.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph neural network for in-network placement of real-time metaverse tasks in next-generation network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01780v2)** | 2025-01-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study addresses the challenge of real-time metaverse applications by proposing an in-network placement and task-offloading solution for delay-constrained computing tasks in next-generation networks. The metaverse, envisioned as a parallel virtual world, requires seamless real-time experiences across diverse applications. The study introduces a software-defined networking (SDN)-based architecture and employs graph neural network (GNN) techniques for intelligent and adaptive task allocation in in-network computing (INC). Considering time constraints and computing capabilities, the proposed model optimally decides whether to offload rendering tasks to INC nodes or edge server. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed GNN model, achieving 97% accuracy compared to 72% for multilayer perceptron (MLP) and 70% for decision trees (DTs). The study fills the research gap in in-network placement for real-time metaverse applications, offering insights into efficient rendering task handling.</p></details> |  |
| **[GRID: Protecting Training Graph from Link Stealing Attacks on GNN Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10985v1)** | 2025-01-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) have exhibited superior performance in various classification tasks on graph-structured data. However, they encounter the potential vulnerability from the link stealing attacks, which can infer the presence of a link between two nodes via measuring the similarity of its incident nodes' prediction vectors produced by a GNN model. Such attacks pose severe security and privacy threats to the training graph used in GNN models. In this work, we propose a novel solution, called Graph Link Disguise (GRID), to defend against link stealing attacks with the formal guarantee of GNN model utility for retaining prediction accuracy. The key idea of GRID is to add carefully crafted noises to the nodes' prediction vectors for disguising adjacent nodes as n-hop indirect neighboring nodes. We take into account the graph topology and select only a subset of nodes (called core nodes) covering all links for adding noises, which can avert the noises offset and have the further advantages of reducing both the distortion loss and the computation cost. Our crafted noises can ensure 1) the noisy prediction vectors of any two adjacent nodes have their similarity level like that of two non-adjacent nodes and 2) the model prediction is unchanged to ensure zero utility loss. Extensive experiments on five datasets are conducted to show the effectiveness of our proposed GRID solution against different representative link-stealing attacks under transductive settings and inductive settings respectively, as well as two influence-based attacks. Meanwhile, it achieves a much better privacy-utility trade-off than existing methods when extended to GNNs.</p></details> |  |
| **[UDC: A Unified Neural Divide-and-Conquer Framework for Large-Scale Combinatorial Optimization Problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00312v4)** | 2025-01-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Single-stage neural combinatorial optimization solvers have achieved near-optimal results on various small-scale combinatorial optimization (CO) problems without requiring expert knowledge. However, these solvers exhibit significant performance degradation when applied to large-scale CO problems. Recently, two-stage neural methods motivated by divide-and-conquer strategies have shown efficiency in addressing large-scale CO problems. Nevertheless, the performance of these methods highly relies on problem-specific heuristics in either the dividing or the conquering procedure, which limits their applicability to general CO problems. Moreover, these methods employ separate training schemes and ignore the interdependencies between the dividing and conquering strategies, often leading to sub-optimal solutions. To tackle these drawbacks, this article develops a unified neural divide-and-conquer framework (i.e., UDC) for solving general large-scale CO problems. UDC offers a Divide-Conquer-Reunion (DCR) training method to eliminate the negative impact of a sub-optimal dividing policy. Employing a high-efficiency Graph Neural Network (GNN) for global instance dividing and a fixed-length sub-path solver for conquering divided sub-problems, the proposed UDC framework demonstrates extensive applicability, achieving superior performance in 10 representative large-scale CO problems. The code is available at https://github.com/CIAM-Group/NCO_code/tree/main/single_objective/UDC-Large-scale-CO-master.</p></details> |  |

Graph Neural Networks (GNN) have performed remarkably well across diverse domains because they can represent complex relationships via unstructured graphs. However, the applicability of GNNs for visual tasks was unexplored till the introduction of Vision GNNs (ViG). Despite the success of ViGs, their performance is severely bottlenecked due to the expensive $k$-Nearest Neighbors ($k$-NN) based graph construction. Recent works addressing this bottleneck impose constraints on the flexibility of GNNs to build unstructured graphs, undermining their core advantage while introducing additional inefficiencies. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose a novel method called Dynamic Efficient Graph Convolution (DEGC) for designing efficient and globally aware ViGs. DEGC partitions the input image and constructs graphs in parallel for each partition, improving graph construction efficiency. Further, DEGC integrates local intra-graph and global inter-graph feature learning, enabling enhanced global context awareness. Using DEGC as a building block, we propose a novel CNN-GNN architecture, ClusterViG, for CV tasks. Extensive experiments indicate that ClusterViG reduces end-to-end inference latency for vision tasks by up to $5\times$ when compared against a suite of models such as ViG, ViHGNN, PVG, and GreedyViG, with a similar model parameter count. Additionally, ClusterViG reaches state-of-the-art performance on image classification, object detection, and instance segmentation tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed globally aware learning strategy. Finally, input partitioning performed by DEGC enables ClusterViG to be trained efficiently on higher-resolution images, underscoring the scalability of our approach.</p></details> | Preprint |
| **[High-Rank Irreducible Cartesian Tensor Decomposition and Bases of Equivariant Spaces](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18263v4)** | 2025-01-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Irreducible Cartesian tensors (ICTs) play a crucial role in the design of equivariant graph neural networks, as well as in theoretical chemistry and chemical physics. Meanwhile, the design space of available linear operations on tensors that preserve symmetry presents a significant challenge. The ICT decomposition and a basis of this equivariant space are difficult to obtain for high-rank tensors. After decades of research, Bonvicini (2024) recently achieves an explicit ICT decomposition for $n=5$ with factorial time/space complexity. In this work we, for the first time, obtains decomposition matrices for ICTs up to rank $n=9$ with reduced and affordable complexity, by constructing what we call path matrices. The path matrices are obtained via performing chain-like contractions with Clebsch-Gordan matrices following the parentage scheme. We prove and leverage that the concatenation of path matrices is an orthonormal change-of-basis matrix between the Cartesian tensor product space and the spherical direct sum spaces. Furthermore, we identify a complete orthogonal basis for the equivariant space, rather than a spanning set (Pearce-Crump, 2023), through this path matrices technique. To the best of our knowledge, this is also the first analytic, rather than numerical, method for theoretically obtaining arbitrary rank orthogonal ICT decomposition matrices and orthogonal equivariant bases. We further extend our result to the arbitrary tensor product and direct sum spaces, enabling free design between different spaces while keeping symmetry. The Python code is available at https://github.com/ShihaoShao-GH/ICT-decomposition-and-equivariant-bases, where the $n=6,\dots,9$ ICT decomposition matrices are obtained in 1s, 3s, 11s, and 4m32s on 28-cores Intel(R) Xeon(R) Gold 6330 CPU @ 2.00GHz, respectively.</p></details> | 47 pages |

Our method integrates the foundation models CLIPSeg and Segment Anything Model (SAM) with the interest point detector SuperPoint and a graph convolutional network (GCN) to accurately segment machinery parts.

| **[Virtual Nodes Improve Long-term Traffic Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10048v1)** | 2025-01-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Effective traffic prediction is a cornerstone of intelligent transportation systems, enabling precise forecasts of traffic flow, speed, and congestion. While traditional spatio-temporal graph neural networks (ST-GNNs) have achieved notable success in short-term traffic forecasting, their performance in long-term predictions remains limited. This challenge arises from over-squashing problem, where bottlenecks and limited receptive fields restrict information flow and hinder the modeling of global dependencies. To address these challenges, this study introduces a novel framework that incorporates virtual nodes, which are additional nodes added to the graph and connected to existing nodes, in order to aggregate information across the entire graph within a single GNN layer. Our proposed model incorporates virtual nodes by constructing a semi-adaptive adjacency matrix. This matrix integrates distance-based and adaptive adjacency matrices, allowing the model to leverage geographical information while also learning task-specific features from data. Experimental results demonstrate that the inclusion of virtual nodes significantly enhances long-term prediction accuracy while also improving layer-wise sensitivity to mitigate the over-squashing problem. Virtual nodes also offer enhanced explainability by focusing on key intersections and high-traffic areas, as shown by the visualization of their adjacency matrix weights on road network heat maps. Our advanced approach enhances the understanding and management of urban traffic systems, making it particularly well-suited for real-world applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Benchmarking Graph Representations and Graph Neural Networks for Multivariate Time Series Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08305v2)** | 2025-01-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multivariate Time Series Classification (MTSC) enables the analysis if complex temporal data, and thus serves as a cornerstone in various real-world applications, ranging from healthcare to finance. Since the relationship among variables in MTS usually contain crucial cues, a large number of graph-based MTSC approaches have been proposed, as the graph topology and edges can explicitly represent relationships among variables (channels), where not only various MTS graph representation learning strategies but also different Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been explored. Despite such progresses, there is no comprehensive study that fairly benchmarks and investigates the performances of existing widely-used graph representation learning strategies/GNN classifiers in the application of different MTSC tasks. In this paper, we present the first benchmark which systematically investigates the effectiveness of the widely-used three node feature definition strategies, four edge feature learning strategies and five GNN architecture, resulting in 60 different variants for graph-based MTSC. These variants are developed and evaluated with a standardized data pipeline and training/validation/testing strategy on 26 widely-used suspensor MTSC datasets. Our experiments highlight that node features significantly influence MTSC performance, while the visualization of edge features illustrates why adaptive edge learning outperforms other edge feature learning methods. The code of the proposed benchmark is publicly available at \url{https://github.com/CVI-yangwn/Benchmark-GNN-for-Multivariate-Time-Series-Classification}.</p></details> |  |
| **[RELIEF: Reinforcement Learning Empowered Graph Feature Prompt Tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03195v3)** | 2025-01-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The advent of the "pre-train, prompt" paradigm has recently extended its generalization ability and data efficiency to graph representation learning, following its achievements in Natural Language Processing (NLP). Initial graph prompt tuning approaches tailored specialized prompting functions for Graph Neural Network (GNN) models pre-trained with specific strategies, such as edge prediction, thus limiting their applicability. In contrast, another pioneering line of research has explored universal prompting via adding prompts to the input graph's feature space, thereby removing the reliance on specific pre-training strategies. However, the necessity to add feature prompts to all nodes remains an open question. Motivated by findings from prompt tuning research in the NLP domain, which suggest that highly capable pre-trained models need less conditioning signal to achieve desired behaviors, we advocate for strategically incorporating necessary and lightweight feature prompts to certain graph nodes to enhance downstream task performance. This introduces a combinatorial optimization problem, requiring a policy to decide 1) which nodes to prompt and 2) what specific feature prompts to attach. We then address the problem by framing the prompt incorporation process as a sequential decision-making problem and propose our method, RELIEF, which employs Reinforcement Learning (RL) to optimize it. At each step, the RL agent selects a node (discrete action) and determines the prompt content (continuous action), aiming to maximize cumulative performance gain. Extensive experiments on graph and node-level tasks with various pre-training strategies in few-shot scenarios demonstrate that our RELIEF outperforms fine-tuning and other prompt-based approaches in classification performance and data efficiency.

Rao-Wilton-Glisson (RWG) basis functions are employed to discretely and accurately represent the geometry of 3D conducting bodies. A concise and informative graph representation is then constructed by treating each RWG function as a node in the graph, enabling the flow of current between nodes. With the transformed graphs, GraphSolver is developed to directly predict real and imaginary parts of the x, y and z components of the surface current densities at each node (RWG function). Numerical results demonstrate the efficacy of GraphSolver in solving CFIEs for 3D conducting bodies with varying levels of geometric complexity, including basic 3D targets, missile-shaped targets, and airplane-shaped targets.</p></details> | 10 pages,11 figures |

By leveraging a Bayesian non-parametric framework, BN-Pool employs a generative model capable of partitioning graph nodes into an unbounded number of clusters. During training, we learn the node-to-cluster assignments by combining the supervised loss of the downstream task with an unsupervised auxiliary term, which encourages the reconstruction of the original graph topology while penalizing unnecessary proliferation of clusters. This adaptive strategy allows BN-Pool to automatically discover an optimal coarsening level, offering enhanced flexibility and removing the need to specify sensitive pooling ratios. We show that BN-Pool achieves superior performance across diverse benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

One common approach is to use Dijkstra's Algorithm, which produces the shortest path as well as the shortest distance. However, this option is computationally expensive when applied to large-scale networks. This paper proposes a novel fast framework based on graph neural networks (GNNs) which approximate the single-source shortest distance between pairs of locations, and predict the single-source shortest path subsequently. We conduct multiple experiments on synthetic graphs of different size to demonstrate the feasibility and computational efficiency of the proposed model. In real-world case studies, we also applied the proposed method of flood risk analysis of coastal urban areas to calculate delays in evacuation to public shelters during hurricanes. The results indicate the accuracy and computational efficiency of the GNN model, and its potential for effective implementation in emergency planning and management.</p></details> | 17 pages, 11 figures |

However, unlike GNNs, FMs struggle to incorporate node features and generalise to unseen nodes in inductive settings. Our work bridges the gap between FMs and GNNs by proposing ReFactor GNNs. This new architecture draws upon both modelling paradigms, which previously were largely thought of as disjoint. Concretely, using a message-passing formalism, we show how FMs can be cast as GNNs by reformulating the gradient descent procedure as message-passing operations, which forms the basis of our ReFactor GNNs. Across a multitude of well-established KGC benchmarks, our ReFactor GNNs achieve comparable transductive performance to FMs, and state-of-the-art inductive performance while using an order of magnitude fewer parameters.</p></details> | <details><summary>36th ...</summary><p>36th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2022)</p></details> |

Despite their great success, existing works primarily employ polynomial approximation to construct the filters, whereas another superior option, namely ration approximation, remains underexplored. Although a handful of prior works have attempted to deploy the rational approximation, their implementations often involve intensive computational demands or still resort to polynomial approximations, hindering full potential of the rational graph filters. To address the issues, this paper introduces ERGNN, a novel spectral GNN with explicitly-optimized rational filter. ERGNN adopts a unique two-step framework that sequentially applies the numerator filter and the denominator filter to the input signals, thus streamlining the model paradigm while enabling explicit optimization of both numerator and denominator of the rational filter. Extensive experiments validate the superiority of ERGNN over state-of-the-art methods, establishing it as a practical solution for deploying rational-based GNNs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in 2025 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing, ICASSP 2025</p></details> |
| **[Fast Searching of Extreme Operating Conditions for Relay Protection Setting Calculation Based on Graph Neural Network and Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09399v1)** | 2025-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Searching for the Extreme Operating Conditions (EOCs) is one of the core problems of power system relay protection setting calculation. The current methods based on brute-force search, heuristic algorithms, and mathematical programming can hardly meet the requirements of today's power systems in terms of computation speed due to the drastic changes in operating conditions induced by renewables and power electronics. This paper proposes an EOC fast search method, named Graph Dueling Double Deep Q Network (Graph D3QN), which combines graph neural network and deep reinforcement learning to address this challenge. First, the EOC search problem is modeled as a Markov decision process, where the information of the underlying power system is extracted using graph neural networks, so that the EOC of the system can be found via deep reinforcement learning. Then, a two-stage Guided Learning and Free Exploration (GLFE) training framework is constructed to accelerate the convergence speed of reinforcement learning. Finally, the proposed Graph D3QN method is validated through case studies of searching maximum fault current for relay protection setting calculation on the IEEE 39-bus and 118-bus systems. The experimental results demonstrate that Graph D3QN can reduce the computation time by 10 to 1000 times while guaranteeing the accuracy of the selected EOCs.</p></details> | 10 pages, 9 figures |

Previous research has primarily focused on finding appropriate graph filters (e.g. aggregation methods) to perform well on both homophilic and heterophilic graphs. While these methods are effective, they can still suffer from the sparsity of node features, where the initial data contain few non-zero elements. This can lead to overfitting in certain dimensions in the first projection matrix, as training samples may not cover the entire range of graph filters (hyperplanes). To address this, we propose a novel data augmentation strategy. Specifically, by flipping both the initial features and hyperplane, we create additional space for training, which leads to more precise updates of the learnable parameters and improved robustness for unseen features during inference. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to mitigate the overfitting caused by the initial features. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show that our proposed technique increases node classification accuracy by up to 46.5% relatively.</p></details> |  |
| **[Smoothness Really Matters: A Simple Yet Effective Approach for Unsupervised Graph Domain Adaptation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11654v3)** | 2025-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unsupervised Graph Domain Adaptation (UGDA) seeks to bridge distribution shifts between domains by transferring knowledge from labeled source graphs to given unlabeled target graphs. Existing UGDA methods primarily focus on aligning features in the latent space learned by graph neural networks (GNNs) across domains, often overlooking structural shifts, resulting in limited effectiveness when addressing structurally complex transfer scenarios. Given the sensitivity of GNNs to local structural features, even slight discrepancies between source and target graphs could lead to significant shifts in node embeddings, thereby reducing the effectiveness of knowledge transfer. To address this issue, we introduce a novel approach for UGDA called Target-Domain Structural Smoothing (TDSS). TDSS is a simple and effective method designed to perform structural smoothing directly on the target graph, thereby mitigating structural distribution shifts and ensuring the consistency of node representations. Specifically, by integrating smoothing techniques with neighborhood sampling, TDSS maintains the structural coherence of the target graph while mitigating the risk of over-smoothing. Our theoretical analysis shows that TDSS effectively reduces target risk by improving model smoothness. Empirical results on three real-world datasets demonstrate that TDSS outperforms recent state-of-the-art baselines, achieving significant improvements across six transfer scenarios. The code is available in https://github.com/cwei01/TDSS.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, Accpected by AAAI2025</p></details> |

Graph neural networks, the dominant approach for graph representation learning, are limited in their representation power. Therefore, it can be beneficial to explicitly extract and incorporate high-order topological and geometric information into these models. In this paper, we propose a principled approach to extract the rich connectivity information of graphs based on the theory of persistent homology. Our method utilizes the topological features to enhance the representation learning of graph neural networks and achieve state-of-the-art performance on various node classification and link prediction benchmarks. We also explore the option of end-to-end learning of the topological features, i.e., treating topological computation as a differentiable operator during learning. Our theoretical analysis and empirical study provide insights and potential guidelines for employing topological features in graph learning tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in JMLR 2025</p></details> |

In our research, we develop an innovative surrogate model for a traffic assignment when multi-class vehicles are involved. We do so by employing heterogeneous graph neural networks which use a multiple-view graph attention mechanism tailored to different vehicle classes, along with additional links connecting origin-destination pairs. We also integrate the node-based flow conservation law into the loss function. As a result, our model adheres to flow conservation while delivering highly accurate predictions for link flows and utilization ratios. Through numerical experiments conducted on urban transportation networks, we demonstrate that our model surpasses traditional neural network approaches in convergence speed and predictive accuracy in both user equilibrium and system optimal versions of traffic assignment.</p></details> | 16 pages, 5 figures |

We introduce Similarity-Quantized Relative Learning (SQRL), a learning framework that reformulates molecular activity prediction as relative difference learning between structurally similar pairs of compounds. SQRL uses precomputed molecular similarities to enhance training of graph neural networks and other architectures, and significantly improves accuracy and generalization in low-data regimes common in drug discovery. We demonstrate its broad applicability and real-world potential through benchmarking on public datasets as well as proprietary industry data. Our findings demonstrate that leveraging similarity-aware relative differences provides an effective paradigm for molecular activity prediction.</p></details> |  |

We introduce CrystalGRW, a diffusion-based generative model on Riemannian manifolds that proposes novel crystal configurations and can predict stable phases validated by density functional theory. The crystal properties, such as fractional coordinates, atomic types, and lattice matrices, are represented on suitable Riemannian manifolds, ensuring that new predictions generated through the diffusion process preserve the periodicity of crystal structures. We incorporate an equivariant graph neural network to also account for rotational and translational symmetries during the generation process. CrystalGRW demonstrates the ability to generate realistic crystal structures that are close to their ground states with accuracy comparable to existing models, while also enabling conditional control, such as specifying a desired crystallographic point group. These features help accelerate materials discovery and inverse design by offering stable, symmetry-consistent crystal candidates for experimental validation.</p></details> | <details><summary>10+12...</summary><p>10+12 pages, 10 figures</p></details> |
| **[Joint Detection and Decoding: A Graph Neural Network Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08871v1)** | 2025-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Narrowing the performance gap between optimal and feasible detection in inter-symbol interference (ISI) channels, this paper proposes to use graph neural networks (GNNs) for detection that can also be used to perform joint detection and decoding (JDD). For detection, the GNN is build upon the factor graph representations of the channel, while for JDD, the factor graph is expanded by the Tanner graph of the parity-check matrix (PCM) of the channel code, sharing the variable nodes (VNs). A particularly advantageous property of the GNN is a) the robustness against cycles in the factor graphs which is the main problem for sum-product algorithm (SPA)-based detection, and b) the robustness against channel state information (CSI) uncertainty at the receiver. Additionally, we propose using an input embedding resulting in a GNN independent of the channel impulse response (CIR). Consequently, a fully deep learning-based receiver enables joint optimization instead of individual optimization of the components, so-called end-to-end learning. Furthermore, we propose a parallel flooding schedule that also reduces the latency, which turns out to improve the error correcting performance. The proposed approach is analyzed and compared to state-of-the-art baselines for different modulations and codes in terms of error correcting capability and latency. The gain compared to SPA-based detection might be explained with improved messages between nodes and adaptive damping of messages. For a higher order modulation in a high-rate turbo detection and decoding (TDD) scenario the GNN shows a, at first glance, surprisingly high gain of 6.25 dB compared to the best, feasible non-neural baseline.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to Transactions on Communications. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2401.16187</p></details> |

To overcome this, we have developed GRAPPA - a hybrid graph neural network for predicting vapor pressures of pure components. GRAPPA enables the prediction of the vapor pressure curve of basically any organic molecule, requiring only the molecular structure as input. The new model consists of three parts: A graph attention network for the message passing step, a pooling function that captures long-range interactions, and a prediction head that yields the component-specific parameters of the Antoine equation, from which the vapor pressure can readily and consistently be calculated for any temperature. We have trained and evaluated GRAPPA on experimental vapor pressure data of almost 25,000 pure components. We found excellent prediction accuracy for unseen components, outperforming state-of-the-art group contribution methods and other machine learning approaches in applicability and accuracy. The trained model and its code are fully disclosed, and GRAPPA is directly applicable via the interactive website ml-prop.mv.rptu.de.</p></details> | 38 pages, 12 figures |

However, there is a noticeable absence of research on applying GNNs to supply chain networks. Supply chain networks are inherently graph-like in structure, making them prime candidates for applying GNN methodologies. This opens up a world of possibilities for optimizing, predicting, and solving even the most complex supply chain problems. A major setback in this approach lies in the absence of real-world benchmark datasets to facilitate the research and resolution of supply chain problems using GNNs. To address the issue, we present a real-world benchmark dataset for temporal tasks, obtained from one of the leading FMCG companies in Bangladesh, focusing on supply chain planning for production purposes. The dataset includes temporal data as node features to enable sales predictions, production planning, and the identification of factory issues. By utilizing this dataset, researchers can employ GNNs to address numerous supply chain problems, thereby advancing the field of supply chain analytics and planning.

| **[Dynamic Localisation of Spatial-Temporal Graph Neural Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04239v3)** | 2025-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial-temporal data, fundamental to many intelligent applications, reveals dependencies indicating causal links between present measurements at specific locations and historical data at the same or other locations. Within this context, adaptive spatial-temporal graph neural networks (ASTGNNs) have emerged as valuable tools for modelling these dependencies, especially through a data-driven approach rather than pre-defined spatial graphs. While this approach offers higher accuracy, it presents increased computational demands. Addressing this challenge, this paper delves into the concept of localisation within ASTGNNs, introducing an innovative perspective that spatial dependencies should be dynamically evolving over time. We introduce \textit{DynAGS}, a localised ASTGNN framework aimed at maximising efficiency and accuracy in distributed deployment. This framework integrates dynamic localisation, time-evolving spatial graphs, and personalised localisation, all orchestrated around the Dynamic Graph Generator, a light-weighted central module leveraging cross attention. The central module can integrate historical information in a node-independent manner to enhance the feature representation of nodes at the current moment. This improved feature representation is then used to generate a dynamic sparse graph without the need for costly data exchanges, and it supports personalised localisation. Performance assessments across two core ASTGNN architectures and nine real-world datasets from various applications reveal that \textit{DynAGS} outshines current benchmarks, underscoring that the dynamic modelling of spatial dependencies can drastically improve model expressibility, flexibility, and system efficiency, especially in distributed settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper was accepted by KDD'25</p></details> |
| **[Clarify Confused Nodes via Separated Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02285v5)** | 2025-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable advances in graph-oriented tasks. However, real-world graphs invariably contain a certain proportion of heterophilous nodes, challenging the homophily assumption of traditional GNNs and hindering their performance. Most existing studies continue to design generic models with shared weights between heterophilous and homophilous nodes. Despite the incorporation of high-order messages or multi-channel architectures, these efforts often fall short. A minority of studies attempt to train different node groups separately but suffer from inappropriate separation metrics and low efficiency. In this paper, we first propose a new metric, termed Neighborhood Confusion (NC), to facilitate a more reliable separation of nodes. We observe that node groups with different levels of NC values exhibit certain differences in intra-group accuracy and visualized embeddings. These pave the way for Neighborhood Confusion-guided Graph Convolutional Network (NCGCN), in which nodes are grouped by their NC values and accept intra-group weight sharing and message passing. Extensive experiments on both homophilous and heterophilous benchmarks demonstrate that our framework can effectively separate nodes and yield significant performance improvement compared to the latest methods.

However, most existing GNNs rely heavily on a large amount of labeled data for training, which is labor-intensive and requires extensive domain knowledge. In this paper, we first analyze the restrictions of GNNs generalization from the perspective of supervision signals in the context of few-shot semi-supervised node classification. To address these challenges, we propose a novel algorithm named NormProp, which utilizes the homophily assumption of unlabeled nodes to generate additional supervision signals, thereby enhancing the generalization against label scarcity. The key idea is to efficiently capture both the class information and the consistency of aggregation during message passing, via decoupling the direction and Euclidean norm of node representations. Moreover, we conduct a theoretical analysis to determine the upper bound of Euclidean norm, and then propose homophilous regularization to constraint the consistency of unlabeled nodes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that NormProp achieve state-of-the-art performance under low-label rate scenarios with low computational complexity.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2025</p></details> |

Although GNNs have shown great promise in handling traffic datasets, their deployment in real-life applications has been hindered by scalability constraints arising from high-order message passing. Additionally, the over-smoothing problem of GNNs may lead to indistinguishable region representations as the number of layers increases, resulting in performance degradation. To address these challenges, we propose a new knowledge distillation paradigm termed LightST that transfers spatial and temporal knowledge from a high-capacity teacher to a lightweight student. Specifically, we introduce a spatio-temporal knowledge distillation framework that helps student MLPs capture graph-structured global spatio-temporal patterns while alleviating the over-smoothing effect with adaptive knowledge distillation. Extensive experiments verify that LightST significantly speeds up traffic flow predictions by 5X to 40X compared to state-of-the-art spatio-temporal GNNs, all while maintaining superior accuracy.</p></details> | 9 pages |

However, serving GNNs on large graphs is challenging due to the high communication, computation, and memory overheads of constructing and executing computation graphs, which represent information flow across large neighborhoods. Existing approximation techniques in training can mitigate the overheads but, in serving, still lead to high latency and/or accuracy loss. To this end, we propose OMEGA, a system that enables low-latency GNN serving for large graphs with minimal accuracy loss through two key ideas. First, OMEGA employs selective recomputation of precomputed embeddings, which allows for reusing precomputed computation subgraphs while selectively recomputing a small fraction to minimize accuracy loss. Second, we develop computation graph parallelism, which reduces communication overhead by parallelizing the creation and execution of computation graphs across machines. Our evaluation with large graph datasets and GNN models shows that OMEGA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art techniques.</p></details> |  |

That said, popular goal representations, e.g., target states or natural language, are either limited to Markovian tasks or rely on ambiguous task semantics. We propose representing temporal goals using compositions of deterministic finite automata (cDFAs) and use cDFAs to guide RL agents. cDFAs balance the need for formal temporal semantics with ease of interpretation: if one can understand a flow chart, one can understand a cDFA. On the other hand, cDFAs form a countably infinite concept class with Boolean semantics, and subtle changes to the automaton can result in very different tasks, making them difficult to condition agent behavior on. To address this, we observe that all paths through a DFA correspond to a series of reach-avoid tasks and propose pre-training graph neural network embeddings on "reach-avoid derived" DFAs. Through empirical evaluation, we demonstrate that the proposed pre-training method enables zero-shot generalization to various cDFA task classes and accelerated policy specialization without the myopic suboptimality of hierarchical methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Predict Confidently, Predict Right: Abstention in Dynamic Graph Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08397v1)** | 2025-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many real-world systems can be modeled as dynamic graphs, where nodes and edges evolve over time, requiring specialized models to capture their evolving dynamics in risk-sensitive applications effectively. Temporal graph neural networks (GNNs) are one such category of specialized models. For the first time, our approach integrates a reject option strategy within the framework of GNNs for continuous-time dynamic graphs. This allows the model to strategically abstain from making predictions when the uncertainty is high and confidence is low, thus minimizing the risk of critical misclassification and enhancing the results and reliability. We propose a coverage-based abstention prediction model to implement the reject option that maximizes prediction within a specified coverage. It improves the prediction score for link prediction and node classification tasks. Temporal GNNs deal with extremely skewed datasets for the next state prediction or node classification task. In the case of class imbalance, our method can be further tuned to provide a higher weightage to the minority class. Exhaustive experiments are presented on four datasets for dynamic link prediction and two datasets for dynamic node classification tasks. This demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach in improving the reliability and area under the curve (AUC)/ average precision (AP) scores for predictions in dynamic graph scenarios. The results highlight our model's ability to efficiently handle the trade-offs between prediction confidence and coverage, making it a dependable solution for applications requiring high precision in dynamic and uncertain environments.</p></details> |  |

| **[Double Equivariance for Inductive Link Prediction for Both New Nodes and New Relation Types](http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.01313v8)** | 2025-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The task of fully inductive link prediction in knowledge graphs has gained significant attention, with various graph neural networks being proposed to address it. This task presents greater challenges than traditional inductive link prediction tasks with only new nodes, as models must be capable of zero-shot generalization to both unseen nodes and unseen relation types in the inference graph. Despite the development of novel models, a unifying theoretical understanding of their success remains elusive, and the limitations of these methods are not well-studied. In this work, we introduce the concept of double permutation-equivariant representations and demonstrate its necessity for effective performance in this task. We show that many existing models, despite their diverse architectural designs, conform to this framework. However, we also identify inherent limitations in double permutation-equivariant representations, which restrict these models's ability to learn effectively on datasets with varying characteristics. Our findings suggest that while double equivariance is necessary for meta-learning across knowledge graphs from different domains, it is not sufficient. There remains a fundamental gap between double permutation-equivariant models and the concept of foundation models designed to learn patterns across all domains.</p></details> |  |

Traditional approaches to VAD often rely on finetuning large pre-trained models, which can be computationally expensive and impractical for real-time or resource-constrained environments. To address this, MissionGNN introduced a more efficient method by training a graph neural network (GNN) using a fixed knowledge graph (KG) derived from large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4. While this approach demonstrated significant efficiency in computational power and memory, it faces limitations in dynamic environments where frequent updates to the KG are necessary due to evolving behavior trends and shifting data patterns. These updates typically require cloud-based computation, posing challenges for edge computing applications. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that facilitates continuous KG adaptation directly on edge devices, overcoming the limitations of cloud dependency. Our method dynamically modifies the KG through a three-phase process: pruning, alternating, and creating nodes, enabling real-time adaptation to changing data trends. This continuous learning approach enhances the robustness of anomaly detection models, making them more suitable for deployment in dynamic and resource-constrained environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to DATE 2025</p></details> |

Comprehending user emotions can provide valuable insights for improving communication and understanding of human behaviors. Despite significant advancements in Affective Computing, the diverse factors influencing user emotions in social networks remain relatively understudied. Moreover, there is a notable lack of deep learning-based methods for predicting user emotions in social networks, which could be addressed by leveraging the extensive multimodal data available. This work presents a novel formulation of personalized emotion prediction in social networks based on heterogeneous graph learning. Building upon this formulation, we design HMG-Emo, a Heterogeneous Multimodal Graph Learning Framework that utilizes deep learning-based features for user emotion recognition. Additionally, we include a dynamic context fusion module in HMG-Emo that is capable of adaptively integrating the different modalities in social media data. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of HMG-Emo and verify the superiority of adopting a graph neural network-based approach, which outperforms existing baselines that use rich hand-crafted features. To the best of our knowledge, HMG-Emo is the first multimodal and deep-learning-based approach to predict personalized emotions within online social networks. Our work highlights the significance of exploiting advanced deep learning techniques for less-explored problems in Affective Computing.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we propose Dynami-CAL GraphNet, a Physics-Informed Graph Neural Network that integrates the learning capabilities of GNNs with physics-based inductive biases to address these limitations. Dynami-CAL GraphNet enforces pairwise conservation of linear and angular momentum for interacting nodes using edge-local reference frames that are equivariant to rotational symmetries, invariant to translations, and equivariant to node permutations. This design ensures physically consistent predictions of node dynamics while offering interpretable, edge-wise linear and angular impulses resulting from pairwise interactions. Evaluated on a 3D granular system with inelastic collisions, Dynami-CAL GraphNet demonstrates stable error accumulation over extended rollouts, effective extrapolations to unseen configurations, and robust handling of heterogeneous interactions and external forces. Dynami-CAL GraphNet offers significant advantages in fields requiring accurate, interpretable, and real-time modeling of complex multi-body dynamical systems, such as robotics, aerospace engineering, and materials science. By providing physically consistent and scalable predictions that adhere to fundamental conservation laws, it enables the inference of forces and moments while efficiently handling heterogeneous interactions and external forces.</p></details> |  |
| **[Eradicating Social Biases in Sentiment Analysis using Semantic Blinding and Semantic Propagation Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12493v3)** | 2025-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces the Semantic Propagation Graph Neural Network (SProp GNN), a machine learning sentiment analysis (SA) architecture that relies exclusively on syntactic structures and word-level emotional cues to predict emotions in text. By semantically blinding the model to information about specific words, it is robust to social biases such as political or gender bias that have been plaguing previous machine learning-based SA systems. The SProp GNN shows performance superior to lexicon-based alternatives such as VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and Sentiment Reasoner) and EmoAtlas on two different prediction tasks, and across two languages. Additionally, it approaches the accuracy of transformer-based models while significantly reducing bias in emotion prediction tasks. By offering improved explainability and reducing bias, the SProp GNN bridges the methodological gap between interpretable lexicon approaches and powerful, yet often opaque, deep learning models, offering a robust tool for fair and effective emotion analysis in understanding human behavior through text.</p></details> |  |
| **[GFairHint: Improving Individual Fairness for Graph Neural Networks via Fairness Hint](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.15622v2)** | 2025-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Given the growing concerns about fairness in machine learning and the impressive performance of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) on graph data learning, algorithmic fairness in GNNs has attracted significant attention. While many existing studies improve fairness at the group level, only a few works promote individual fairness, which renders similar outcomes for similar individuals. A desirable framework that promotes individual fairness should (1) balance between fairness and performance, (2) accommodate two commonly-used individual similarity measures (externally annotated and computed from input features), (3) generalize across various GNN models, and (4) be computationally efficient. Unfortunately, none of the prior work achieves all the desirables. In this work, we propose a novel method, GFairHint, which promotes individual fairness in GNNs and achieves all aforementioned desirables. GFairHint learns fairness representations through an auxiliary link prediction task, and then concatenates the representations with the learned node embeddings in original GNNs as a "fairness hint". Through extensive experimental investigations on five real-world graph datasets under three prevalent GNN models covering both individual similarity measures above, GFairHint achieves the best fairness results in almost all combinations of datasets with various backbone models, while generating comparable utility results, with much less computational cost compared to the previous state-of-the-art (SoTA) method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the ACM Transactions on Knowledge Discovery from Data (TKDD 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Generalizable Graph Neural Networks for Robust Power Grid Topology Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07186v1)** | 2025-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The energy transition necessitates new congestion management methods. One such method is controlling the grid topology with machine learning (ML). This approach has gained popularity following the Learning to Run a Power Network (L2RPN) competitions. Graph neural networks (GNNs) are a class of ML models that reflect graph structure in their computation, which makes them suitable for power grid modeling. Various GNN approaches for topology control have thus been proposed. We propose the first GNN model for grid topology control that uses only GNN layers. Additionally, we identify the busbar information asymmetry problem that the popular homogeneous graph representation suffers from, and propose a heterogeneous graph representation to resolve it. We train both homogeneous and heterogeneous GNNs and fully connected neural networks (FCNN) baselines on an imitation learning task. We evaluate the models according to their classification accuracy and grid operation ability. We find that the heterogeneous GNNs perform best on in-distribution networks, followed by the FCNNs, and lastly, the homogeneous GNNs. We also find that both GNN types generalize better to out-of-distribution networks than FCNNs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Duplex: Dual Prototype Learning for Compositional Zero-Shot Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07114v1)** | 2025-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Compositional Zero-Shot Learning (CZSL) aims to enable models to recognize novel compositions of visual states and objects that were absent during training. Existing methods predominantly focus on learning semantic representations of seen compositions but often fail to disentangle the independent features of states and objects in images, thereby limiting their ability to generalize to unseen compositions. To address this challenge, we propose Duplex, a novel dual-prototype learning method that integrates semantic and visual prototypes through a carefully designed dual-branch architecture, enabling effective representation learning for compositional tasks. Duplex utilizes a Graph Neural Network (GNN) to adaptively update visual prototypes, capturing complex interactions between states and objects. Additionally, it leverages the strong visual-semantic alignment of pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and employs a multi-path architecture combined with prompt engineering to align image and text representations, ensuring robust generalization. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that Duplex outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both closed-world and open-world settings.</p></details> |  |

The utilization of graph-based structures, such as bipartite graphs, has gained popularity for their ability to analyze complex data relationships. Link prediction is crucial for recommending specific items to users. Traditional methods in this area often involve identifying patterns in the graph structure or using representational techniques like graph neural networks (GNNs). However, these approaches encounter difficulties as the volume of data increases. To address these challenges, we propose a model called Graph Contrastive Learning for Multi-label Classification (MCGCL). MCGCL leverages contrastive learning to enhance recommendation effectiveness. The model incorporates two training stages: a main task and a subtask. The main task is holistic user-item graph learning to capture user-item relationships. The homogeneous user-user (item-item) subgraph is constructed to capture user-user and item-item relationships in the subtask. We assessed the performance using real-world datasets from Amazon Reviews in multi-label classification tasks. Comparative experiments with state-of-the-art methods confirm the effectiveness of MCGCL, highlighting its potential for improving recommendation systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint. 10 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |
| **[A Property Encoder for Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11554v2)** | 2025-01-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph machine learning, particularly using graph neural networks, fundamentally relies on node features. Nevertheless, numerous real-world systems, such as social and biological networks, often lack node features due to various reasons, including privacy concerns, incomplete or missing data, and limitations in data collection. In such scenarios, researchers typically resort to methods like structural and positional encoding to construct node features. However, the length of such features is contingent on the maximum value within the property being encoded, for example, the highest node degree, which can be exceedingly large in applications like scale-free networks. Furthermore, these encoding schemes are limited to categorical data and might not be able to encode metrics returning other type of values. In this paper, we introduce a novel, universally applicable encoder, termed \emph{PropEnc}, which constructs expressive node embedding from any given graph metric. \emph{PropEnc} leverages histogram construction combined with reversed index encoding, offering a flexible method for node features initialization. It supports flexible encoding in terms of both dimensionality and type of input, demonstrating its effectiveness across diverse applications. \emph{PropEnc} allows encoding metrics in low-dimensional space which effectively address the sparsity challenge and enhances the efficiency of the models. We show that \emph{PropEnc} can construct node features that either exactly replicate one-hot encoding or closely approximate indices under various settings. Our extensive evaluations in graph classification setting across multiple social networks that lack node features support our hypothesis. The empirical results conclusively demonstrate that \emph{PropEnc} is both an efficient and effective mechanism for constructing node features from diverse set of graph metrics.</p></details> | conference paper |
