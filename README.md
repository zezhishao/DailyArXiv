| **[Detecting Parameter Instabilities in Functional Concurrent Linear Regression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13152v1)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We develop methodology to detect structural breaks in the slope function of a concurrent functional linear regression model for functional time series in $C[0,1]$. Our test is based on a CUSUM process of regressor-weighted OLS residual functions. To accommodate both global and local changes, we propose $L^2$- and sup-norm versions, with the sup-norm particularly sensitive to spike-like changes. Under Hölder regularity and weak dependence conditions, we establish a functional strong invariance principle, derive the asymptotic null distribution, and show that the resulting tests are consistent against a broad class of alternatives with breaks in the slope function. Simulation studies illustrate finite-sample size and power. We apply the method to sports data obtained via body-worn sensors from running athletes, focusing on hip and knee joint-angle trajectories recorded during a fatiguing run. As fatigue accumulates, runners adapt their movement patterns, and sufficiently pronounced adjustments are expected to appear as a change point in the regression relationship. In this manner, we illustrate how the proposed tests support interpretable inference for biomechanical functional time series.</p></details> |  |
| **[Barron-Wiener-Laguerre models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13098v1)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a probabilistic extension of Wiener-Laguerre models for causal operator learning. Classical Wiener-Laguerre models parameterize stable linear dynamics using orthonormal Laguerre bases and apply a static nonlinear map to the resulting features. While structurally efficient and interpretable, they provide only deterministic point estimates. We reinterpret the nonlinear component through the lens of Barron function approximation, viewing two-layer networks, random Fourier features, and extreme learning machines as discretizations of integral representations over parameter measures. This perspective naturally admits Bayesian inference on the nonlinear map and yields posterior predictive uncertainty. By combining Laguerre-parameterized causal dynamics with probabilistic Barron-type nonlinear approximators, we obtain a structured yet expressive class of causal operators equipped with uncertainty quantification. The resulting framework bridges classical system identification and modern measure-based function approximation, providing a principled approach to time-series modeling and nonlinear systems identification.</p></details> |  |
| **[Kairos: Toward Adaptive and Parameter-Efficient Time Series Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25826v2)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inherent temporal heterogeneity, such as varying sampling densities and periodic structures, has posed substantial challenges in zero-shot generalization for Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs). Existing TSFMs predominantly rely on massive parameterization to absorb such heterogeneity, as their static tokenization and positional encoding schemes entangle diverse temporal patterns into a fixed representation space, encouraging memorization rather than adaptation. To address this limitation, we propose Kairos, a flexible and parameter-efficient TSFM that decouples temporal heterogeneity from model capacity through a novel tokenization perspective. Kairos introduces a dynamic patching tokenizer and a mixture-of-size encoding that adapt observational granularity to local information density, enabling fine-grained temporal abstraction without increasing model width or depth. In addition, we design a multi-granularity positional embedding based on dynamic rotary encodings, which conditions on instance-level spectral features and temporal structure induced by dynamic patching tokenization, allowing robust modeling of diverse temporal dependencies. Trained on a novel Predictability-Stratified Time-Series (PreSTS) corpus, Kairos achieves superior zero-shot performance with substantially fewer parameters on two mainstream benchmarks, GIFT-Eval and Time-Series-Library.

| **[EXCODER: EXplainable Classification Of DiscretE time series Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13087v1)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning has significantly improved time series classification, yet the lack of explainability in these models remains a major challenge. While Explainable AI (XAI) techniques aim to make model decisions more transparent, their effectiveness is often hindered by the high dimensionality and noise present in raw time series data. In this work, we investigate whether transforming time series into discrete latent representations-using methods such as Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoders (VQ-VAE) and Discrete Variational Autoencoders (DVAE)-not only preserves but enhances explainability by reducing redundancy and focusing on the most informative patterns. We show that applying XAI methods to these compressed representations leads to concise and structured explanations that maintain faithfulness without sacrificing classification performance. Additionally, we propose Similar Subsequence Accuracy (SSA), a novel metric that quantitatively assesses the alignment between XAI-identified salient subsequences and the label distribution in the training data. SSA provides a systematic way to validate whether the features highlighted by XAI methods are truly representative of the learned classification patterns. Our findings demonstrate that discrete latent representations not only retain the essential characteristics needed for classification but also offer a pathway to more compact, interpretable, and computationally efficient explanations in time series analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at PAKDD 2026</p></details> |
| **[LTSM-Bundle: A Toolbox and Benchmark on Large Language Models for Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14045v3)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time Series Forecasting (TSF) has long been a challenge in time series analysis. Inspired by the success of Large Language Models (LLMs), researchers are now developing Large Time Series Models (LTSMs)-universal transformer-based models that use autoregressive prediction-to improve TSF. However, training LTSMs on heterogeneous time series data poses unique challenges, including diverse frequencies, dimensions, and patterns across datasets. Recent endeavors have studied and evaluated various design choices aimed at enhancing LTSM training and generalization capabilities. However, these design choices are typically studied and evaluated in isolation and are not benchmarked collectively. In this work, we introduce LTSM-Bundle, a comprehensive toolbox, and benchmark for training LTSMs, spanning pre-processing techniques, model configurations, and dataset configuration. It modularized and benchmarked LTSMs from multiple dimensions, encompassing prompting strategies, tokenization approaches, training paradigms, base model selection, data quantity, and dataset diversity. Furthermore, we combine the most effective design choices identified in our study. Empirical results demonstrate that this combination achieves superior zero-shot and few-shot performances compared to state-of-the-art LTSMs and traditional TSF methods on benchmark datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Uncertainty in Federated Granger Causality: From Origins to Systemic Consequences](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13004v1)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Granger Causality (GC) provides a rigorous framework for learning causal structures from time-series data. Recent federated variants of GC have targeted distributed infrastructure applications (e.g., smart grids) with distributed clients that generate high-dimensional data bound by data-sovereignty constraints. However, Federated GC algorithms only yield deterministic point estimates of causality and neglect uncertainty. This paper establishes the first methodology for rigorously quantifying uncertainty and its propagation within federated GC frameworks. We systematically classify sources of uncertainty, explicitly differentiating aleatoric (data noise) from epistemic (model variability) effects. We derive closed-form recursions that model the evolution of uncertainty through client-server interactions and identify four novel cross-covariance components that couple data uncertainties with model parameter uncertainties across the federated architecture. We also define rigorous convergence conditions for these uncertainty recursions and obtain explicit steady-state variances for both server and client model parameters. Our convergence analysis demonstrates that steady-state variances depend exclusively on client data statistics, thus eliminating dependence on initial epistemic priors and enhancing robustness. Empirical evaluations on synthetic benchmarks and real-world industrial datasets demonstrate that explicitly characterizing uncertainty significantly improves the reliability and interpretability of federated causal inference.</p></details> | <details><summary>Manus...</summary><p>Manuscript under review</p></details> |
| **[Instruction-based Time Series Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01504v4)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In time series editing, we aim to modify some properties of a given time series without altering others. For example, when analyzing a hospital patient's blood pressure, we may add a sudden early drop and observe how it impacts their future while preserving other conditions. Existing diffusion-based editors rely on rigid, predefined attribute vectors as conditions and produce all-or-nothing edits through sampling. This attribute- and sampling-based approach limits flexibility in condition format and lacks customizable control over editing strength. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Instruction-based Time Series Editing, where users specify intended edits using natural language. This allows users to express a wider range of edits in a more accessible format. We then introduce InstructTime, the first instruction-based time series editor. InstructTime takes in time series and instructions, embeds them into a shared multi-modal representation space, then decodes their embeddings to generate edited time series. By learning a structured multi-modal representation space, we can easily interpolate between embeddings to achieve varying degrees of edit. To handle local and global edits together, we propose multi-resolution encoders. In our experiments, we use synthetic and real datasets and find that InstructTime is a state-of-the-art time series editor: InstructTime achieves high-quality edits with controllable strength, can generalize to unseen instructions, and can be easily adapted to unseen conditions through few-shot learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>(KDD ...</summary><p>(KDD 26) Proceedings of the 32nd ACM SIGKDD Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining V.1</p></details> |
| **[Context-Specific Causal Graph Discovery with Unobserved Contexts: Non-Stationarity, Regimes and Spatio-Temporal Patterns](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21537v2)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-world problems, for example in climate applications, often require causal reasoning on spatially gridded time series data or data with comparable structure. While the underlying system is often believed to behave similarly at different Points in space and time, those variations that do exist are relevant twofold: They often encode important information in and of themselves. And they may negatively affect the stability and validity of results if not accounted for. We study the information encoded in changes of the causal graph, with stability in mind. Two core challenges arise, related to the complexity of encoding system-states and to statistical convergence properties in the presence of imperfectly recoverable non-stationary structure. We provide a framework realizing principles conceptually suitable to overcome these challenges - an interpretation supported by numerical experiments. Primarily, we modify constraint-based causal discovery approaches on the level of independence testing. This leads to a framework which is additionally highly modular, easily extensible and widely applicable. For example, it allows to leverage existing constraint-based causal discovery methods (demonstrated on PC, PC-stable, FCI, PCMCI, PCMCI+ and LPCMCI), and to systematically divide the problem into simpler subproblems that are easier to analyze and understand and relate more clearly to well-studied problems like change-point-detection, clustering, independence-testing and more.

| **[PriceFM: Foundation Model for Probabilistic Electricity Price Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04875v3)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Electricity price forecasting in Europe presents unique challenges due to the continent's increasingly integrated and physically interconnected power market. While recent advances in foundation models have led to substantial improvements in general time series forecasting, most existing approaches do not incorporate prior graph knowledge from the transmission topology, which can limit their ability to exploit meaningful cross-region dependencies in interconnected power systems, motivating a domain-specific foundation model. In this paper, we address this gap by first introducing a comprehensive and up-to-date dataset across 24 European countries (38 regions), spanning from 2022-01-01 to 2026-01-01. Building on this groundwork, we propose PriceFM, a probabilistic foundation model pretrained on this large dataset. Specifically, PriceFM maps each region's price and exogenous features into a comparable latent embedding via a shared Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) projection layer, then injects prior graph knowledge by constructing a sparse graph mask derived from transmission topology. Across a large-scale European benchmark, PriceFM achieves strong performance and demonstrates superior generalization under both zero-shot and full-shot evaluation compared with multiple competitive baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 5 figures, 9 tables</p></details> |
| **[Closing the Loop: A Control-Theoretic Framework for Provably Stable Time Series Forecasting with LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12756v1)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently shown exceptional potential in time series forecasting, leveraging their inherent sequential reasoning capabilities to model complex temporal dynamics. However, existing approaches typically employ a naive autoregressive generation strategy. We identify a critical theoretical flaw in this paradigm: during inference, the model operates in an open-loop manner, consuming its own generated outputs recursively. This leads to inevitable error accumulation (exposure bias), where minor early deviations cascade into significant trajectory drift over long horizons. In this paper, we reformulate autoregressive forecasting through the lens of control theory, proposing \textbf{F-LLM} (Feedback-driven LLM), a novel closed-loop framework. Unlike standard methods that passively propagate errors, F-LLM actively stabilizes the trajectory via a learnable residual estimator (Observer) and a feedback controller. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical guarantee that our closed-loop mechanism ensures uniformly bounded error, provided the base model satisfies a local Lipschitz constraint. Extensive experiments demonstrate that F-LLM significantly mitigates error propagation, achieving good performance on time series benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond All-to-All: Causal-Aligned Transformer with Dynamic Structure Learning for Multivariate Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16308v2)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most existing multivariate time series forecasting methods adopt an all-to-all paradigm that feeds all variable histories into a unified model to predict their future values without distinguishing their individual roles. However, this undifferentiated paradigm makes it difficult to identify variable-specific causal influences and often entangles causally relevant information with spurious correlations. To address this limitation, we propose an all-to-one forecasting paradigm that predicts each target variable separately. Specifically, we first construct a Structural Causal Model from observational data and then, for each target variable, we partition the historical sequence into four subsegments according to the inferred causal structure: endogenous, direct causal, collider causal, and spurious correlation. Furthermore, we propose the Causal Decomposition Transformer (CDT), which integrates a dynamic causal adapter to learn causal structures initialized by the inferred graph, enabling correction of imperfect causal discovery during training. Furthermore, motivated by causal theory, we apply a projection-based output constraint to mitigate collider induced bias and improve robustness. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the CDT.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adaptive Structured Pruning of Convolutional Neural Networks for Time Series Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12744v1)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning models for Time Series Classification (TSC) have achieved strong predictive performance but their high computational and memory requirements often limit deployment on resource-constrained devices. While structured pruning can address these issues by removing redundant filters, existing methods typically rely on manually tuned hyperparameters such as pruning ratios which limit scalability and generalization across datasets. In this work, we propose Dynamic Structured Pruning (DSP), a fully automatic, structured pruning framework for convolution-based TSC models. DSP introduces an instance-wise sparsity loss during training to induce channel-level sparsity, followed by a global activation analysis to identify and prune redundant filters without needing any predefined pruning ratio. This work tackles computational bottlenecks of deep TSC models for deployment on resource-constrained devices. We validate DSP on 128 UCR datasets using two different deep state-of-the-art architectures: LITETime and InceptionTime. Our approach achieves an average compression of 58% for LITETime and 75% for InceptionTime architectures while maintaining classification accuracy. Redundancy analyses confirm that DSP produces compact and informative representations, offering a practical path for scalable and efficient deep TSC deployment.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 16 figures.

| **[On the relation between Global VAR Models and Matrix Time Series Models with Multiple Terms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12710v1)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Matrix valued time series (MaTS) and global vector autoregressive (GVAR) models both impose restrictions on the general VAR for multidimensional data sets, in order to bring down the number of parameters. Both models are motivated from a different viewpoint such that on first sight they do not have much in common. When investigating the models more closely, however, one notices many connections between the two model sets. This paper investigates the relations between the restrictions imposed by the two models. We show that under appropriate restrictions in both models we obtain a joint framework allowing to gain insight into the nature of GVARs from the viewpoint of MaTS.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diffusion-Based Scenario Tree Generation for Multivariate Time Series Prediction and Multistage Stochastic Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14832v2)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Stochastic forecasting is critical for efficient decision-making in uncertain systems, such as energy markets and finance, where estimating the full distribution of future scenarios is essential. We propose Diffusion Scenario Tree (DST), a general framework for constructing scenario trees using diffusion-based probabilistic forecasting models to provide a structured model of system evolution for control tasks. DST recursively samples future trajectories and organizes them into a tree via clustering, ensuring non-anticipativity (decisions depending only on observed history) at each stage, offering a superior representation of uncertainty compared to using predictive models solely for forecasting system evolution. We integrate DST into Model Predictive Control (MPC) and evaluate it on energy arbitrage in New York State's day-ahead electricity market. Experimental results show that our approach significantly outperforms the same optimization algorithms that use scenario trees generated by more conventional models. Furthermore, using DST for stochastic optimization yields more efficient decision policies by better handling uncertainty than deterministic and stochastic MPC variants using the same diffusion-based forecaster, and simple Model-Free Reinforcement Learning (RL) baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 2 figures, 1 table, and 1 algorithm.

| **[Modelling multivariate ordinal time series using pairwise likelihood](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12702v1)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We assume that we have multiple ordinal time series and we would like to specify their joint distribution. In general it is difficult to create multivariate distribution that can be easily used to jointly model ordinal variables and the problem becomes even more complex in the case of time series, since we have to take into consideration not only the autocorrelation of each time series and the dependence between time series, but also cross-correlation. Starting from the simplest case of two ordinal time series, we propose using copulas to specify their joint distribution. We extend our approach in higher dimensions, by approximating full likelihood with composite likelihood and especially conditional pairwise likelihood, where each bivariate model is specified by copulas. We suggest maximizing each bivariate model independently to avoid computational issues and synthesize individual estimates using weighted mean. Weights are related to the Hessian matrix of each bivariate model. Simulation studies showed that model fits well under different sample sizes. Forecasting approach is also discussed. A small real data application about unemployment state of different countries of European Union is presented to illustrate our approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deep Time-Series Models Meet Volatility: Multi-Horizon Electricity Price Forecasting in the Australian National Electricity Market](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01157v2)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate electricity price forecasting (EPF) is increasingly difficult in markets characterised by extreme volatility, frequent price spikes, and rapid structural shifts. Deep learning (DL) has been increasingly adopted in EPF due to its ability to achieve high forecasting accuracy. Recently, state-of-the-art (SOTA) deep time-series models have demonstrated promising performance across general forecasting tasks. Yet, their effectiveness in highly volatile electricity markets remains underexplored. Moreover, existing EPF studies rarely assess how model accuracy varies across intraday periods, leaving model sensitivity to market conditions unexplored. To address these gaps, this paper proposes an EPF framework that systematically evaluates SOTA deep time-series models using a direct multi-horizon forecasting approach across day-ahead and two-day-ahead settings. We conduct a comprehensive empirical study across all five regions of the Australian National Electricity Market using contemporary, high-volatility data. The results reveal a clear gap between time-series benchmark expectations and observed performance under real-world price volatility: recent deep time-series models often fail to surpass standard DL baselines. All models experience substantial degradation under extreme and negative prices, yet DL baselines often remain competitive. Intraday performance analysis further reveals that all evaluated models are consistently vulnerable to prevailing market conditions, where absolute errors peak during evening ramps, relative errors escalate during midday negative-price periods, and directional accuracy deteriorates sharply during abrupt shifts in price direction. These findings emphasise the need for volatility-aware modelling strategies and richer feature representations to advance EPF.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 4 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |
| **[Power Interpretable Causal ODE Networks: A Unified Model for Explainable Anomaly Detection and Root Cause Analysis in Power Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12592v1)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Anomaly detection and root cause analysis (RCA) are critical for ensuring the safety and resilience of cyber-physical systems such as power grids. However, existing machine learning models for time series anomaly detection often operate as black boxes, offering only binary outputs without any explanation, such as identifying anomaly type and origin. To address this challenge, we propose Power Interpretable Causality Ordinary Differential Equation (PICODE) Networks, a unified, causality-informed architecture that jointly performs anomaly detection along with the explanation why it is detected as an anomaly, including root cause localization, anomaly type classification, and anomaly shape characterization. Experimental results in power systems demonstrate that PICODE achieves competitive detection performance while offering improved interpretability and reduced reliance on labeled data or external causal graphs. We provide theoretical results demonstrating the alignment between the shape of anomaly functions and the changes in the weights of the extracted causal graphs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Task- and Metric-Specific Signal Quality Indices for Medical Time Series](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12478v1)** | 2026-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical time series such as electrocardiograms (ECGs) and photoplethysmograms (PPGs) are frequently affected by measurement artifacts due to challenging acquisition environments, such as in ambulances and during routine daily activities. Since automated algorithms for analyzing such signals increasingly inform clinically relevant decisions, identifying signal segments on which these algorithms may produce unreliable outputs is of critical importance. Signal quality indices (SQIs) are commonly used for this purpose. However, most existing SQIs are task agnostic and do not account for the specific algorithm and performance metric used downstream. In this work, we formalize signal quality as a task- and metric-dependent concept and propose a perturbation-based SQI (pSQI) that aims to detect an algorithm's performance degradation on an input signal with respect to a metric. The pSQI is defined as the worst-case value of the performance metric under an additive, colored Gaussian noise perturbation with a lower-bounded signal-to-noise ratio. We introduce formal requirements for task- and metric-specific SQIs, including monotonicity of the metric in expectation and maximal separation under thresholding. Experiments on R-peak detection and atrial fibrillation classification benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed pSQI consistently outperforms existing feature- and deep learning-based SQIs in identifying unreliable inputs without requiring training.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 3 figures, submitted to EUSIPCO 2026</p></details> |
| **[Discrete Chi-Square Method can model and forecast complex time series](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01540v5)** | 2026-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We show how intensive, large and accurate time series can allow us to see through time. Many phenomena have aperiodic and periodic components. An ideal time series analysis method would detect such trend and signal(-s) combinations. The widely-used Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) and other frequency-domain parametric time series analysis methods have many application limitations constraining the trend and signal(-s) detection. We show that none of those limitations constrains our Discrete Chi-square Method (DCM) which can detect signal(-s) superimposed on an unknown trend. Our simulated time series analyses ascertain the revolutionary Window Dimension Effect (WDE): ``For any sample window $ΔT$, DCM inevitably detects the correct $p(t)$ trend and $h(t)$ signal(-s) when the sample size $n$ and/or data accuracy $σ$ increase.'' The simulations also expose the DFT's weaknesses and the DCM's efficiency. The DCM's backbone is the Gauss-Markov theorem that the Least Squares (LS) is the best unbiased estimator for linear regression models. DCM can not fail because this simple method is based on the computation of a massive number of linear model LS fits. The Fisher-test gives the signal significance estimates and identifies the best DCM model from all alternative tested DCM models. The analytical solution for the non-linear DCM model is an ill-posed problem. We present a computational well-posed solution. The DCM can forecast complex time series. The best DCM model must be correct if it passes our Forecast-test. Our DCM is ideal for forecasting because its WDE spearhead is robust against short sample windows and complex time series. In our appendix, we show that DCM can model and forecast El Niño.</p></details> |  |
| **[Model checking with temporal graphs and their derivative](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12446v1)** | 2026-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal graphs are graphs where the presence or properties of their vertices and edges change over time. When time is discrete, a temporal graph can be defined as a sequence of static graphs over a discrete time span, called lifetime, or as a single graph where each edge is associated with a specific set of time instants where the edge is alive. For static graphs, Courcelle's Theorem asserts that any graph problem expressible in monadic second-order logic can be solved in linear time on graphs of bounded tree-width. We propose the first adaptation of Courcelle's Theorem for monadic second-order logic on temporal graphs that does not explicitly rely on the lifetime as a parameter. We then introduce the notion of derivative over a sliding time window of a chosen size, and define the tree-width and twin-width of the temporal graph's derivative. We exemplify its usefulness with meta theorems with respect to a temporal variant of first-order logic. The resulting logic expresses a wide range of temporal graph problems including a version of temporal cliques, an important notion when querying time series databases for community structures.</p></details> |  |
| **[Policy4OOD: A Knowledge-Guided World Model for Policy Intervention Simulation against the Opioid Overdose Crisis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12373v1)** | 2026-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The opioid epidemic remains one of the most severe public health crises in the United States, yet evaluating policy interventions before implementation is difficult: multiple policies interact within a dynamic system where targeting one risk pathway may inadvertently amplify another. We argue that effective opioid policy evaluation requires three capabilities -- forecasting future outcomes under current policies, counterfactual reasoning about alternative past decisions, and optimization over candidate interventions -- and propose to unify them through world modeling. We introduce Policy4OOD, a knowledge-guided spatio-temporal world model that addresses three core challenges: what policies prescribe, where effects manifest, and when effects unfold.Policy4OOD jointly encodes policy knowledge graphs, state-level spatial dependencies, and socioeconomic time series into a policy-conditioned Transformer that forecasts future opioid outcomes.Once trained, the world model serves as a simulator: forecasting requires only a forward pass, counterfactual analysis substitutes alternative policy encodings in the historical sequence, and policy optimization employs Monte Carlo Tree Search over the learned simulator. To support this framework, we construct a state-level monthly dataset (2019--2024) integrating opioid mortality, socioeconomic indicators, and structured policy encodings. Experiments demonstrate that spatial dependencies and structured policy knowledge significantly improve forecasting accuracy, validating each architectural component and the potential of world modeling for data-driven public health decision support.</p></details> |  |
| **[Self-Supervised Temporal Super-Resolution of Energy Data using Generative Adversarial Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10587v4)** | 2026-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To bridge the temporal granularity gap in energy network design and operation based on Energy System Models, resampling of time series is required. While conventional upsampling methods are computationally efficient, they often result in significant information loss or increased noise. Advanced models such as time series generation models, Super-Resolution models and imputation models show potential, but also face fundamental challenges. The goal of time series generative models is to learn the distribution of the original data to generate high-resolution series with similar statistical characteristics. This is not entirely consistent with the definition of upsampling. Time series Super-Resolution models or imputation models can degrade the accuracy of upsampling because the input low-resolution time series are sparse and may have insufficient context. Moreover, such models usually rely on supervised learning paradigms. This presents a fundamental application paradox: their training requires the high-resolution time series that is intrinsically absent in upsampling application scenarios. To address the mentioned upsampling issue, this paper introduces a new method utilizing Generative Adversarial Transformers (GATs), which can be trained without access to any ground-truth high-resolution data. Compared with conventional interpolation methods, the introduced method can reduce the root mean square error (RMSE) of upsampling tasks by 10%, and the accuracy of a model predictive control (MPC) application scenario is improved by 13%.</p></details> | <details><summary>The a...</summary><p>The authors have identified a critical error in the experimental setup (data leakage in the training/validation split) that invalidates the self-supervised learning claims presented in this version.

| **[Predicting Dynamic Map States from Limited Field-of-View Sensor Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12360v1)** | 2026-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>When autonomous systems are deployed in real-world scenarios, sensors are often subject to limited field-of-view (FOV) constraints, either naturally through system design, or through unexpected occlusions or sensor failures. In conditions where a large FOV is unavailable, it is important to be able to infer information about the environment and predict the state of nearby surroundings based on available data to maintain safe and accurate operation. In this work, we explore the effectiveness of deep learning for dynamic map state prediction based on limited FOV time series data. We show that by representing dynamic sensor data in a simple single-image format that captures both spatial and temporal information, we can effectively use a wide variety of existing image-to-image learning models to predict map states with high accuracy in a diverse set of sensing scenarios.</p></details> | 7 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Self-Supervised Learning via Flow-Guided Neural Operator on Time-Series Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12267v1)** | 2026-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Self-supervised learning (SSL) is a powerful paradigm for learning from unlabeled time-series data. However, popular methods such as masked autoencoders (MAEs) rely on reconstructing inputs from a fixed, predetermined masking ratio. Instead of this static design, we propose treating the corruption level as a new degree of freedom for representation learning, enhancing flexibility and performance. To achieve this, we introduce the Flow-Guided Neural Operator (FGNO), a novel framework combining operator learning with flow matching for SSL training. FGNO learns mappings in functional spaces by using Short-Time Fourier Transform to unify different time resolutions. We extract a rich hierarchy of features by tapping into different network layers and flow times that apply varying strengths of noise to the input data. This enables the extraction of versatile representations, from low-level patterns to high-level global features, using a single model adaptable to specific tasks. Unlike prior generative SSL methods that use noisy inputs during inference, we propose using clean inputs for representation extraction while learning representations with noise; this eliminates randomness and boosts accuracy. We evaluate FGNO across three biomedical domains, where it consistently outperforms established baselines. Our method yields up to 35% AUROC gains in neural signal decoding (BrainTreeBank), 16% RMSE reductions in skin temperature prediction (DREAMT), and over 20% improvement in accuracy and macro-F1 on SleepEDF under low-data regimes. These results highlight FGNO's robustness to data scarcity and its superior capacity to learn expressive representations for diverse time series.</p></details> |  |

While extensively studied on classification models, their impact on time series forecasting remains largely unexplored. We address this gap by introducing two new attacks: (i) an adaptation of multivariate LiRA, a state-of-the-art MIA originally developed for classification models, to the time-series forecasting setting, and (ii) a novel end-to-end learning approach called Deep Time Series (DTS) attack. We benchmark these methods against adapted versions of other leading attacks from the classification setting. We evaluate all attacks in realistic settings on the TUH-EEG and ELD datasets, targeting two strong forecasting architectures, LSTM and the state-of-the-art N-HiTS, under both record- and user-level threat models. Our results show that forecasting models are vulnerable, with user-level attacks often achieving perfect detection. The proposed methods achieve the strongest performance in several settings, establishing new baselines for privacy risk assessment in time series forecasting. Furthermore, vulnerability increases with longer prediction horizons and smaller training populations, echoing trends observed in large language models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond Accuracy: A Stability-Aware Metric for Multi-Horizon Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10863v2)** | 2026-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional time series forecasting methods optimize for accuracy alone. This objective neglects temporal consistency, in other words, how consistently a model predicts the same future event as the forecast origin changes. We introduce the forecast accuracy and coherence score (forecast AC score for short) for measuring the quality of probabilistic multi-horizon forecasts in a way that accounts for both multi-horizon accuracy and stability. Our score additionally allows user-specified weights to balance accuracy and consistency requirements. As an example application, we implement the score as a differentiable objective function for training seasonal auto-regressive integrated models and evaluate it on the M4 Hourly benchmark dataset. Results demonstrate substantial improvements over traditional maximum likelihood estimation. Regarding stability, the AC-optimized model generated out-of-sample forecasts with 91.1\% reduced vertical variance relative to the MLE-fitted model. In terms of accuracy, the AC-optimized model achieved considerable improvements for medium-to-long-horizon forecasts. While one-step-ahead forecasts exhibited a 7.5\% increase in MAPE, all subsequent horizons experienced an improved accuracy as measured by MAPE of up to 26\%. These results indicate that our metric successfully trains models to produce more stable and accurate multi-step forecasts in exchange for some degradation in one-step-ahead performance.</p></details> |  |

We propose WaveFormer, a transformer architecture that integrates wavelet decomposition at two critical stages: embedding construction, where multi-channel Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) extracts frequency features to create tokens containing both time-domain and frequency-domain information, and positional encoding, where Dynamic Wavelet Positional Encoding (DyWPE) adapts position embeddings to signal-specific temporal structure through mono-channel DWT analysis. We evaluate WaveFormer on eight diverse datasets spanning human activity recognition and brain signal analysis, with sequence lengths ranging from 50 to 3000 timesteps and channel counts from 1 to 144. Experimental results demonstrate that WaveFormer achieves competitive performance through comprehensive frequency-aware processing. Our approach provides a principled framework for incorporating frequency-domain knowledge into transformer-based time series classification.</p></details> |  |

In medicine, they hold particular promise for synthesizing large volumes of clinical information into actionable insights and digital health applications. Yet, a major limitation remains their inability to handle time series. To overcome this gap, we present OpenTSLM, a family of Time Series Language Models (TSLMs) created by integrating time series as a native modality to pretrained LLMs, enabling reasoning over multiple time series of any length. We investigate two architectures for OpenTSLM. The first, OpenTSLM-SoftPrompt, models time series implicitly by concatenating learnable time series tokens with text tokens via soft prompting. Although parameter-efficient, we hypothesize that explicit time series modeling scales better and outperforms implicit approaches. We thus introduce OpenTSLM-Flamingo, which integrates time series with text via cross-attention. We benchmark both variants against baselines that treat time series as text tokens or plots, across a suite of text-time-series Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning tasks. We introduce three datasets: HAR-CoT, Sleep-CoT, and ECG-QA-CoT. Across all, OpenTSLM models outperform baselines, reaching 69.9 F1 in sleep staging and 65.4 in HAR, compared to 9.05 and 52.2 for finetuned text-only models. Notably, even 1B-parameter OpenTSLM models surpass GPT-4o (15.47 and 2.95). OpenTSLM-Flamingo matches OpenTSLM-SoftPrompt in performance and outperforms on longer sequences, while maintaining stable memory requirements. By contrast, SoftPrompt grows exponentially in memory with sequence length, requiring around 110 GB compared to 40 GB VRAM when training on ECG-QA with LLaMA-3B. Expert reviews by clinicians find strong reasoning capabilities exhibited by OpenTSLMs on ECG-QA. To facilitate further research, we provide all code, datasets, and models open-source.</p></details> |  |

While traditional numerical weather prediction (NWP) remains the cornerstone of operational forecasting, machine learning is emerging as a powerful alternative for fast, flexible, and scalable predictions. We introduce PeakWeather, a high-quality dataset of surface weather observations collected every 10 minutes over more than 8 years from the ground stations of the Federal Office of Meteorology and Climatology MeteoSwiss's measurement network. The dataset includes a diverse set of meteorological variables from 302 station locations distributed across Switzerland's complex topography and is complemented with topographical indices derived from digital height models for context. Ensemble forecasts from the currently operational high-resolution NWP model are provided as a baseline forecast against which to evaluate new approaches. The dataset's richness supports a broad spectrum of spatiotemporal tasks, including time series forecasting at various scales, graph structure learning, imputation, and virtual sensing. As such, PeakWeather serves as a real-world benchmark to advance both foundational machine learning research, meteorology, and sensor-based applications.</p></details> |  |

However, we contend that existing benchmarks exhibit common limitations in four dimensions: constrained data composition dominated by reused legacy sources, compromised data integrity lacking rigorous quality assurance, misaligned task formulations detached from real-world contexts, and rigid analysis perspectives that obscure generalizable insights. To bridge these gaps, we introduce TIME, a next-generation task-centric benchmark comprising 50 fresh datasets and 98 forecasting tasks, tailored for strict zero-shot TSFM evaluation free from data leakage. Integrating large language models and human expertise, we establish a rigorous human-in-the-loop benchmark construction pipeline to ensure high data integrity and redefine task formulation by aligning forecasting configurations with real-world operational requirements and variate predictability. Furthermore, we propose a novel pattern-level evaluation perspective that moves beyond traditional dataset-level evaluations based on static meta labels. By leveraging structural time series features to characterize intrinsic temporal properties, this approach offers generalizable insights into model capabilities across diverse patterns. We evaluate 12 representative TSFMs and establish a multi-granular leaderboard to facilitate in-depth analysis and visualized inspection. The leaderboard is available at https://huggingface.co/spaces/Real-TSF/TIME-leaderboard.</p></details> | <details><summary>The s...</summary><p>The source code will be released on GitHub shortly</p></details> |

However, they assume uniform time intervals and therefore struggle with irregular time series. Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (NODEs) effectively handle irregular time series by modelling hidden states as continuously evolving trajectories. ContiFormers arxiv:2402.10635 combine NODEs with Transformers, but inherit the computational bottleneck of the former by using heavy numerical solvers. This bottleneck can be removed by using a closed-form solution for the given dynamical system - but this is known to be intractable in general! We obviate this by replacing NODEs with a novel linear damped harmonic oscillator analogy - which has a known closed-form solution. We model keys and values as damped, driven oscillators and expand the query in a sinusoidal basis up to a suitable number of modes. This analogy naturally captures the query-key coupling that is fundamental to any transformer architecture by modelling attention as a resonance phenomenon. Our closed-form solution eliminates the computational overhead of numerical ODE solvers while preserving expressivity. We prove that this oscillator-based parameterisation maintains the universal approximation property of continuous-time attention; specifically, any discrete attention matrix realisable by ContiFormer's continuous keys can be approximated arbitrarily well by our fixed oscillator modes. Our approach delivers both theoretical guarantees and scalability, achieving state-of-the-art performance on irregular time series benchmarks while being orders of magnitude faster.</p></details> |  |

However, enrolment forecasting in higher education is often data-sparse; annual series are short and affected by reporting changes and regime shifts. Popular classical approaches can be unreliable, as parameter estimation and model selection are unstable with short samples, and structural breaks degrade extrapolation. Recently, TSFMs have provided zero-shot priors, delivering strong gains in annual, data-sparse institutional forecasting under leakage-disciplined covariate construction. We benchmark multiple TSFM families in a zero-shot setting and test a compact, leakage-safe covariate set and introduce the Institutional Operating Conditions Index (IOCI), a transferable 0-100 regime covariate derived from time-stamped documentary evidence available at each forecast origin, alongside Google Trends demand proxies with stabilising feature engineering. Using an expanding-window backtest with strict vintage alignment, covariate-conditioned TSFMs perform on par with classical benchmarks without institution-specific training, with performance differences varying by cohort and model.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages, 5 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |
| **[Empirical Gaussian Processes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12082v1)** | 2026-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Gaussian processes (GPs) are powerful and widely used probabilistic regression models, but their effectiveness in practice is often limited by the choice of kernel function. This kernel function is typically handcrafted from a small set of standard functions, a process that requires expert knowledge, results in limited adaptivity to data, and imposes strong assumptions on the hypothesis space. We study Empirical GPs, a principled framework for constructing flexible, data-driven GP priors that overcome these limitations. Rather than relying on standard parametric kernels, we estimate the mean and covariance functions empirically from a corpus of historical observations, enabling the prior to reflect rich, non-trivial covariance structures present in the data. Theoretically, we show that the resulting model converges to the GP that is closest (in KL-divergence sense) to the real data generating process. Practically, we formulate the problem of learning the GP prior from independent datasets as likelihood estimation and derive an Expectation-Maximization algorithm with closed-form updates, allowing the model handle heterogeneous observation locations across datasets. We demonstrate that Empirical GPs achieve competitive performance on learning curve extrapolation and time series forecasting benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

Here, we introduce BrainSymphony, a lightweight and parameter-efficient foundation model with plug-and-play integration of fMRI time series and diffusion-derived structural connectivity, allowing unimodal or multimodal training and deployment without architectural changes while requiring substantially less data compared to the state-of-the-art. The model processes fMRI time series through parallel spatial and temporal transformer streams, distilled into compact embeddings by a Perceiver module, while a novel signed graph transformer encodes anatomical connectivity from diffusion MRI. These complementary representations are then combined through an adaptive fusion mechanism. Despite its compact design, BrainSymphony consistently outperforms larger models on benchmarks spanning prediction, classification, and unsupervised network discovery. Highlighting the model's generalizability and interpretability, attention maps reveal drug-induced context-dependent reorganization of cortical hierarchies in an independent psilocybin neuroimaging dataset. BrainSymphony delivers accessible, interpretable, and clinically meaningful results and demonstrates that architecturally informed, multimodal models can surpass much larger counterparts and advance applications of AI in neuroscience.</p></details> | 32 pages, 14 figures |
| **[Temporally Unified Adversarial Perturbations for Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11940v1)** | 2026-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While deep learning models have achieved remarkable success in time series forecasting, their vulnerability to adversarial examples remains a critical security concern. However, existing attack methods in the forecasting field typically ignore the temporal consistency inherent in time series data, leading to divergent and contradictory perturbation values for the same timestamp across overlapping samples. This temporally inconsistent perturbations problem renders adversarial attacks impractical for real-world data manipulation. To address this, we introduce Temporally Unified Adversarial Perturbations (TUAPs), which enforce a temporal unification constraint to ensure identical perturbations for each timestamp across all overlapping samples. Moreover, we propose a novel Timestamp-wise Gradient Accumulation Method (TGAM) that provides a modular and efficient approach to effectively generate TUAPs by aggregating local gradient information from overlapping samples. By integrating TGAM with momentum-based attack algorithms, we ensure strict temporal consistency while fully utilizing series-level gradient information to explore the adversarial perturbation space. Comprehensive experiments on three benchmark datasets and four representative state-of-the-art models demonstrate that our proposed method significantly outperforms baselines in both white-box and black-box transfer attack scenarios under TUAP constraints. Moreover, our method also exhibits superior transfer attack performance even without TUAP constraints, demonstrating its effectiveness and superiority in generating adversarial perturbations for time series forecasting models.</p></details> |  |

While deep learning models have proven to be relatively more effective than traditional statistical methods for time series forecasting, their reliability is not satisfactory due to their inability to effectively handle unique characteristics of network traffic. In particular, the burst and complex traffic patterns makes the existing models less reliable, as each type of deep learning model has limited capability in capturing traffic patterns. To address this issue, we introduce TUBO, a novel machine learning framework custom designed for reliable network traffic forecasting. TUBO features two key components: burst processing for handling significant traffic fluctuations and model selection for adapting to varying traffic patterns using a pool of models. A standout feature of TUBO is its ability to provide deterministic predictions along with quantified uncertainty, which serves as a cue for identifying the most reliable forecasts. Evaluations on three real-world network demand matrix (DM) datasets (Abilene, GEANT, and CERNET) show that TUBO significantly outperforms existing methods on forecasting accuracy (by 4 times), and also achieves up to 94% accuracy in burst occurrence forecasting. Furthermore, we also consider traffic demand forecasting based proactive traffic engineering (TE) as a downstream use case. Our results show that compared to reactive approaches and proactive TE using the best existing DM forecasting methods, proactive TE powered by TUBO improves aggregated throughput by 9 times and 3 times, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>Short...</summary><p>Short version of this paper is presented at ICDCS 2025</p></details> |

Existing Neural Controlled Differential Equation (Neural CDE) approaches, while effective at modelling continuous dynamics, suffer from slow, inherently sequential computation, which restricts scalability and limits access to global context. We introduce UFO (U-Former ODE), a novel architecture that seamlessly integrates the parallelizable, multiscale feature extraction of U-Nets, the powerful global modelling of Transformers, and the continuous-time dynamics of Neural CDEs. By constructing a fully causal, parallelizable model, UFO achieves a global receptive field while retaining strong sensitivity to local temporal dynamics. Extensive experiments on five standard benchmarks -- covering both regularly and irregularly sampled time series -- demonstrate that UFO consistently outperforms ten state-of-the-art neural baselines in predictive accuracy. Moreover, UFO delivers up to 15$\times$ faster inference compared to conventional Neural CDEs, with consistently strong performance on long and highly multivariate sequences.</p></details> |  |

We propose AdaptiveTrend, a multi-component algorithmic trading framework that integrates high-frequency trend-following on 6-hour intervals with monthly adaptive portfolio construction and asymmetric long-short capital allocation. Our framework introduces three key innovations: (1) a dynamic trailing stop mechanism calibrated to intra-day volatility regimes, (2) a rolling Sharpe-ratio-based asset selection procedure with market-capitalization-aware filtering, and (3) a theoretically motivated asymmetric 70/30 long-short allocation scheme grounded in the empirical positive drift of crypto markets. Through extensive out-of-sample backtesting across 150+ cryptocurrency pairs over a 36-month evaluation window (2022-2024), AdaptiveTrend achieves an annualized Sharpe ratio of 2.41, a maximum drawdown of -12.7%, and a Calmar ratio of 3.18, significantly outperforming benchmark trend-following strategies (TSMOM, time-series momentum) and equal-weighted buy-and-hold portfolios. We further conduct rigorous robustness analyses including parameter sensitivity, transaction cost modeling, and regime-conditional performance decomposition, demonstrating the strategy's resilience across bull, bear, and sideways market conditions.</p></details> |  |

Identifying gait patterns linked to these injuries can improve clinical decision-making, which requires precise systems capable of capturing and analyzing temporal kinematic data. This study uses optical motion capture systems to enhance detection of injury-related running patterns. We analyze a public dataset of 839 treadmill recordings from healthy and injured runners to evaluate how effectively these systems capture dynamic parameters relevant to injury classification. The focus is on the stance phase, using joint and segment angle time series and discrete point values. Three classification tasks are addressed: healthy vs. injured, healthy vs. PFPS, and healthy vs. ITBS. We examine different feature spaces, from traditional point-based metrics to full stance-phase time series and hybrid representations. Multiple models are tested, including classical algorithms (K-Nearest Neighbors, Gaussian Processes, Decision Trees) and deep learning architectures (CNNs, LSTMs). Performance is evaluated with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Explainability tools such as Shapley values, saliency maps, and Grad-CAM are used to interpret model behavior. Results show that combining time series with point values substantially improves detection. Deep learning models outperform classical ones, with CNNs achieving the highest accuracy: 77.9% for PFPS, 73.8% for ITBS, and 71.43% for the combined injury class. These findings highlight the potential of motion capture systems coupled with advanced machine learning to identify knee injury-related running patterns.</p></details> |  |

However, the highly volatile and nonlinear nature of OEE time series--particularly in complex production lines and hydraulic press systems--limits the effectiveness of forecasting. This study proposes a novel informational framework that leverages Topological Data Analysis (TDA) to transform raw OEE data into structured engineering knowledge for production management. The framework models hourly OEE data from production lines and systems using persistent homology to extract large-scale topological features that characterize intrinsic operational behaviors. These features are integrated into a SARIMAX (Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average with Exogenous Regressors) architecture, where TDA components serve as exogenous variables to capture latent temporal structures. Experimental results demonstrate forecasting accuracy improvements of at least 17% over standard seasonal benchmarks, with Heat Kernel-based features consistently identified as the most effective predictors. The proposed framework was deployed in a Global Lighthouse Network manufacturing facility, providing a new strategic layer for production management and achieving a 7.4% improvement in total OEE. This research contributes a formal methodology for embedding topological signatures into classical stochastic models to enhance decision-making in knowledge-intensive production systems.</p></details> | 44 pages |

Existing solutions face a trade-off: Parametric Adaptation can cause catastrophic forgetting and requires costly multi-domain maintenance, while Non-Parametric Retrieval improves forecasts but incurs high inference latency due to datastore search. We propose Parametric Memory Distillation and implement it as TS-Memory, a lightweight memory adapter that augments frozen TSFMs. TS-Memory is trained in two stages. First, we construct an offline, leakage-safe kNN teacher that synthesizes confidence-aware quantile targets from retrieved futures. Second, we distill this retrieval-induced distributional correction into a lightweight memory adapter via confidence-gated supervision. During inference, TS-Memory fuses memory and backbone predictions with constant-time overhead, enabling retrieval-free deployment. Experiments across diverse TSFMs and benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements in both point and probabilistic forecasting over representative adaptation methods, with efficiency comparable to the frozen backbone.</p></details> |  |

We argue that fitting a single model to capture both effects creates an optimization conflict: the high-variance updates needed for cross-dimension modeling can corrupt the gradients that support autoregression, resulting in brittle training and degraded long-horizon accuracy. To address this, we propose ALTTS, a dual-path framework that explicitly decouples autoregression and cross-relation (CR) modeling. In ALTTS, the AR path is instantiated with a linear predictor, while the CR path uses a Transformer equipped with Cross-Relation Self-Attention (CRSA); the two branches are coordinated via alternating optimization to isolate gradient noise and reduce cross-block interference. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks show that ALTTS consistently outperforms prior methods, with the most pronounced improvements on long-horizon forecasting. Overall, our results suggest that carefully designed optimization strategies, rather than ever more complex architectures, can be a key driver of progress in multivariate time series forecasting.</p></details> | Preprint |

Prior claims of dominance of the linear model often stem from benchmarks that lack diverse temporal dynamics and employ biased evaluation protocols. We revisit this debate through TimeSynth, a structured framework that emulates key properties of real world time series,including non-stationarity, periodicity, trends, and phase modulation by creating synthesized signals whose parameters are derived from real-world time series. Evaluating four model families Linear, Multi Layer Perceptrons (MLP), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), and Transformers, we find a systematic bias in linear models: they collapse to simple oscillation regardless of signal complexity. Nonlinear models avoid this collapse and gain clear advantages as signal complexity increases. Notably, Transformers and CNN based models exhibit slightly greater adaptability to complex modulated signals compared to MLPs. Beyond clean forecasting, the framework highlights robustness differences under distribution and noise shifts and removes biases of prior benchmarks by using independent instances for train, test, and validation for each signal family. Collectively, TimeSynth provides a principled foundation for understanding when different forecasting approaches succeed or fail, moving beyond oversimplified claims of model equivalence.</p></details> |  |

We explore strategies for designing such portfolios and find that collections of specialist models consistently outperform portfolios of independently trained generalists. Remarkably, we demonstrate that post-training a base model is a compute-effective approach for creating sufficiently diverse specialists, and provide evidences that ensembling and model selection are more compute-efficient than test-time fine-tuning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as an ICLR 2026 conference paper</p></details> |

We utilize the Cayley transform to decompose the parametric covariance matrix, which in turn allows us to formulate a general data generating algorithm for Gaussian data. Leveraging constrained generalized fiducial inference, we are able to create the basis of an MCMC algorithm, which can be specified to parametric models with minimal effort. The appeal of this novel approach is the wide class of models which it permits, ease of implementation and the posterior-like fiducial distribution without the need for a prior. We provide background information for the derivation of the relevant fiducial quantities, and a proof that the proposed MCMC algorithm targets the correct fiducial distribution. We need not assume independence nor identical distribution of the data, which makes the method attractive for application to time series and spatial data. Well-performing simulation results of the MA(1) and Matérn models are presented.</p></details> |  |

We study this problem in full-body human motion, where large-scale data collection is infeasible but essential for wearable-based Human Activity Recognition (HAR), and where synthetic motion can be generated from motion-capture-derived representations. We pretrain motion time-series models using such synthetic data and evaluate their transfer across diverse downstream HAR tasks. Our results show that synthetic pretraining improves generalisation when mixed with real data or scaled sufficiently. We also demonstrate that large-scale motion-capture pretraining yields only marginal gains due to domain mismatch with wearable signals, clarifying key sim-to-real challenges and the limits and opportunities of synthetic motion data for transferable HAR representations.</p></details> |  |

Specifically, KOWCPI adapts the classic Reweighted Nadaraya-Watson (RNW) estimator for quantile regression on dependent data and learns optimal data-adaptive weights. Theoretically, we tackle the challenge of establishing a conditional coverage guarantee for non-exchangeable data under strong mixing conditions on the non-conformity scores. We demonstrate the superior performance of KOWCPI on real and synthetic time-series data against state-of-the-art methods, where KOWCPI achieves narrower confidence intervals without losing coverage.</p></details> |  |

However, existing forecasting systems often fail during high-impact periods such as flash sales, holiday campaigns, and sudden policy interventions, where demand patterns shift abruptly and unpredictably. In this paper, we introduce EventCast, a modular forecasting framework that integrates future event knowledge into time-series prediction. Unlike prior approaches that ignore future interventions or directly use large language models (LLMs) for numerical forecasting, EventCast leverages LLMs solely for event-driven reasoning. Unstructured business data, which covers campaigns, holiday schedules, and seller incentives, from existing operational databases, is processed by an LLM that converts it into interpretable textual summaries leveraging world knowledge for cultural nuances and novel event combinations. These summaries are fused with historical demand features within a dual-tower architecture, enabling accurate, explainable, and scalable forecasts.

A practical alternative to reduce computational and memory overhead is to perform BPTT repeatedly over shorter segments of the training data set, corresponding to truncated BPTT. In this paper, we examine the training of RNNs when using such a truncated learning approach for time series tasks. Specifically, we establish theoretical bounds on the accuracy and performance loss when optimizing over subsequences instead of the full data sequence. This reveals that the burn-in phase of the RNN is an important tuning knob in its training, with significant impact on the performance guarantees. We validate our theoretical results through experiments on standard benchmarks from the fields of system identification and time series forecasting. In all experiments, we observe a strong influence of the burn-in phase on the training process, and proper tuning can lead to a reduction of the prediction error on the training and test data of more than 60% in some cases.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2026, https://openreview.net/forum?id=jwkdKpioHJ</p></details> |
| **[Time Series Foundation Models for Energy Load Forecasting on Consumer Hardware: A Multi-Dimensional Zero-Shot Benchmark](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10848v1)** | 2026-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) have introduced zero-shot prediction capabilities that bypass the need for task-specific training. Whether these capabilities translate to mission-critical applications such as electricity demand forecasting--where accuracy, calibration, and robustness directly affect grid operations--remains an open question. We present a multi-dimensional benchmark evaluating four TSFMs (Chronos-Bolt, Chronos-2, Moirai-2, and TinyTimeMixer) alongside Prophet as an industry-standard baseline and two statistical references (SARIMA and Seasonal Naive), using ERCOT hourly load data from 2020 to 2024. All experiments run on consumer-grade hardware (AMD Ryzen 7, 16GB RAM, no GPU). The evaluation spans four axes: (1) context length sensitivity from 24 to 2048 hours, (2) probabilistic forecast calibration, (3) robustness under distribution shifts including COVID-19 lockdowns and Winter Storm Uri, and (4) prescriptive analytics for operational decision support. The top-performing foundation models achieve MASE values near 0.31 at long context lengths (C = 2048h, day-ahead horizon), a 47% reduction over the Seasonal Naive baseline. The inclusion of Prophet exposes a structural advantage of pre-trained models: Prophet fails when the fitting window is shorter than its seasonality period (MASE > 74 at 24-hour context), while TSFMs maintain stable accuracy even with minimal context because they recognise temporal patterns learned during pre-training rather than estimating them from scratch. Calibration varies substantially across models--Chronos-2 produces well-calibrated prediction intervals (95% empirical coverage at 90% nominal level) while both Moirai-2 and Prophet exhibit overconfidence (~70% coverage). We provide practical model selection guidelines and release the complete benchmark framework for reproducibility.</p></details> | 27 pages, 13 figures |
| **[Enhancing Multivariate Time Series Forecasting with Global Temporal Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10847v1)** | 2026-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multivariate time series forecasting (MTSF) plays a vital role in numerous real-world applications, yet existing models remain constrained by their reliance on a limited historical context. This limitation prevents them from effectively capturing global periodic patterns that often span cycles significantly longer than the input horizon - despite such patterns carrying strong predictive signals. Naive solutions, such as extending the historical window, lead to severe drawbacks, including overfitting, prohibitive computational costs, and redundant information processing. To address these challenges, we introduce the Global Temporal Retriever (GTR), a lightweight and plug-and-play module designed to extend any forecasting model's temporal awareness beyond the immediate historical context. GTR maintains an adaptive global temporal embedding of the entire cycle and dynamically retrieves and aligns relevant global segments with the input sequence. By jointly modeling local and global dependencies through a 2D convolution and residual fusion, GTR effectively bridges short-term observations with long-term periodicity without altering the host model architecture. Extensive experiments on six real-world datasets demonstrate that GTR consistently delivers state-of-the-art performance across both short-term and long-term forecasting scenarios, while incurring minimal parameter and computational overhead. These results highlight GTR as an efficient and general solution for enhancing global periodicity modeling in MTSF tasks. Code is available at this repository: https://github.com/macovaseas/GTR.</p></details> | ICLR 2026 |

Discussion includes core theoretical aspects and summaries of existing Bayesian methodology for forward filtering and forecasting with SGDLMs. The review is complemented by new theory linking dynamic graphical and factor models, and extensions of the Bayesian methodology. This addresses graphical structure uncertainty via model marginal likelihood evaluation, and analysis with missing data relevant to counterfactual analysis. The latter advances the ability to scale causal analysis to higher-dimensional time series. Aspects of the theory and methodology are exemplified in a global macroeconomic time series study with time-varying cross-series relationships and primary interests in potential causal effects. The example highlights the utility of SGDLMs with insights generated by the theoretical structure of these models, and benefits of fully Bayesian assessment of post-intervention outcomes in causal time series studies as in prediction more generally.</p></details> | <details><summary>34 pa...</summary><p>34 pages and 13 figures</p></details> |
| **[MTBench: A Multimodal Time Series Benchmark for Temporal Reasoning and Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16858v2)** | 2026-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding the relationship between textual news and time-series evolution is a critical yet under-explored challenge in applied data science. While multimodal learning has gained traction, existing multimodal time-series datasets fall short in evaluating cross-modal reasoning and complex question answering, which are essential for capturing complex interactions between narrative information and temporal patterns. To bridge this gap, we introduce Multimodal Time Series Benchmark (MTBench), a large-scale benchmark designed to evaluate large language models (LLMs) on time series and text understanding across financial and weather domains. MTbench comprises paired time series and textual data, including financial news with corresponding stock price movements and weather reports aligned with historical temperature records. Unlike existing benchmarks that focus on isolated modalities, MTbench provides a comprehensive testbed for models to jointly reason over structured numerical trends and unstructured textual narratives. The richness of MTbench enables formulation of diverse tasks that require a deep understanding of both text and time-series data, including time-series forecasting, semantic and technical trend analysis, and news-driven question answering (QA). These tasks target the model's ability to capture temporal dependencies, extract key insights from textual context, and integrate cross-modal information. We evaluate state-of-the-art LLMs on MTbench, analyzing their effectiveness in modeling the complex relationships between news narratives and temporal patterns. Our findings reveal significant challenges in current models, including difficulties in capturing long-term dependencies, interpreting causality in financial and weather trends, and effectively fusing multimodal information.</p></details> | 18 pages |

Synthetic data produced by generative artificial intelligence (genAI) models trained on real data is often seen as one possible solution to comply with privacy regulations. While powerful genAI models for heterogeneous hospital time series have recently been introduced, such modeling does not guarantee privacy protection, as the generated data may still reveal identifying information about individuals in the models' training cohort. Applying established privacy mechanisms to generative time series models, however, proves challenging as post-hoc data anonymization through k-anonymization or similar techniques is limited, while model-centered privacy mechanisms that implement differential privacy (DP) may lead to unstable training, compromising the utility of generated data. Given these known limitations, privacy audits for generative time series models are currently indispensable regardless of the concrete privacy mechanisms applied to models and/or data. In this work, we use a battery of established privacy attacks to audit state-of-the-art hospital time series models, trained on the public MIMIC-IV dataset, with respect to privacy preservation. Furthermore, the eICU dataset was used to mount a privacy attack against the synthetic data generator trained on the MIMIC-IV dataset. Results show that established privacy attacks are ineffective against generated multivariate clinical time series when synthetic data generators are trained on large enough training datasets. Furthermore, we discuss how the use of existing DP mechanisms for these synthetic data generators would not bring desired improvement in privacy, but only a decrease in utility for machine learning prediction tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Semantic-Enhanced Time-Series Forecasting via Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07697v4)** | 2026-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting plays a significant role in finance, energy, meteorology, and IoT applications. Recent studies have leveraged the generalization capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to adapt to time series forecasting, achieving promising performance. However, existing studies focus on token-level modal alignment, instead of bridging the intrinsic modality gap between linguistic knowledge structures and time series data patterns, greatly limiting the semantic representation. To address this issue, we propose a novel Semantic-Enhanced LLM (SE-LLM) that explores the inherent periodicity and anomalous characteristics of time series to embed into the semantic space to enhance the token embedding. This process enhances the interpretability of tokens for LLMs, thereby activating the potential of LLMs for temporal sequence analysis. Moreover, existing Transformer-based LLMs excel at capturing long-range dependencies but are weak at modeling short-term anomalies in time-series data. Hence, we propose a plugin module embedded within self-attention that models long-term and short-term dependencies to effectively adapt LLMs to time-series analysis. Our approach freezes the LLM and reduces the sequence dimensionality of tokens, greatly reducing computational consumption. Experiments demonstrate the superiority performance of our SE-LLM against the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.</p></details> | 18 pages,6 figures |

Accurate assessment is vital for adaptive learning, clinical monitoring, and brain-computer interfaces. Physiological signals such as pupillometry and electroencephalography are established biomarkers of cognitive load, but their comparative utility and practical integration as lightweight, wearable monitoring solutions remain underexplored. EEG provides high temporal resolution of neural activity. Although non-invasive, it is technologically demanding and limited in wearability and cost due to its resource-intensive nature, whereas pupillometry is non-invasive, portable, and scalable. Existing studies often rely on deep learning models with limited interpretability and substantial computational expense. This study integrates feature-based and model-driven approaches to advance time-series analysis. Using the OpenNeuro 'Digit Span Task' dataset, this study investigates cognitive load classification from EEG and pupillometry. Feature-based approaches using Catch-22 features and classical machine learning models outperform deep learning in both binary and multiclass tasks. The findings demonstrate that pupillometry alone can compete with EEG, serving as a portable and practical proxy for real-world applications. These results challenge the assumption that EEG is necessary for load detection, showing that pupil dynamics combined with interpretable models and SHAP based feature analysis provide physiologically meaningful insights. This work supports the development of wearable, affordable cognitive monitoring systems for neuropsychiatry, education, and healthcare.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 Pag...</summary><p>6 Pages, 3 Figures, 5 Tables, Code Available at: https://github.com/NusaibahFarrukh/PupillometryBrainDynamics</p></details> |
| **[Bridging the Compression-Precision Paradox: A Hybrid Architecture for Clinical EEG Report Generation with Guaranteed Measurement Accuracy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10544v1)** | 2026-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated EEG monitoring requires clinician-level precision for seizure detection and reporting. Clinical EEG recordings exceed LLM context windows, requiring extreme compression (400:1+ ratios) that destroys fine-grained temporal precision. A 0.5 Hz error distinguishes absence epilepsy from Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. LLMs lack inherent time-series comprehension and rely on statistical associations from compressed representations. This dual limitation causes systems to hallucinate clinically incorrect measurement values. We separate measurement extraction from text generation. Our hybrid architecture computes exact clinical values via signal processing before compression, employs a cross-modal bridge for EEG-to-language translation, and uses parameter-efficient fine-tuning with constrained decoding around frozen slots. Multirate sampling maintains long-range context while preserving event-level precision. Evaluation on TUH and CHB-MIT datasets achieves 60% fewer false alarms, 50% faster detection, and sub-clinical measurement precision. This is the first system guaranteeing clinical measurement accuracy in automated EEG reports.</p></details> | 7 pages |
| **[Multi-modal Gaussian Process Variational Autoencoders for Neural and Behavioral Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03111v2)** | 2026-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Characterizing the relationship between neural population activity and behavioral data is a central goal of neuroscience. While latent variable models (LVMs) are successful in describing high-dimensional time-series data, they are typically only designed for a single type of data, making it difficult to identify structure shared across different experimental data modalities. Here, we address this shortcoming by proposing an unsupervised LVM which extracts temporally evolving shared and independent latents for distinct, simultaneously recorded experimental modalities. We do this by combining Gaussian Process Factor Analysis (GPFA), an interpretable LVM for neural spiking data with temporally smooth latent space, with Gaussian Process Variational Autoencoders (GP-VAEs), which similarly use a GP prior to characterize correlations in a latent space, but admit rich expressivity due to a deep neural network mapping to observations. We achieve interpretability in our model by partitioning latent variability into components that are either shared between or independent to each modality. We parameterize the latents of our model in the Fourier domain, and show improved latent identification using this approach over standard GP-VAE methods. We validate our model on simulated multi-modal data consisting of Poisson spike counts and MNIST images that scale and rotate smoothly over time. We show that the multi-modal GP-VAE (MM-GPVAE) is able to not only identify the shared and independent latent structure across modalities accurately, but provides good reconstructions of both images and neural rates on held-out trials. Finally, we demonstrate our framework on two real world multi-modal experimental settings: Drosophila whole-brain calcium imaging alongside tracked limb positions, and Manduca sexta spike train measurements from ten wing muscles as the animal tracks a visual stimulus.</p></details> | <details><summary>Updat...</summary><p>Updated version published in ICLR 2024</p></details> |

We introduce LightGTS-Cov, a covariate-enhanced extension of LightGTS that preserves its lightweight, period-aware backbone while explicitly incorporating both past and future-known covariates. Built on a $\sim$1M-parameter LightGTS backbone, LightGTS-Cov adds only a $\sim$0.1M-parameter MLP plug-in that integrates time-aligned covariates into the target forecasts by residually refining the outputs of the decoding process. Across covariate-aware benchmarks on electricity price and energy generation datasets, LightGTS-Cov consistently outperforms LightGTS and achieves superior performance over other covariate-aware baselines under both settings, regardless of whether future-known covariates are provided. We further demonstrate its practical value in two real-world energy case applications: long-term photovoltaic power forecasting with future weather forecasts and day-ahead electricity price forecasting with weather and dispatch-plan covariates. Across both applications, LightGTS-Cov achieves strong forecasting accuracy and stable operational performance after deployment, validating its effectiveness in real-world industrial settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Time-to-Event Transformer to Capture Timing Attention of Events in EHR Time Series](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10385v1)** | 2026-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automatically discovering personalized sequential events from large-scale time-series data is crucial for enabling precision medicine in clinical research, yet it remains a formidable challenge even for contemporary AI models. For example, while transformers capture rich associations, they are mostly agnostic to event timing and ordering, thereby bypassing potential causal reasoning. Intuitively, we need a method capable of evaluating the "degree of alignment" among patient-specific trajectories and identifying their shared patterns, i.e., the significant events in a consistent sequence. This necessitates treating timing as a true \emph{computable} dimension, allowing models to assign ``relative timestamps'' to candidate events beyond their observed physical times. In this work, we introduce LITT, a novel Timing-Transformer architecture that enables temporary alignment of sequential events on a virtual ``relative timeline'', thereby enabling \emph{event-timing-focused attention} and personalized interpretations of clinical trajectories. Its interpretability and effectiveness are validated on real-world longitudinal EHR data from 3,276 breast cancer patients to predict the onset timing of cardiotoxicity-induced heart disease. Furthermore, LITT outperforms both the benchmark and state-of-the-art survival analysis methods on public datasets, positioning it as a significant step forward for precision medicine in clinical AI.</p></details> | 7 pages of body text |

Improving our ability to produce and handle tensors is essential to efficiently address problems in these domains. In this paper, we show how to exploit the underlying symmetries of functions that map tensors to tensors. More concretely, we develop universally expressive equivariant machine learning architectures on tensors that exploit that, in many cases, these tensor functions are equivariant with respect to the diagonal action of the orthogonal, Lorentz, and/or symplectic groups. We showcase our results on three problems coming from material science, theoretical computer science, and time series analysis. For time series, we combine our method with the increasingly popular path signatures approach, which is also invariant with respect to reparameterizations. Our numerical experiments show that our equivariant models perform better than corresponding non-equivariant baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>40 pa...</summary><p>40 pages, 1 figure.

| **[Modewise Additive Factor Model for Matrix Time Series](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.25025v2)** | 2026-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a Modewise Additive Factor Model (MAFM) for matrix-valued time series that captures row-specific and column-specific latent effects through an additive structure, offering greater flexibility than multiplicative frameworks such as Tucker and CP factor models. In MAFM, each observation decomposes into a row-factor component, a column-factor component, and noise, allowing distinct sources of variation along different modes to be modeled separately. We develop a computationally efficient two-stage estimation procedure: Modewise Inner-product Eigendecomposition (MINE) for initialization, followed by Complement-Projected Alternating Subspace Estimation (COMPAS) for iterative refinement. The key methodological innovation is that orthogonal complement projections completely eliminate cross-modal interference when estimating each loading space. We establish convergence rates for the estimated factor loading matrices under proper conditions. We further derive asymptotic distributions for the loading matrix estimators and develop consistent covariance estimators, yielding a data-driven inference framework that enables confidence interval construction and hypothesis testing. As a technical contribution of independent interest, we establish matrix Bernstein inequalities for quadratic forms of dependent matrix time series. Numerical experiments on synthetic and real data demonstrate the advantages of the proposed method over existing approaches.</p></details> |  |

| **[Online Monitoring Framework for Automotive Time Series Data using JEPA Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09985v1)** | 2026-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As autonomous vehicles are rolled out, measures must be taken to ensure their safe operation. In order to supervise a system that is already in operation, monitoring frameworks are frequently employed. These run continuously online in the background, supervising the system status and recording anomalies. This work proposes an online monitoring framework to detect anomalies in object state representations. Thereby, a key challenge is creating a framework for anomaly detection without anomaly labels, which are usually unavailable for unknown anomalies. To address this issue, this work applies a self-supervised embedding method to translate object data into a latent representation space. For this, a JEPA-based self-supervised prediction task is constructed, allowing training without anomaly labels and the creation of rich object embeddings. The resulting expressive JEPA embeddings serve as input for established anomaly detection methods, in order to identify anomalies within object state representations. This framework is particularly useful for applications in real-world environments, where new or unknown anomalies may occur during operation for which there are no labels available. Experiments performed on the publicly available, real-world nuScenes dataset illustrate the framework's capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the 2026 IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium.

We believe they hold strong promise for this domain. To unlock this potential, we explicitly align past and future representations, thereby bridging the distributional gap between input histories and future targets. To this end, we introduce TimeAlign, a lightweight, plug-and-play framework that establishes a new representation paradigm, distinct from contrastive learning, by aligning auxiliary features via a simple reconstruction task and feeding them back into any base forecaster. Extensive experiments across eight benchmarks verify its superior performance. Further studies indicate that the gains arise primarily from correcting frequency mismatches between historical inputs and future outputs. Additionally, we provide two theoretical justifications for how reconstruction improves forecasting generalization and how alignment increases the mutual information between learned representations and predicted targets.

Using synthetically generated processes with known temporal and cross-sectional dependency structures and varying signal-to-noise ratios, we conduct bootstrapped experiments that enable direct evaluation via out-of-sample correlations with the optimal ground-truth predictor. We show that two-way attention transformers, which alternate between temporal and cross-sectional self-attention, can outperform standard baselines-Lasso, boosting methods, and fully connected multilayer perceptrons-across a wide range of settings, including low signal-to-noise regimes. We further introduce a dynamic sparsification procedure for attention matrices applied during training, and demonstrate that it becomes significantly effective in noisy environments, where the correlation between the target variable and the optimal predictor is on the order of a few percent. Analysis of the learned attention patterns reveals interpretable structure and suggests connections to sparsity-inducing regularization in classical regression, providing insight into why these models generalize effectively under noise.</p></details> | Submitted to ICML |
| **[Bayesian identification of early warning signals for long-range dependent climatic time series](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09731v1)** | 2026-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Detecting early warning signals in climatic time series is essential for anticipating critical transitions and tipping points. Common statistical indicators include increased variance and lag-one autocorrelation prior to bifurcation points. However, these indicators are sensitive to observational noise, long-term mean trends, and long-memory dependence, all of which are prevalent in climatic time series. Such effects can easily obscure genuine signals or generate spurious detections. To address these challenges, we employ a flexible Bayesian framework for modelling time-varying autocorrelation in long-range dependent time series, also accounting for time-varying variance. The approach uses a mixture of two fractional Gaussian noise processes with a time-dependent weight function to represent fractional Gaussian noise with a time-varying Hurst exponent. Inference is performed via integrated nested Laplace approximation, enabling joint estimation of mean trends and handling of irregularly sampled observations. The strengths and limitations of detecting changes in the autocorrelation is investigated in extensive simulations. Applied to real climatic data sets, we find evidence of early warning signals in a reconstructed Atlantic multidecadal variability index, while dismissing such signals for paleoclimate records spanning the Dansgaard-Oeschger events.</p></details> | 27 pages, 9 figures |

Both are fundamentally limited by the common challenge of modeling long-range temporal dynamics. To explore how to improve the performance of methods on both tasks simultaneously by enhancing long-range temporal understanding capabilities, we introduce **TAMMs**, the first unified framework designed to jointly perform TCD and FSIF within a single MLLM-diffusion architecture. TAMMs introduces two key innovations: Temporal Adaptation Modules (**TAM**) enhance frozen MLLM's ability to comprehend long-range dynamics, and Semantic-Fused Control Injection (**SFCI**) mechanism translates this change understanding into fine-grained generative control. This synergistic design makes the understanding from the TCD task to directly inform and improve the consistency of the FSIF task. Extensive experiments demonstrate TAMMs significantly outperforms state-of-the-art specialist baselines on both tasks.

Anomaly detection in UTS plays an essential role in both data mining and system reliability management. However, existing reconstruction-based and prediction-based methods struggle to capture certain subtle anomalies, particularly small point anomalies and slowly rising anomalies. To address these challenges, we propose a novel prediction-based framework named Contextual and Seasonal LSTMs (CS-LSTMs). CS-LSTMs are built upon a noise decomposition strategy and jointly leverage contextual dependencies and seasonal patterns, thereby strengthening the detection of subtle anomalies. By integrating both time-domain and frequency-domain representations, CS-LSTMs achieve more accurate modeling of periodic trends and anomaly localization. Extensive evaluations on public benchmark datasets demonstrate that CS-LSTMs consistently outperform state-of-the-art methods, highlighting their effectiveness and practical value in robust time series anomaly detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2026</p></details> |

However, their effectiveness depends critically on the quality and structure of input representations derived from raw multivariate time-series data, particularly as sequence length and data scale increase. This paper proposes a two-stage forecasting framework that explicitly separates local temporal representation learning from global dependency modelling. In the proposed approach, a convolutional neural network operates on fixed-length temporal patches to extract short-range temporal dynamics and non-linear feature interactions, producing compact patch-level token embeddings. Token-level self-attention is applied during representation learning to refine these embeddings, after which a Transformer encoder models inter-patch temporal dependencies to generate forecasts. The method is evaluated on a synthetic multivariate time-series dataset with controlled static and dynamic factors, using an extended sequence length and a larger number of samples. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework consistently outperforms a convolutional baseline under increased temporal context and remains competitive with a strong patch-based Transformer model. These findings indicate that structured patch-level tokenization provides a scalable and effective representation for multivariate time-series forecasting, particularly when longer input sequences are considered.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 2 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

Typically powered by machine learning methods, predictive models are used in recommendations, financial fraud detection, supply chain optimization, and other systems, providing billions of predictions every day. However, training a machine learning model requires manual work to extract the required training examples - prediction entities and target labels - from the database, which is slow, laborious, and prone to mistakes. Here, we present the Predictive Query Language (PQL), a SQL-inspired declarative language for defining predictive tasks on relational databases. PQL allows specifying a predictive task in a single declarative query, enabling the automatic computation training labels for a large variety of machine learning tasks, such as regression, classification, time-series forecasting, and recommender systems. PQL is already successfully integrated and used in a collection of use cases as part of a predictive AI platform. The versatility of the language can be demonstrated through its many ongoing use cases, including financial fraud, item recommendations, and workload prediction. We demonstrate its versatile design through two implementations; one for small-scale, low-latency use and one that can handle large-scale databases.</p></details> |  |

By incorporating skewed t-distributions as mixture components, our approach offers enhanced flexibility in capturing the skewed, heavy-tailed, and potentially multimodal nature of predictive densities associated with bubble dynamics modeled by mixed causal-noncausal ARMA processes. In addition, we implement an adaptive weighting scheme that emphasizes tail observations during training and hence leads to accurate density estimation in the extreme regions most relevant for financial applications. Equally important, once trained, the MDN produces near-instantaneous density forecasts. Through extensive Monte Carlo simulations and two empirical applications, on the natural gas price and inflation, we show that the proposed MDN-based framework delivers superior forecasting performance relative to existing approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[Asymptotic Inference for Rank Correlations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14609v2)** | 2026-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Kendall's tau and Spearman's rho are widely used tools for measuring dependence. Surprisingly, when it comes to asymptotic inference for these rank correlations, some fundamental results and methods have not yet been developed, in particular for discrete random variables and in the time series case, and concerning variance estimation in general. Consequently, asymptotic confidence intervals are not available. We provide a comprehensive treatment of asymptotic inference for classical rank correlations, including Kendall's tau, Spearman's rho, Goodman-Kruskal's gamma, Kendall's tau-b, and grade correlation. We derive asymptotic distributions for both iid and time series data, resorting to asymptotic results for U-statistics, and introduce consistent variance estimators. This enables the construction of confidence intervals and tests, generalizes classical results for continuous random variables and leads to corrected versions of widely used tests of independence. We analyze the finite-sample performance of our variance estimators, confidence intervals, and tests in simulations and illustrate their use in case studies.</p></details> |  |
| **[SpikySpace: A Spiking State Space Model for Energy-Efficient Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02411v2)** | 2026-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time-series forecasting in domains like traffic management and industrial monitoring often requires real-time, energy-efficient processing on edge devices with limited resources. Spiking neural networks (SNNs) offer event-driven computation and ultra-low power and have been proposed for use in this space. Unfortunately, existing SNN-based time-series forecasters often use complex transformer blocks. To address this issue, we propose SpikySpace, a spiking state-space model (SSM) that reduces the quadratic cost in the attention block to linear time via spiking selective scanning. Further, we introduce PTsoftplus and PTSiLU, two efficient approximations of SiLU and Softplus that replace costly exponential and division operations with simple bit-shifts. Evaluated on four multivariate time-series benchmarks, SpikySpace outperforms the leading SNN in terms of accuracy by up to 3.0% while reducing energy consumption by over 96.1%. As the first fully spiking state-space model, SpikySpace bridges neuromorphic efficiency with modern sequence modeling, opening a practical path toward efficient time series forecasting systems. Our code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/SpikySpace.</p></details> | 17 pages, 4 figures |
| **[A Brain Graph Foundation Model: Pre-Training and Prompt-Tuning across Broad Atlases and Disorders](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02044v3)** | 2026-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As large language models (LLMs) continue to revolutionize AI research, there is a growing interest in building large-scale brain foundation models to advance neuroscience. While most existing brain foundation models are pre-trained on time-series signals or connectome features, we propose a novel graph-based pre-training paradigm for constructing a brain graph foundation model. In this paper, we introduce the Brain Graph Foundation Model, termed BrainGFM, a unified framework that leverages graph contrastive learning and graph masked autoencoders for large-scale fMRI-based pre-training. BrainGFM is pre-trained on a diverse mixture of brain atlases with varying parcellations, significantly expanding the pre-training corpus and enhancing the model's ability to generalize across heterogeneous fMRI-derived brain representations. To support efficient and versatile downstream transfer, we integrate both graph prompts and language prompts into the model design, enabling BrainGFM to flexibly adapt to a wide range of atlases, neurological and psychiatric disorders, and task settings. Furthermore, we employ meta-learning to optimize the graph prompts, facilitating strong generalization to previously unseen disorders under both few-shot and zero-shot learning conditions via language-guided prompting. BrainGFM is pre-trained on 27 neuroimaging datasets spanning 25 common neurological and psychiatric disorders, encompassing 2 types of brain atlases (functional and anatomical) across 8 widely-used parcellations, and covering over 25,000 subjects, 60,000 fMRI scans, and a total of 400,000 graph samples aggregated across all atlases and parcellations.</p></details> | 30pages |

However, such data are often difficult to obtain. Meanwhile, most existing trajectory generation methods implicitly assume that at least a subset of real mobility data from target city is available, which limits their applicability in data-inaccessible scenarios. In this work, we propose a new problem setting, called bus-conditioned zero-shot trajectory generation, where no mobility trajectories from a target city are accessible. The generation process relies solely on source city mobility data and publicly available bus timetables from both cities. Under this setting, we propose MobTA, the first approach to introduce task arithmetic into trajectory generation. MobTA models the parameter shift from bus-timetable-based trajectory generation to mobility trajectory generation in source city, and applies this shift to target city through arithmetic operations on task vectors. This enables trajectory generation that reflects target-city mobility patterns without requiring any real mobility data from it. Furthermore, we theoretically analyze MobTA's stability across base and instruction-tuned LLMs. Extensive experiments show that MobTA significantly outperforms existing methods, and achieves performance close to models finetuned using target city mobility trajectories.</p></details> |  |

Recent research aims to develop end-to-end models that jointly address perception and prediction; however, they often fail to fully exploit the synergy between appearance and motion cues, relying mainly on short-term visual features. We follow the idea of "looking backward to look forward", and propose MASAR, a novel fully differentiable framework for joint 3D detection and trajectory forecasting compatible with any transformer-based 3D detector. MASAR employs an object-centric spatio-temporal mechanism that jointly encodes appearance and motion features. By predicting past trajectories and refining them using guidance from appearance cues, MASAR captures long-term temporal dependencies that enhance future trajectory forecasting. Experiments conducted on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate MASAR's effectiveness, showing improvements of over 20% in minADE and minFDE while maintaining robust detection performance. Code and models are available at https://github.com/aminmed/MASAR.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the 2026 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA 2026)</p></details> |

Tracking how vortices move, weaken, and dissipate over time from LiDAR measurements is still difficult because scans are sparse, vortex signatures fade as the flow breaks down under atmospheric turbulence and instabilities, and point-wise annotation is prohibitively expensive. Existing approaches largely treat each scan as an independent, fully supervised segmentation problem, which overlooks temporal structure and does not scale to the vast unlabeled archives collected in practice. We present X-VORTEX, a spatio-temporal contrastive learning framework grounded in Augmentation Overlap Theory that learns physics-aware representations from unlabeled LiDAR point cloud sequences. X-VORTEX addresses two core challenges: sensor sparsity and time-varying vortex dynamics. It constructs paired inputs from the same underlying flight event by combining a weakly perturbed sequence with a strongly augmented counterpart produced via temporal subsampling and spatial masking, encouraging the model to align representations across missing frames and partial observations. Architecturally, a time-distributed geometric encoder extracts per-scan features and a sequential aggregator models the evolving vortex state across variable-length sequences. We evaluate on a real-world dataset of over one million LiDAR scans. X-VORTEX achieves superior vortex center localization while using only 1% of the labeled data required by supervised baselines, and the learned representations support accurate trajectory forecasting.</p></details> |  |

We observe that many state-of-the-art open-source web agents rely on long tool-call trajectories with cyclic reasoning loops and exploration of unproductive branches. To address this, we propose WebClipper, a framework that compresses web agent trajectories via graph-based pruning. Concretely, we model the agent's search process as a state graph and cast trajectory optimization as a minimum-necessary Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) mining problem, yielding pruned trajectories that preserve essential reasoning while eliminating redundant steps. Continued training on these refined trajectories enables the agent to evolve toward more efficient search patterns and reduces tool-call rounds by about 20% while improving accuracy. Furthermore, we introduce a new metric called F-AE Score to measure the model's overall performance in balancing accuracy and efficiency. Experiments demonstrate that WebClipper compresses tool-call rounds under excellent performance, providing practical insight into balancing effectiveness and efficiency in web agent design.</p></details> | Work in Progress |
| **[SafeFlowMPC: Predictive and Safe Trajectory Planning for Robot Manipulators with Learning-based Policies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12794v1)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The emerging integration of robots into everyday life brings several major challenges. Compared to classical industrial applications, more flexibility is needed in combination with real-time reactivity. Learning-based methods can train powerful policies based on demonstrated trajectories, such that the robot generalizes a task to similar situations. However, these black-box models lack interpretability and rigorous safety guarantees. Optimization-based methods provide these guarantees but lack the required flexibility and generalization capabilities. This work proposes SafeFlowMPC, a combination of flow matching and online optimization to combine the strengths of learning and optimization. This method guarantees safety at all times and is designed to meet the demands of real-time execution by using a suboptimal model-predictive control formulation. SafeFlowMPC achieves strong performance in three real-world experiments on a KUKA 7-DoF manipulator, namely two grasping experiment and a dynamic human-robot object handover experiment.

| **[T3D: Few-Step Diffusion Language Models via Trajectory Self-Distillation with Direct Discriminative Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12262v2)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion large language models (DLLMs) have the potential to enable fast text generation by decoding multiple tokens in parallel. However, in practice, their inference efficiency is constrained by the need for many refinement steps, while aggressively reducing the number of steps leads to a substantial degradation in generation quality. To alleviate this, we propose a trajectory self-distillation framework that improves few-step decoding by distilling the model's own generative trajectories. We incorporate Direct Discriminative Optimization (DDO), a reverse-KL objective that promotes mode-seeking distillation and encourages the student to concentrate on high-probability teacher modes. Across benchmarks, our approach consistently outperforms strong few-step baselines and standard training under tight step budgets. Although full-step decoding remains superior, we substantially narrow the gap, establishing a strong foundation towards practical few-step DLLMs. The source code is available at https://github.com/Tyrion58/T3D.</p></details> |  |
| **[Which Reasoning Trajectories Teach Students to Reason Better? A Simple Metric of Informative Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14249v3)** | 2026-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Long chain-of-thought (CoT) trajectories provide rich supervision signals for distilling reasoning from teacher to student LLMs. However, both prior work and our experiments show that trajectories from stronger teachers do not necessarily yield better students, highlighting the importance of data-student suitability in distillation. Existing methods assess suitability primarily through student likelihood, favoring trajectories that align closely with the student model's current behavior but overlooking more informative ones. Addressing this, we propose Rank-Surprisal Ratio (RSR), a simple metric that captures both alignment and informativeness to assess the suitability of a reasoning trajectory. RSR is motivated by the observation that effective trajectories typically balance learning signal strength and behavioral alignment by combining low absolute probability with relatively high-ranked tokens under the student model. Concretely, RSR is defined as the ratio of a trajectory's average token-wise rank to its average negative log-likelihood, and is straightforward to compute and interpret. Across five student models and reasoning trajectories from 11 diverse teachers, RSR strongly correlates with post-training reasoning performance (average Spearman 0.86), consistently outperforming existing metrics. We further demonstrate its practical utility in both trajectory selection and teacher selection.</p></details> | <details><summary>29 pa...</summary><p>29 pages.

This paper presents CORTEX (Convex Optimization for Rendezvous Trajectory Execution), an autonomous, perception-enabled, real-time trajectory design and guidance framework for close-range rendezvous. CORTEX integrates a deep-learning perception pipeline with convex-optimisation-based trajectory design and guidance, including reference regeneration and abort-to-safe-orbit logic to recover from large deviations caused by sensor faults and engine failures. CORTEX is validated in high-fidelity software simulation and hardware-in-the-loop experiments. The software pipeline (Basilisk) models high-fidelity relative dynamics, realistic thruster execution, perception, and attitude control. Hardware testing uses (i) an optical navigation testbed to assess perception-to-estimation performance and (ii) a planar air-bearing testbed to evaluate the end-to-end guidance loop under representative actuation and subsystem effects. A Monte-Carlo campaign in simulation includes initial-state uncertainty, thrust-magnitude errors, and missed-thrust events; under the strongest case investigated, CORTEX achieves terminal docking errors of $36.85 \pm 44.46$ mm in relative position and $1.25 \pm 2.26$ mm/s in relative velocity. On the planar air-bearing testbed, 18 cases are executed (10 nominal; 8 off-nominal requiring recomputation and/or abort due to simulated engine failure and sensor malfunctions), yielding terminal errors of $8.09 \pm 5.29$ mm in position and $2.23 \pm 1.72$ mm/s in velocity.</p></details> |  |
| **[PathCRF: Ball-Free Soccer Event Detection via Possession Path Inference from Player Trajectories](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12080v1)** | 2026-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite recent advances in AI, event data collection in soccer still relies heavily on labor-intensive manual annotation. Although prior work has explored automatic event detection using player and ball trajectories, ball tracking also remains difficult to scale due to high infrastructural and operational costs. As a result, comprehensive data collection in soccer is largely confined to top-tier competitions, limiting the broader adoption of data-driven analysis in this domain. To address this challenge, this paper proposes PathCRF, a framework for detecting on-ball soccer events using only player tracking data. We model player trajectories as a fully connected dynamic graph and formulate event detection as the problem of selecting exactly one edge corresponding to the current possession state at each time step. To ensure logical consistency of the resulting edge sequence, we employ a Conditional Random Field (CRF) that forbids impossible transitions between consecutive edges. Both emission and transition scores dynamically computed from edge embeddings produced by a Set Attention-based backbone architecture. During inference, the most probable edge sequence is obtained via Viterbi decoding, and events such as ball controls or passes are detected whenever the selected edge changes between adjacent time steps. Experiments show that PathCRF produces accurate, logically consistent possession paths, enabling reliable downstream analyses while substantially reducing the need for manual event annotation. The source code is available at https://github.com/hyunsungkim-ds/pathcrf.git.</p></details> |  |
| **[Data-Driven Trajectory Imputation for Vessel Mobility Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11890v1)** | 2026-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modeling vessel activity at sea is critical for a wide range of applications, including route planning, transportation logistics, maritime safety, and environmental monitoring. Over the past two decades, the Automatic Identification System (AIS) has enabled real-time monitoring of hundreds of thousands of vessels, generating huge amounts of data daily. One major challenge in using AIS data is the presence of large gaps in vessel trajectories, often caused by coverage limitations or intentional transmission interruptions. These gaps can significantly degrade data quality, resulting in inaccurate or incomplete analysis. State-of-the-art imputation approaches have mainly been devised to tackle gaps in vehicle trajectories, even when the underlying road network is not considered. But the motion patterns of sailing vessels differ substantially, e.g., smooth turns, maneuvering near ports, or navigating in adverse weather conditions. In this application paper, we propose HABIT, a lightweight, configurable H3 Aggregation-Based Imputation framework for vessel Trajectories. This data-driven framework provides a valuable means to impute missing trajectory segments by extracting, analyzing, and indexing motion patterns from historical AIS data. Our empirical study over AIS data across various timeframes, densities, and vessel types reveals that HABIT produces maritime trajectory imputations performing comparably to baseline methods in terms of accuracy, while performing better in terms of latency while accounting for vessel characteristics and their motion patterns.</p></details> | <details><summary>Inter...</summary><p>International Conference on Extending Database Technology (EDBT 2026)</p></details> |
| **[TSR: Trajectory-Search Rollouts for Multi-Turn RL of LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11767v1)** | 2026-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advances in large language models (LLMs) are driving a shift toward using reinforcement learning (RL) to train agents from iterative, multi-turn interactions across tasks. However, multi-turn RL remains challenging as rewards are often sparse or delayed, and environments can be stochastic. In this regime, naive trajectory sampling can hinder exploitation and induce mode collapse. We propose TSR (Trajectory-Search Rollouts), a training-time approach that repurposes test-time scaling ideas for improved per-turn rollout generation. TSR performs lightweight tree-style search to construct high-quality trajectories by selecting high-scoring actions at each turn using task-specific feedback. This improves rollout quality and stabilizes learning while leaving the underlying optimization objective unchanged, making TSR optimizer-agnostic. We instantiate TSR with best-of-N, beam, and shallow lookahead search, and pair it with PPO and GRPO, achieving up to 15% performance gains and more stable learning on Sokoban, FrozenLake, and WebShop tasks at a one-time increase in training compute. By moving search from inference time to the rollout stage of training, TSR provides a simple and general mechanism for stronger multi-turn agent learning, complementary to existing frameworks and rejection-sampling-style selection methods.</p></details> |  |

However, attempts to further improve LoopLM reasoning with reinforcement learning have failed - standard objectives such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) only assign credit to the final latent state, creating a fundamental mismatch with the model's internal computation. To resolve this, we introduce RLTT (Reward Latent Thought Trajectories), a reinforcement learning framework which distributes reward across the full latent reasoning trajectory. RLTT provides dense, trajectory-level credit assignment without relying on external verifiers and can directly replace GRPO with negligible overhead. Across extensive experiments with Ouro-2.6B-Thinking under identical training and inference conditions, RLTT yields substantial improvements over GRPO on challenging mathematical reasoning benchmarks, improving accuracy by +14.4% on MATH-500, +16.6% on AIME24, and +10.0% on BeyondAIME. Despite being trained exclusively on mathematics, RLTT also transfers effectively to non-mathematical reasoning benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of trajectory-level credit assignment for reinforcement learning in LoopLMs.</p></details> |  |

Existing approaches largely rely on human teleoperation with wearable devices or specialized sensing equipment to capture hand-object interactions, which limits scalability. In this work, we propose VIDEOMANIP, a device-free framework that learns dexterous manipulation directly from RGB human videos. Leveraging recent advances in computer vision, VIDEOMANIP reconstructs explicit 3D robot-object trajectories from monocular videos by estimating human hand poses, object meshes, and retargets the reconstructed human motions to robotic hands for manipulation learning. To make the reconstructed robot data suitable for dexterous manipulation training, we introduce hand-object contact optimization with interaction-centric grasp modeling, as well as a demonstration synthesis strategy that generates diverse training trajectories from a single video, enabling generalizable policy learning without additional robot demonstrations. In simulation, the learned grasping model achieves a 70.25% success rate across 20 diverse objects using the Inspire Hand. In the real world, manipulation policies trained from RGB videos achieve an average 62.86% success rate across seven tasks using the LEAP Hand, outperforming retargeting-based methods by 15.87%.

| **[TRACER: Trajectory Risk Aggregation for Critical Episodes in Agentic Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11409v1)** | 2026-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Estimating uncertainty for AI agents in real-world multi-turn tool-using interaction with humans is difficult because failures are often triggered by sparse critical episodes (e.g., looping, incoherent tool use, or user-agent miscoordination) even when local generation appears confident. Existing uncertainty proxies focus on single-shot text generation and therefore miss these trajectory-level breakdown signals. We introduce TRACER, a trajectory-level uncertainty metric for dual-control Tool-Agent-User interaction. TRACER combines content-aware surprisal with situational-awareness signals, semantic and lexical repetition, and tool-grounded coherence gaps, and aggregates them using a tail-focused risk functional with a MAX-composite step risk to surface decisive anomalies. We evaluate TRACER on $τ^2$-bench by predicting task failure and selective task execution. To this end, TRACER improves AUROC by up to 37.1% and AUARC by up to 55% over baselines, enabling earlier and more accurate detection of uncertainty in complex conversational tool-use settings.

They discard information during image encoding, require a separately trained decoder, and model an auxiliary distribution to the raw data. In this paper, we propose Latent Forcing, a simple modification to existing architectures that achieves the efficiency of latent diffusion while operating on raw natural images. Our approach orders the denoising trajectory by jointly processing latents and pixels with separately tuned noise schedules. This allows the latents to act as a scratchpad for intermediate computation before high-frequency pixel features are generated. We find that the order of conditioning signals is critical, and we analyze this to explain differences between REPA distillation in the tokenizer and the diffusion model, conditional versus unconditional generation, and how tokenizer reconstruction quality relates to diffusability. Applied to ImageNet, Latent Forcing achieves a new state-of-the-art for diffusion transformer-based pixel generation at our compute scale.</p></details> | 8 pages, 6 figures |

UAVs equipped with gimballed electro-optical sensors are typically used to localize targets, however, reliance on these sensors increases mechanical complexity, cost, and susceptibility to single-point failures, limiting scalability and robustness in multi-UAV operations. This work presents a new trajectory optimization framework that enables cooperative target localization using UAVs with fixed, non-gimballed cameras operating in coordination with a surface vessel. This estimation-aware optimization generates dynamically feasible trajectories that explicitly account for mission constraints, platform dynamics, and out-of-frame events. Estimation-aware trajectories outperform heuristic paths by reducing localization error by more than a factor of two, motivating their use in cooperative operations. Results further demonstrate that coordinated UAVs with fixed, non-gimballed cameras achieve localization accuracy that meets or exceeds that of single gimballed systems, while substantially lowering system complexity and cost, enabling scalability, and enhancing mission resilience.</p></details> | <details><summary>38 pa...</summary><p>38 pages, 7 figure, and 6 tables</p></details> |

In many real-world domains, online learning in the environment can be risky, and specifying accurate safety costs can be difficult. However, it is often feasible to collect trajectories that reflect undesirable or unsafe behavior, implicitly conveying what the agent should avoid. We refer to these as non-preferred trajectories. We propose a novel offline safe IL algorithm, OSIL, that infers safety from non-preferred demonstrations. We formulate safe policy learning as a Constrained Markov Decision Process (CMDP). Instead of relying on explicit safety cost and reward annotations, OSIL reformulates the CMDP problem by deriving a lower bound on reward maximizing objective and learning a cost model that estimates the likelihood of non-preferred behavior. Our approach allows agents to learn safe and reward-maximizing behavior entirely from offline demonstrations. We empirically demonstrate that our approach can learn safer policies that satisfy cost constraints without degrading the reward performance, thus outperforming several baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, Accepted at AAMAS 2026</p></details> |

While prior work has focused on accuracy, social interaction modeling, and diversity, little attention has been paid to uncertainty modeling, calibration, and forecasts from short observation periods, which are crucial for downstream tasks such as path planning and collision avoidance. We propose DD-MDN, an end-to-end probabilistic HTF model that combines high positional accuracy, calibrated uncertainty, and robustness to short observations. Using a few-shot denoising diffusion backbone and a dual mixture density network, our method learns self-calibrated residence areas and probability-ranked anchor paths, from which diverse trajectory hypotheses are derived, without predefined anchors or endpoints. Experiments on the ETH/UCY, SDD, inD, and IMPTC datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art accuracy, robustness at short observation intervals, and reliable uncertainty modeling.

| **[Self-Augmented Robot Trajectory: Efficient Imitation Learning via Safe Self-augmentation with Demonstrator-annotated Precision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09893v2)** | 2026-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Imitation learning is a promising paradigm for training robot agents; however, standard approaches typically require substantial data acquisition -- via numerous demonstrations or random exploration -- to ensure reliable performance. Although exploration reduces human effort, it lacks safety guarantees and often results in frequent collisions -- particularly in clearance-limited tasks (e.g., peg-in-hole) -- thereby, necessitating manual environmental resets and imposing additional human burden. This study proposes Self-Augmented Robot Trajectory (SART), a framework that enables policy learning from a single human demonstration, while safely expanding the dataset through autonomous augmentation. SART consists of two stages: (1) human teaching only once, where a single demonstration is provided and precision boundaries -- represented as spheres around key waypoints -- are annotated, followed by one environment reset; (2) robot self-augmentation, where the robot generates diverse, collision-free trajectories within these boundaries and reconnects to the original demonstration. This design improves the data collection efficiency by minimizing human effort while ensuring safety.

| **[Learning Structure-Semantic Evolution Trajectories for Graph Domain Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10506v1)** | 2026-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Domain Adaptation (GDA) aims to bridge distribution shifts between domains by transferring knowledge from well-labeled source graphs to given unlabeled target graphs. One promising recent approach addresses graph transfer by discretizing the adaptation process, typically through the construction of intermediate graphs or stepwise alignment procedures. However, such discrete strategies often fail in real-world scenarios, where graph structures evolve continuously and nonlinearly, making it difficult for fixed-step alignment to approximate the actual transformation process. To address these limitations, we propose \textbf{DiffGDA}, a \textbf{Diff}usion-based \textbf{GDA} method that models the domain adaptation process as a continuous-time generative process. We formulate the evolution from source to target graphs using stochastic differential equations (SDEs), enabling the joint modeling of structural and semantic transitions. To guide this evolution, a domain-aware network is introduced to steer the generative process toward the target domain, encouraging the diffusion trajectory to follow an optimal adaptation path. We theoretically show that the diffusion process converges to the optimal solution bridging the source and target domains in the latent space. Extensive experiments on 14 graph transfer tasks across 8 real-world datasets demonstrate DiffGDA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by ICLR 2026, 21 pages</p></details> |
| **[Driving Reaction Trajectories via Latent Flow Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10476v1)** | 2026-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in reaction prediction have achieved near-saturated accuracy on standard benchmarks (e.g., USPTO), yet most state-of-the-art models formulate the task as a one-shot mapping from reactants to products, offering limited insight into the underlying reaction process. Procedural alternatives introduce stepwise generation but often rely on mechanism-specific supervision, discrete symbolic edits, and computationally expensive inference. In this work, we propose LatentRxnFlow, a new reaction prediction paradigm that models reactions as continuous latent trajectories anchored at the thermodynamic product state. Built on Conditional Flow Matching, our approach learns time-dependent latent dynamics directly from standard reactant-product pairs, without requiring mechanistic annotations or curated intermediate labels. While LatentRxnFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance on USPTO benchmarks, more importantly, the continuous formulation exposes the full generative trajectory, enabling trajectory-level diagnostics that are difficult to realize with discrete or one-shot models. We show that latent trajectory analysis allows us to localize and characterize failure modes and to mitigate certain errors via gated inference. Furthermore, geometric properties of the learned trajectories provide an intrinsic signal of epistemic uncertainty, helping prioritize reliably predictable reaction outcomes and flag ambiguous cases for additional validation. Overall, LatentRxnFlow combines strong predictive accuracy with improved transparency, diagnosability, and uncertainty awareness, moving reaction prediction toward more trustworthy deployment in high-throughput discovery workflows.</p></details> |  |
| **[TABES: Trajectory-Aware Backward-on-Entropy Steering for Masked Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00250v2)** | 2026-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Masked Diffusion Models (MDMs) have emerged as a promising non-autoregressive paradigm for generative tasks, offering parallel decoding and bidirectional context utilization. However, current sampling methods rely on simple confidence-based heuristics that ignore the long-term impact of local decisions, leading to trajectory lock-in where early hallucinations cascade into global incoherence. While search-based methods mitigate this, they incur prohibitive computational costs ($O(K)$ forward passes per step). In this work, we propose Backward-on-Entropy (BoE) Steering, a gradient-guided inference framework that approximates infinite-horizon lookahead via a single backward pass. We formally derive the Token Influence Score (TIS) from a first-order expansion of the trajectory cost functional, proving that the gradient of future entropy with respect to input embeddings serves as an optimal control signal for minimizing uncertainty. To ensure scalability, we introduce \texttt{ActiveQueryAttention}, a sparse adjoint primitive that exploits the structure of the masking objective to reduce backward pass complexity. BoE achieves a superior Pareto frontier for inference-time scaling compared to existing unmasking methods, demonstrating that gradient-guided steering offers a mathematically principled and efficient path to robust non-autoregressive generation. We will release the code.</p></details> |  |
| **[Solving Geodesic Equations with Composite Bernstein Polynomials for Trajectory Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10365v1)** | 2026-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work presents a trajectory planning method based on composite Bernstein polynomials for autonomous systems navigating complex environments. The method is implemented in a symbolic optimization framework that enables continuous paths and precise control over trajectory shape. Trajectories are planned over a cost surface that encodes obstacles as continuous fields rather than discrete boundaries. Regions near obstacles are assigned higher costs, naturally encouraging the trajectory to maintain a safe distance while still allowing efficient routing through constrained spaces. The use of composite Bernstein polynomials preserves continuity while enabling fine control over local curvature to satisfy geodesic constraints. The symbolic representation supports exact derivatives, improving optimization efficiency. The method applies to both two- and three-dimensional environments and is suitable for ground, aerial, underwater, and space systems. In spacecraft trajectory planning, for example, it enables the generation of continuous, dynamically feasible trajectories with high numerical efficiency, making it well suited for orbital maneuvers, rendezvous and proximity operations, cluttered gravitational environments, and planetary exploration missions with limited onboard computational resources. Demonstrations show that the approach efficiently generates smooth, collision-free paths in scenarios with multiple obstacles, maintaining clearance without extensive sampling or post-processing. The optimization incorporates three constraint types: (1) a Gaussian surface inequality enforcing minimum obstacle clearance; (2) geodesic equations guiding the path along locally efficient directions on the cost surface; and (3) boundary constraints enforcing fixed start and end conditions. The method can serve as a standalone planner or as an initializer for more complex motion planning problems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for the 2026 IEEE Aerospace Conference</p></details> |
| **[Optimal Control of Microswimmers for Trajectory Tracking Using Bayesian Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09563v1)** | 2026-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory tracking for microswimmers remains a key challenge in microrobotics, where low-Reynolds-number dynamics make control design particularly complex. In this work, we formulate the trajectory tracking problem as an optimal control problem and solve it using a combination of B-spline parametrization with Bayesian optimization, allowing the treatment of high computational costs without requiring complex gradient computations. Applied to a flagellated magnetic swimmer, the proposed method reproduces a variety of target trajectories, including biologically inspired paths observed in experimental studies. We further evaluate the approach on a three-sphere swimmer model, demonstrating that it can adapt to and partially compensate for wall-induced hydrodynamic effects. The proposed optimization strategy can be applied consistently across models of different fidelity, from low-dimensional ODE-based models to high-fidelity PDE-based simulations, showing its robustness and generality. These results highlight the potential of Bayesian optimization as a versatile tool for optimal control strategies in microscale locomotion under complex fluid-structure interactions.</p></details> | 16 pages, 16 figures |
| **[Look-Ahead and Look-Back Flows: Training-Free Image Generation with Trajectory Smoothing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09449v1)** | 2026-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances have reformulated diffusion models as deterministic ordinary differential equations (ODEs) through the framework of flow matching, providing a unified formulation for the noise-to-data generative process. Various training-free flow matching approaches have been developed to improve image generation through flow velocity field adjustment, eliminating the need for costly retraining. However, Modifying the velocity field $v$ introduces errors that propagate through the full generation path, whereas adjustments to the latent trajectory $z$ are naturally corrected by the pretrained velocity network, reducing error accumulation. In this paper, we propose two complementary training-free latent-trajectory adjustment approaches based on future and past velocity $v$ and latent trajectory $z$ information that refine the generative path directly in latent space. We propose two training-free trajectory smoothing schemes: \emph{Look-Ahead}, which averages the current and next-step latents using a curvature-gated weight, and \emph{Look-Back}, which smoothes latents using an exponential moving average with decay. We demonstrate through extensive experiments and comprehensive evaluation metrics that the proposed training-free trajectory smoothing models substantially outperform various state-of-the-art models across multiple datasets including COCO17, CUB-200, and Flickr30K.</p></details> |  |

However, progress in this field is hindered by two key challenges: the over-reliance on older datasets from 2012-2013 and the lack of reproducible, city-level check-in datasets that reflect diverse global regions. To address these gaps, we present Massive-STEPS (Massive Semantic Trajectories for Understanding POI Check-ins), a large-scale, publicly available benchmark dataset built upon the Semantic Trails dataset and enriched with semantic POI metadata. Massive-STEPS spans 15 geographically and culturally diverse cities and features more recent (2017-2018) and longer-duration (24 months) check-in data than prior datasets. We benchmarked a wide range of POI models on Massive-STEPS using both supervised and zero-shot approaches, and evaluated their performance across multiple urban contexts. By releasing Massive-STEPS, we aim to facilitate reproducible and equitable research in human mobility and POI trajectory modeling. The dataset and benchmarking code are available at: https://github.com/cruiseresearchgroup/Massive-STEPS.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Legible to Inscrutable Trajectories: (Il)legible Motion Planning Accounting for Multiple Observers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09227v1)** | 2026-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In cooperative environments, such as in factories or assistive scenarios, it is important for a robot to communicate its intentions to observers, who could be either other humans or robots. A legible trajectory allows an observer to quickly and accurately predict an agent's intention. In adversarial environments, such as in military operations or games, it is important for a robot to not communicate its intentions to observers. An illegible trajectory leads an observer to incorrectly predict the agent's intention or delays when an observer is able to make a correct prediction about the agent's intention. However, in some environments there are multiple observers, each of whom may be able to see only part of the environment, and each of whom may have different motives. In this work, we introduce the Mixed-Motive Limited-Observability Legible Motion Planning (MMLO-LMP) problem, which requires a motion planner to generate a trajectory that is legible to observers with positive motives and illegible to observers with negative motives while also considering the visibility limitations of each observer. We highlight multiple strategies an agent can take while still achieving the problem objective. We also present DUBIOUS, a trajectory optimizer that solves MMLO-LMP. Our results show that DUBIOUS can generate trajectories that balance legibility with the motives and limited visibility regions of the observers. Future work includes many variations of MMLO-LMP, including moving observers and observer teaming.</p></details> | 17 pages, 5 figures |

While most existing approaches treat human as point mass, we present a study on multi-agent trajectory prediction that leverages different human skeletal features for improved forecast accuracy. In particular, we systematically evaluate the predictive utility of 2D and 3D skeletal keypoints and derived biomechanical cues as additional inputs. Through a comprehensive study on the JRDB dataset and another new dataset for social navigation with 360-degree panoramic videos, we find that focusing on lower-body 3D keypoints yields a 13% reduction in Average Displacement Error and augmenting 3D keypoint inputs with corresponding biomechanical cues provides a further 1-4% improvement. Notably, the performance gain persists when using 2D keypoint inputs extracted from equirectangular panoramic images, indicating that monocular surround vision can capture informative cues for motion forecasting. Our finding that robots can forecast human movement efficiently by watching their legs provides actionable insights for designing sensing capabilities for social robot navigation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE ICRA 2026</p></details> |
| **[Beyond Quantity: Trajectory Diversity Scaling for Code Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03219v2)** | 2026-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As code large language models (LLMs) evolve into tool-interactive agents via the Model Context Protocol (MCP), their generalization is increasingly limited by low-quality synthetic data and the diminishing returns of quantity scaling. Moreover, quantity-centric scaling exhibits an early bottleneck that underutilizes trajectory data. We propose TDScaling, a Trajectory Diversity Scaling-based data synthesis framework for code agents that scales performance through diversity rather than raw volume. Under a fixed training budget, increasing trajectory diversity yields larger gains than adding more trajectories, improving the performance-cost trade-off for agent training. TDScaling integrates four innovations: (1) a Business Cluster mechanism that captures real-service logical dependencies; (2) a blueprint-driven multi-agent paradigm that enforces trajectory coherence; (3) an adaptive evolution mechanism that steers synthesis toward long-tail scenarios using Domain Entropy, Reasoning Mode Entropy, and Cumulative Action Complexity to prevent mode collapse; and (4) a sandboxed code tool that mitigates catastrophic forgetting of intrinsic coding capabilities. Experiments on general tool-use benchmarks (BFCL, tau^2-Bench) and code agent tasks (RebenchT, CodeCI, BIRD) demonstrate a win-win outcome: TDScaling improves both tool-use generalization and inherent coding proficiency. We plan to release the full codebase and the synthesized dataset (including 30,000+ tool clusters) upon publication.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mimic Intent, Not Just Trajectories](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08602v1)** | 2026-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While imitation learning (IL) has achieved impressive success in dexterous manipulation through generative modeling and pretraining, state-of-the-art approaches like Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models still struggle with adaptation to environmental changes and skill transfer. We argue this stems from mimicking raw trajectories without understanding the underlying intent. To address this, we propose explicitly disentangling behavior intent from execution details in end-2-end IL: \textit{``Mimic Intent, Not just Trajectories'' (MINT)}. We achieve this via \textit{multi-scale frequency-space tokenization}, which enforces a spectral decomposition of action chunk representation. We learn action tokens with a multi-scale coarse-to-fine structure, and force the coarsest token to capture low-frequency global structure and finer tokens to encode high-frequency details. This yields an abstract \textit{Intent token} that facilitates planning and transfer, and multi-scale \textit{Execution tokens} that enable precise adaptation to environmental dynamics. Building on this hierarchy, our policy generates trajectories through \textit{next-scale autoregression}, performing progressive \textit{intent-to-execution reasoning}, thus boosting learning efficiency and generalization. Crucially, this disentanglement enables \textit{one-shot transfer} of skills, by simply injecting the Intent token from a demonstration into the autoregressive generation process. Experiments on several manipulation benchmarks and on a real robot demonstrate state-of-the-art success rates, superior inference efficiency, robust generalization against disturbances, and effective one-shot transfer.</p></details> | Under review |
| **[Trajectory Stitching for Solving Inverse Problems with Flow-Based Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08538v1)** | 2026-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Flow-based generative models have emerged as powerful priors for solving inverse problems. One option is to directly optimize the initial latent code (noise), such that the flow output solves the inverse problem. However, this requires backpropagating through the entire generative trajectory, incurring high memory costs and numerical instability. We propose MS-Flow, which represents the trajectory as a sequence of intermediate latent states rather than a single initial code. By enforcing the flow dynamics locally and coupling segments through trajectory-matching penalties, MS-Flow alternates between updating intermediate latent states and enforcing consistency with observed data. This reduces memory consumption while improving reconstruction quality. We demonstrate the effectiveness of MS-Flow over existing methods on image recovery and inverse problems, including inpainting, super-resolution, and computed tomography.</p></details> |  |

As part of the demo, participants can configure parameters to automatically download and process AIS data, observe how trajectories are completed and annotated, inspect both raw and imputed segments together with their SD-KG evidence, and interactively explore the SD-KG through a dedicated graph viewer, gaining an intuitive and transparent understanding of vessel movements.</p></details> | <details><summary>4 pag...</summary><p>4 pages, and 5 Figures</p></details> |

This paper investigates the generation of human-like trajectories using a receding horizon approach applied to the TickTacking interface in a target-tracking task. By analyzing user-generated trajectories, we identify key human behavioral features and incorporate them in a controller that mimics these behaviors. The performance of this human-inspired controller is evaluated against a baseline optimal-control-based agent, demonstrating the importance of specific control features for achieving human-like interaction. These findings contribute to the broader goal of developing rhythm-based human-machine interfaces by offering design insights that enhance user performance, improve intuitiveness, and reduce interaction frustration</p></details> |  |

This paper proposes a structured heuristic recovery control law that jointly commands steering and tractive force for a generalized single-track Ackermann vehicle model. The formulation explicitly accounts for time-varying longitudinal velocity in the lateral-yaw dynamics and retains nonlinear steering-coupled interaction terms that are commonly simplified in the literature. Unlike approaches that assume constant longitudinal speed, the proposed design targets the transient post-impact regime where speed variations and nonlinear coupling significantly influence recovery. The method is evaluated in simulation on the proposed generalized single-track model and a standard 3DOF single-track reference model in MATLAB, demonstrating consistent post-collision restoration behaviour across representative initial post-impact conditions.</p></details> | 10 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Is Flow Matching Just Trajectory Replay for Sequential Data?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08318v1)** | 2026-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Flow matching (FM) is increasingly used for time-series generation, but it is not well understood whether it learns a general dynamical structure or simply performs an effective "trajectory replay". We study this question by deriving the velocity field targeted by the empirical FM objective on sequential data, in the limit of perfect function approximation. For the Gaussian conditional paths commonly used in practice, we show that the implied sampler is an ODE whose dynamics constitutes a nonparametric, memory-augmented continuous-time dynamical system. The optimal field admits a closed-form expression as a similarity-weighted mixture of instantaneous velocities induced by past transitions, making the dataset dependence explicit and interpretable. This perspective positions neural FM models trained by stochastic optimization as parametric surrogates of an ideal nonparametric solution. Using the structure of the optimal field, we study sampling and approximation schemes that improve the efficiency and numerical robustness of ODE-based generation. On nonlinear dynamical system benchmarks, the resulting closed-form sampler yields strong probabilistic forecasts directly from historical transitions, without training.</p></details> | 51 pages |

The optimization performance largely depends on the quality of initial trajectories. However, the selection of a high-quality initial trajectory is non-trivial and requires a considerable time budget due to the extremely large space of the solution trajectories and the lack of prior knowledge about task constraints in configuration space. To alleviate the issue, we present a learning-based initial trajectory generation method that generates high-quality initial trajectories in a short time budget by adopting example-guided reinforcement learning. In addition, we suggest a null-space projected imitation reward to consider null-space constraints by efficiently learning kinematically feasible motion captured in expert demonstrations. Our statistical evaluation in simulation shows the improved optimality, efficiency, and applicability of TO when we plug in our method's output, compared with three other baselines. We also show the performance improvement and feasibility via real-world experiments with a seven-degree-of-freedom manipulator.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICRA 2023.

However, the high collection costs and ever-increasing privacy concerns prevent us from accessing large-scale LBSN trajectory data. The recent advances in synthetic data generation provide us with a new opportunity to achieve this, which utilizes generative AI to generate synthetic data that preserves the characteristics of real data while ensuring privacy protection. However, generating synthetic LBSN check-in trajectories remains challenging due to their spatially discrete, temporally irregular nature and the complex spatio-temporal patterns caused by sparse activities and uncertain human mobility. To address this challenge, we propose GeoGen, a two-stage coarse-to-fine framework for large-scale LBSN check-in trajectory generation. In the first stage, we reconstruct spatially continuous, temporally regular latent movement sequences from the original LBSN check-in trajectories and then design a Sparsity-aware Spatio-temporal Diffusion model (S$^2$TDiff) with an efficient denosing network to learn their underlying behavioral patterns. In the second stage, we design Coarse2FineNet, a Transformer-based Seq2Seq architecture equipped with a dynamic context fusion mechanism in the encoder and a multi-task hybrid-head decoder, which generates fine-grained LBSN trajectories based on coarse-grained latent movement sequences by modeling semantic relevance and behavioral uncertainty. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets show that GeoGen excels state-of-the-art models for both fidelity and utility evaluation, e.g., it increases over 69% and 55% in distance and radius metrics on the FS-TKY dataset.</p></details> |  |
| **[R-Stitch: Dynamic Trajectory Stitching for Efficient Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17307v6)** | 2026-02-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Chain-of-thought (CoT) enhances the problem-solving ability of large language models (LLMs) but incurs substantial inference cost due to long autoregressive trajectories. Existing acceleration strategies either shorten traces via early stopping or compression, or adopt speculative decoding with a smaller model. However, speculative decoding provides limited gains when model agreement is low and rigidly enforces token-level consistency, overlooking the observation that some smaller models, when correct, produce significantly more concise reasoning traces that could reduce inference length. We introduce R-Stitch, a training-free hybrid decoding framework that leverages token-level entropy as an uncertainty proxy to delegate computation between a small language model (SLM) and an LLM. Our analysis shows that high-entropy tokens are more likely to induce errors, motivating an entropy-guided routing strategy that lets the SLM efficiently handle low-entropy tokens while delegating uncertain ones to the LLM, thereby avoiding full rollbacks and preserving answer quality. We further extend this design with R-Stitch$^{+}$, which learns an adaptive routing policy to adjust the token budget dynamically beyond fixed thresholds. By jointly reducing per-token decoding complexity and the number of generated tokens, our method achieves substantial acceleration with negligible accuracy loss. Concretely, it attains peak speedups of 3.00$\times$ on DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B, 3.85$\times$ on 14B, and 4.10$\times$ on QWQ-32B while maintaining accuracy comparable to full LLM decoding. Moreover, it naturally enables adaptive efficiency--accuracy trade-offs that can be tailored to diverse computational budgets without retraining.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trajectory-Aware Multi-RIS Activation and Configuration: A Riemannian Diffusion Method](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07937v1)** | 2026-02-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) offer a low-cost, energy-efficient means for enhancing wireless coverage. Yet, their inherently programmable reflections may unintentionally amplify interference, particularly in large-scale, multi-RIS-enabled mobile communication scenarios where dense user mobility and frequent line-of-sight overlaps can severely degrade the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR). To address this challenge, this paper presents a novel generative multi-RIS control framework that jointly optimizes the ON/OFF activation patterns of multiple RISs in the smart wireless environment and the phase configurations of the activated RISs based on predictions of multi-user trajectories and interference patterns. We specially design a long short-term memory (LSTM) artificial neural network, enriched with speed and heading features, to forecast multi-user trajectories, thereby enabling reconstruction of future channel state information. To overcome the highly nonconvex nature of the multi-RIS control problem, we develop a Riemannian diffusion model on the torus to generate geometry-consistent phase-configuration, where the reverse diffusion process is dynamically guided by reinforcement learning. We then rigorously derive the optimal ON/OFF states of the metasurfaces by comparing predicted achievable rates under RIS activation and deactivation conditions. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves up to 30\% SINR improvement over learning-based control and up to 44\% gain compared with the RIS always-on scheme, while consistently outperforming state-of-the-art baselines across different transmit powers, RIS configurations, and interference densities.</p></details> |  |

Our approach leverages a 4-dimensional spatio-temporal planner, integrated with vision-based Safe Flight Corridor (SFC) generation and trajectory optimization. Unlike prior methods that rely on map fusion, our framework is mapless, enabling collision avoidance directly from perception while reducing computational overhead. Dynamic obstacles are detected and tracked using a vision-based object segmentation and tracking pipeline, allowing robust classification of static versus dynamic elements in the scene. To further enhance robustness, we introduce a backup planning module that reactively avoids dynamic obstacles when no direct path to the goal is available, mitigating the risk of collisions during deadlock situations. We validate our method extensively in both simulation and real-world hardware experiments, and benchmark it against state-of-the-art approaches, showing significant advantages for reactive UAV navigation in dynamic, unknown environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at ICRA 2026</p></details> |

To address this, a surge of deep generative models has recently emerged to learn dynamics at coarsened timesteps for efficient trajectory generation, yet they either generalize poorly across systems or, due to limited molecular diversity of trajectory data, fail to fully exploit structural information to improve generative fidelity. Here, we present the Pretrained Variational Bridge (PVB) in an encoder-decoder fashion, which maps the initial structure into a noised latent space and transports it toward stage-specific targets through augmented bridge matching. This unifies training on both single-structure and paired trajectory data, enabling consistent use of cross-domain structural knowledge across training stages. Moreover, for protein-ligand complexes, we further introduce a reinforcement learning-based optimization via adjoint matching that speeds progression toward the holo state, which supports efficient post-optimization of docking poses. Experiments on proteins and protein-ligand complexes demonstrate that PVB faithfully reproduces thermodynamic and kinetic observables from MD while delivering stable and efficient generative dynamics.</p></details> | <details><summary>The F...</summary><p>The Fourteenth International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR 2026)</p></details> |

In this work, we present RAPiD, a deterministic policy extraction framework that distills a pretrained diffusion-based planner into an efficient policy while eliminating diffusion sampling. Using score-regularized policy optimization, we leverage the score function of a pre-trained diffusion planner as a behavior prior to regularize policy learning. To promote safety and passenger comfort, the policy is optimized using a critic trained to imitate a predictive driver controller, providing dense, safety-focused supervision beyond conventional imitation learning.

| **[TermiGen: High-Fidelity Environment and Robust Trajectory Synthesis for Terminal Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07274v1)** | 2026-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Executing complex terminal tasks remains a significant challenge for open-weight LLMs, constrained by two fundamental limitations. First, high-fidelity, executable training environments are scarce: environments synthesized from real-world repositories are not diverse and scalable, while trajectories synthesized by LLMs suffer from hallucinations. Second, standard instruction tuning uses expert trajectories that rarely exhibit simple mistakes common to smaller models. This creates a distributional mismatch, leaving student models ill-equipped to recover from their own runtime failures. To bridge these gaps, we introduce TermiGen, an end-to-end pipeline for synthesizing verifiable environments and resilient expert trajectories. Termi-Gen first generates functionally valid tasks and Docker containers via an iterative multi-agent refinement loop. Subsequently, we employ a Generator-Critic protocol that actively injects errors during trajectory collection, synthesizing data rich in error-correction cycles. Fine-tuned on this TermiGen-generated dataset, our TermiGen-Qwen2.5-Coder-32B achieves a 31.3% pass rate on TerminalBench. This establishes a new open-weights state-of-the-art, outperforming existing baselines and notably surpassing capable proprietary models such as o4-mini.

However, its application to safety-critical physical systems remains constrained by the lack of stability guarantees. Standard RL algorithms prioritize reward maximization, often yielding policies that may induce oscillations or unbounded state divergence. There has been significant work in incorporating Lyapunov-based stability guarantees in RL algorithms with key challenges being selecting a candidate Lyapunov function, computational complexity by using excessive function approximators and conservative policies by incorporating stability criterion in the learning process. In this work we propose a novel Lyapunov-constrained Soft Actor-Critic (LC-SAC) algorithm using Koopman operator theory. We propose use of extended dynamic mode decomposition (EDMD) to produce a linear approximation of the system and use this approximation to derive a closed form solution for candidate Lyapunov function. This derived Lyapunov function is incorporated in the SAC algorithm to further provide guarantees for a policy that stabilizes the nonlinear system. The results are evaluated trajectory tracking of a 2D Quadrotor environment based on safe-control-gym. The proposed algorithm shows training convergence and decaying violations for Lyapunov stability criterion compared to baseline vanilla SAC algorithm.

| **[Accelerating Diffusion Planners in Offline RL via Reward-Aware Consistency Trajectory Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07822v3)** | 2026-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although diffusion models have achieved strong results in decision-making tasks, their slow inference speed remains a key limitation. While consistency models offer a potential solution, existing applications to decision-making either struggle with suboptimal demonstrations under behavior cloning or rely on complex concurrent training of multiple networks under the actor-critic framework. In this work, we propose a novel approach to consistency distillation for offline reinforcement learning that directly incorporates reward optimization into the distillation process. Our method achieves single-step sampling while generating higher-reward action trajectories through decoupled training and noise-free reward signals. Empirical evaluations on the Gym MuJoCo, FrankaKitchen, and long horizon planning benchmarks demonstrate that our approach can achieve a 9.7% improvement over previous state-of-the-art while offering up to 142x speedup over diffusion counterparts in inference time.</p></details> |  |

Conventional formulations typically assume deterministic contact events, which limit robustness and adaptability in real-world settings. In this work, we propose SURE, a robust trajectory optimization framework that explicitly accounts for contact timing uncertainty. By allowing multiple trajectories to branch from possible pre-impact states and later rejoin a shared trajectory, SURE achieves both robustness and computational efficiency within a unified optimization framework. We evaluate SURE on two representative tasks with unknown impact times. In a cart-pole balancing task involving uncertain wall location, SURE achieves an average improvement of 21.6% in success rate when branch switching is enabled during control. In an egg-catching experiment using a robotic manipulator, SURE improves the success rate by 40%. These results demonstrate that SURE substantially enhances robustness compared to conventional nominal formulations.</p></details> |  |

The core component of DynaRetarget is a novel Sampling-Based Trajectory Optimization (SBTO) framework that refines imperfect kinematic trajectories into dynamically feasible motions. SBTO incrementally advances the optimization horizon, enabling optimization over the entire trajectory for long-horizon tasks. We validate DynaRetarget by successfully retargeting hundreds of humanoid-object demonstrations and achieving higher success rates than the state of the art. The framework also generalizes across varying object properties, such as mass, size, and geometry, using the same tracking objective. This ability to robustly retarget diverse demonstrations opens the door to generating large-scale synthetic datasets of humanoid loco-manipulation trajectories, addressing a major bottleneck in real-world data collection.</p></details> |  |
| **[Orientation-Robust Latent Motion Trajectory Learning for Annotation-free Cardiac Phase Detection in Fetal Echocardiography](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06761v1)** | 2026-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fetal echocardiography is essential for detecting congenital heart disease (CHD), facilitating pregnancy management, optimized delivery planning, and timely postnatal interventions. Among standard imaging planes, the four-chamber (4CH) view provides comprehensive information for CHD diagnosis, where clinicians carefully inspect the end-diastolic (ED) and end-systolic (ES) phases to evaluate cardiac structure and motion. Automated detection of these cardiac phases is thus a critical component toward fully automated CHD analysis. Yet, in the absence of fetal electrocardiography (ECG), manual identification of ED and ES frames remains a labor-intensive bottleneck. We present ORBIT (Orientation-Robust Beat Inference from Trajectories), a self-supervised framework that identifies cardiac phases without manual annotations under various fetal heart orientation. ORBIT employs registration as self-supervision task and learns a latent motion trajectory of cardiac deformation, whose turning points capture transitions between cardiac relaxation and contraction, enabling accurate and orientation-robust localization of ED and ES frames across diverse fetal positions. Trained exclusively on normal fetal echocardiography videos, ORBIT achieves consistent performance on both normal (MAE = 1.9 frames for ED and 1.6 for ES) and CHD cases (MAE = 2.4 frames for ED and 2.1 for ES), outperforming existing annotation-free approaches constrained by fixed orientation assumptions. These results highlight the potential of ORBIT to facilitate robust cardiac phase detection directly from 4CH fetal echocardiography.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint, Submitted to a journal</p></details> |

Moreover, ensuring that robot trajectories are similar to how a human moves will increase the acceptance of the robot in human environments. In this paper, we present Crowd-FM, a learning-based approach to address both safety and human-likeness challenges. Our approach has two novel components. First, we train a Conditional Flow-Matching (CFM) policy over a dataset of optimally controlled trajectories to learn a set of collision-free primitives that a robot can choose at any given scenario. The chosen optimal control solver can generate multi-modal collision-free trajectories, allowing the CFM policy to learn a diverse set of maneuvers. Secondly, we learn a score function over a dataset of human demonstration trajectories that provides a human-likeness score for the flow primitives. At inference time, computing the optimal trajectory requires selecting the one with the highest score. Our approach improves the state-of-the-art by showing that our CFM policy alone can produce collision-free navigation with a higher success rate than existing learning-based baselines. Furthermore, when augmented with inference-time refinement, our approach can outperform even expensive optimisation-based planning approaches. Finally, we validate that our scoring network can select trajectories closer to the expert data than a manually designed cost function.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IEEE ICRA 2026.

Model predictive path integral control is a framework that builds upon optimization principles while incorporating stochastic sampling of input trajectories. This paper investigates several sampling approaches for trajectory generation. In this context, normalizing flows originating from the field of variational inference are considered for the generation of sampling distributions, as they model transformations of simple to more complex distributions. Accordingly, learning-based normalizing flow models are trained for a more efficient exploration of the input domain for the task at hand. The developed algorithm and the proposed sampling distributions are evaluated in two simulation scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to be published as part of the 2024 IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV), Jeju Shinhwa World, Jeju Island, Korea, June 2-5, 2024</p></details> |
| **[Force Generative Imitation Learning: Bridging Position Trajectory and Force Commands through Control Technique](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06620v1)** | 2026-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In contact-rich tasks, while position trajectories are often easy to obtain, appropriate force commands are typically unknown. Although it is conceivable to generate force commands using a pretrained foundation model such as Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, force control is highly dependent on the specific hardware of the robot, which makes the application of such models challenging. To bridge this gap, we propose a force generative model that estimates force commands from given position trajectories. However, when dealing with unseen position trajectories, the model struggles to generate accurate force commands. To address this, we introduce a feedback control mechanism. Our experiments reveal that feedback control does not converge when the force generative model has memory. We therefore adopt a model without memory, enabling stable feedback control. This approach allows the system to generate force commands effectively, even for unseen position trajectories, improving generalization for real-world robot writing tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for IEEE Access</p></details> |

Current safety measures predominantly focus on static input/output filtering. However, we argue that ensuring LLM agents reliability requires auditing the intermediate execution process. In this work, we formulate the task of Trajectory Anomaly Detection. The goal is not merely detection, but precise error localization. This capability is essential for enabling efficient rollback-and-retry. To achieve this, we construct TrajBench, a dataset synthesized via a perturb-and-complete strategy to cover diverse procedural anomalies. Using this benchmark, we investigate the capability of models in process supervision. We observe that general-purpose LLMs, even with zero-shot prompting, struggle to identify and localize these anomalies. This reveals that generalized capabilities do not automatically translate to process reliability. To address this, we propose TrajAD, a specialized verifier trained with fine-grained process supervision. Our approach outperforms baselines, demonstrating that specialized supervision is essential for building trustworthy agents.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 5 figures, 1 table</p></details> |
| **[FlowConsist: Make Your Flow Consistent with Real Trajectory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06346v1)** | 2026-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fast flow models accelerate the iterative sampling process by learning to directly predict ODE path integrals, enabling one-step or few-step generation. However, we argue that current fast-flow training paradigms suffer from two fundamental issues. First, conditional velocities constructed from randomly paired noise-data samples introduce systematic trajectory drift, preventing models from following a consistent ODE path. Second, the model's approximation errors accumulate over time steps, leading to severe deviations across long time intervals. To address these issues, we propose FlowConsist, a training framework designed to enforce trajectory consistency in fast flows. We propose a principled alternative that replaces conditional velocities with the marginal velocities predicted by the model itself, aligning optimization with the true trajectory. To further address error accumulation over time steps, we introduce a trajectory rectification strategy that aligns the marginal distributions of generated and real samples at every time step along the trajectory. Our method establishes a new state-of-the-art on ImageNet 256$\times$256, achieving an FID of 1.52 with only 1 sampling step.</p></details> |  |
| **[STFlow: Data-Coupled Flow Matching for Geometric Trajectory Simulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18647v2)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Simulating trajectories of dynamical systems is a fundamental problem in a wide range of fields such as molecular dynamics, biochemistry, and pedestrian dynamics. Machine learning has become an invaluable tool for scaling physics-based simulators and developing models directly from experimental data. In particular, recent advances in deep generative modeling and geometric deep learning enable probabilistic simulation by learning complex trajectory distributions while respecting intrinsic permutation and time-shift symmetries. However, trajectories of N-body systems are commonly characterized by high sensitivity to perturbations leading to bifurcations, as well as multi-scale temporal and spatial correlations. To address these challenges, we introduce STFlow (Spatio-Temporal Flow), a generative model based on graph neural networks and hierarchical convolutions. By incorporating data-dependent couplings within the Flow Matching framework, STFlow denoises starting from conditioned random-walks instead of Gaussian noise. This novel informed prior simplifies the learning task by reducing transport cost, increasing training and inference efficiency. We validate our approach on N-body systems, molecular dynamics, and human trajectory forecasting. Across these benchmarks, STFlow achieves the lowest prediction errors with fewer simulation steps and improved scalability.</p></details> | 18 pages, 12 figures |
| **[Characterizing Human Semantic Navigation in Concept Production as Trajectories in Embedding Space](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05971v1)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semantic representations can be framed as a structured, dynamic knowledge space through which humans navigate to retrieve and manipulate meaning. To investigate how humans traverse this geometry, we introduce a framework that represents concept production as navigation through embedding space. Using different transformer text embedding models, we construct participant-specific semantic trajectories based on cumulative embeddings and extract geometric and dynamical metrics, including distance to next, distance to centroid, entropy, velocity, and acceleration. These measures capture both scalar and directional aspects of semantic navigation, providing a computationally grounded view of semantic representation search as movement in a geometric space. We evaluate the framework on four datasets across different languages, spanning different property generation tasks: Neurodegenerative, Swear verbal fluency, Property listing task in Italian, and in German. Across these contexts, our approach distinguishes between clinical groups and concept types, offering a mathematical framework that requires minimal human intervention compared to typical labor-intensive linguistic pre-processing methods. Comparison with a non-cumulative approach reveals that cumulative embeddings work best for longer trajectories, whereas shorter ones may provide too little context, favoring the non-cumulative alternative. Critically, different embedding models yielded similar results, highlighting similarities between different learned representations despite different training pipelines. By framing semantic navigation as a structured trajectory through embedding space, bridging cognitive modeling with learned representation, thereby establishing a pipeline for quantifying semantic representation dynamics with applications in clinical research, cross-linguistic analysis, and the assessment of artificial cognition.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 6 figures (excluding refs/appendix).

| **[Multi-Agent Inverted Transformer for Flight Trajectory Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21004v2)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Flight trajectory prediction for multiple aircraft is essential and provides critical insights into how aircraft navigate within current air traffic flows. However, predicting multi-agent flight trajectories is inherently challenging. One of the major difficulties is modeling both the individual aircraft behaviors over time and the complex interactions between flights. Generating explainable prediction outcomes is also a challenge. Therefore, we propose a Multi-Agent Inverted Transformer, MAIFormer, as a novel neural architecture that predicts multi-agent flight trajectories. The proposed framework features two key attention modules: (i) masked multivariate attention, which captures spatio-temporal patterns of individual aircraft, and (ii) agent attention, which models the social patterns among multiple agents in complex air traffic scenes. We evaluated MAIFormer using a real-world automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast flight trajectory dataset from the terminal airspace of Incheon International Airport in South Korea. The experimental results show that MAIFormer achieves the best performance across multiple metrics and outperforms other methods. In addition, MAIFormer produces prediction outcomes that are interpretable from a human perspective, which improves both the transparency of the model and its practical utility in air traffic control.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 8 figures, submitted for IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation System</p></details> |
| **[Bifrost: Steering Strategic Trajectories to Bridge Contextual Gaps for Self-Improving Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05810v1)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous agents excel in self-improvement through reflection and iterative refinement, which reuse successful task trajectories as in-context examples to assist subsequent reasoning. However, shifting across tasks often introduces a context mismatch. Hence, existing approaches either discard the trajectories or manipulate them using heuristics, leading to a non-negligible fine-tuning cost or unguaranteed performance. To bridge this gap, we reveal a context-trajectory correlation, where shifts of context are highly parallel with shifts of trajectory. Based on this finding, we propose BrIdge contextual gap FoR imprOvised trajectory STeering (Bifrost), a training-free method that leverages context differences to precisely guide the adaptation of previously solved trajectories towards the target task, mitigating the misalignment caused by context shifts. Our trajectory adaptation is conducted at the representation level using agent hidden states, ensuring trajectory transformation accurately aligns with the target context in a shared space. Across diverse benchmarks, Bifrost consistently outperforms existing trajectory reuse and finetuned self-improvement methods, demonstrating that agents can effectively leverage past experiences despite substantial context shifts.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Latent Signals to Reflection Behavior: Tracing Meta-Cognitive Activation Trajectory in R1-Style LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01999v2)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>R1-style LLMs have attracted growing attention for their capacity for self-reflection, yet the internal mechanisms underlying such behavior remain unclear. To bridge this gap, we anchor on the onset of reflection behavior and trace its layer-wise activation trajectory. Using the logit lens to read out token-level semantics, we uncover a structured progression: (i) Latent-control layers, where an approximate linear direction encodes the semantics of thinking budget; (ii) Semantic-pivot layers, where discourse-level cues, including turning-point and summarization cues, surface and dominate the probability mass; and (iii) Behavior-overt layers, where the likelihood of reflection-behavior tokens begins to rise until they become highly likely to be sampled. Moreover, our targeted interventions uncover a causal chain across these stages: prompt-level semantics modulate the projection of activations along latent-control directions, thereby inducing competition between turning-point and summarization cues in semantic-pivot layers, which in turn regulates the sampling likelihood of reflection-behavior tokens in behavior-overt layers. Collectively, our findings suggest a human-like meta-cognitive process-progressing from latent monitoring, to discourse-level regulation, and to finally overt self-reflection.

Without loosing any information, we associate to each state a binary random indicator function, taking values in $\{0,1\}$, and turn the problem of statistical description of the categorical trajectories into a multivariate functional principal components analysis. This viewpoint encompasses experimental frameworks where two or more states can be observed simultaneously. The sample paths being piecewise constant, with a finite number of jumps, this a rare case in functional data analysis in which the trajectories are not supposed to be continuous and can be observed exhaustively. Under the weak hypothesis assuming only continuity in probability of the $0-1$ trajectories, the means and the (multivariate) covariance function are continuous and have interpretations in terms of departure from independence of the joint probabilities. Considering a functional data point of view, we show that the binary trajectories, which are right-continuous functions with left-hand limits, can be seen as random elements in the Hilbert space of square integrable functions. The multivariate functional principal components are simple to interpret and we show that we can get consistent estimators of the mean trajectories and the covariance functions under weak regularity assumptions. The ability of the approach to represent categorical trajectories in a small dimension space is illustrated on a data set of sensory perceptions, considering different gustometer-controlled stimuli experiments.</p></details> |  |

Global-reference becomes ambiguous under multiple motions, while the local pointmap relies heavily on estimated relative poses and can drift, causing cross-frame misalignment and duplicated structures. We propose TrajVG, a reconstruction framework that makes cross-frame 3D correspondence an explicit prediction by estimating camera-coordinate 3D trajectories. We couple sparse trajectories, per-frame local point maps, and relative camera poses with geometric consistency objectives: (i) bidirectional trajectory-pointmap consistency with controlled gradient flow, and (ii) a pose consistency objective driven by static track anchors that suppresses gradients from dynamic regions. To scale training to in-the-wild videos where 3D trajectory labels are scarce, we reformulate the same coupling constraints into self-supervised objectives using only pseudo 2D tracks, enabling unified training with mixed supervision. Extensive experiments across 3D tracking, pose estimation, pointmap reconstruction, and video depth show that TrajVG surpasses the current feedforward performance baseline.</p></details> |  |

This paper presents a novel Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) framework that captures human-like decision-making by inferring diverse reward functions, enabling robust cross-scenario adaptability. The learned reward function is utilized to maximize the likelihood of output by integrating Mamba blocks for efficient long-sequence dependency modeling with graph attention networks to encode spatial interactions among traffic agents. Comprehensive evaluations on urban intersections and roundabouts demonstrate that the proposed method not only outperforms various popular approaches in terms of prediction accuracy but also achieves 2.3 times higher generalization performance to unseen scenarios compared to other baselines, achieving adaptability in Out-of-Distribution settings that is competitive with fine-tuning.</p></details> |  |

Traditional Markov chain approaches suffer from discretization artifacts and limited expressiveness. This paper proposes a physics-informed diffusion framework for conditional micro-trip synthesis, combining a dual-channel speed-acceleration representation with soft physics constraints that resolve optimization conflicts inherent to hard-constraint formulations. We compare a 1D U-Net architecture against a transformer-based Conditional Score-based Diffusion Imputation (CSDI) model using 6,367 GPS-derived micro-trips. CSDI achieves superior distribution matching (Wasserstein distance 0.30 for speed, 0.026 for acceleration), strong indistinguishability from real data (discriminative score 0.49), and validated utility for downstream energy assessment tasks. The methodology enables scalable generation of realistic driving profiles for intelligent transportation systems (ITS) applications without costly field data collection.</p></details> |  |

These trajectories consist of (\textit{person, time, location, activity type}) tuples recording when and where a person was born, went to school, started a job, or fought in a war. However, current studies only cover limited activity types such as births and deaths, lacking large-scale fine-grained trajectories. Using a tool that extracts (\textit{person, time, location}) triples from Wikipedia, we formulate the problem of classifying these triples into 24 carefully-defined types using textual context as complementary information. The challenge is that triple entities are often scattered in noisy contexts. We use syntactic graphs to bring triple entities and relevant information closer, fusing them with text embeddings to classify life trajectory activities. Since Wikipedia text quality varies, we use LLMs to refine the text for more standardized syntactic graphs. Our framework achieves 84.5\% accuracy, surpassing baselines. We construct the largest fine-grained life trajectory dataset with 3.8 million labeled activities for 589,193 individuals spanning 3 centuries. In the end, we showcase how these trajectories can support grand narratives of human dynamics across time and space. Code/data are publicly available.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond Rejection Sampling: Trajectory Fusion for Scaling Mathematical Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04391v1)** | 2026-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have made impressive strides in mathematical reasoning, often fine-tuned using rejection sampling that retains only correct reasoning trajectories. While effective, this paradigm treats supervision as a binary filter that systematically excludes teacher-generated errors, leaving a gap in how reasoning failures are modeled during training. In this paper, we propose TrajFusion, a fine-tuning strategy that reframes rejection sampling as a structured supervision construction process. Specifically, TrajFusion forms fused trajectories that explicitly model trial-and-error reasoning by interleaving selected incorrect trajectories with reflection prompts and correct trajectories. The length of each fused sample is adaptively controlled based on the frequency and diversity of teacher errors, providing richer supervision for challenging problems while safely reducing to vanilla rejection sampling fine-tuning (RFT) when error signals are uninformative. TrajFusion requires no changes to the architecture or training objective. Extensive experiments across multiple math benchmarks demonstrate that TrajFusion consistently outperforms RFT, particularly on challenging and long-form reasoning problems.</p></details> |  |

This paper proposes the SDD Planner, a diffusion-based framework designed to effectively reconcile safety constraints with driving styles in real time. The framework integrates two core modules: a Multi-Source Style-Aware Encoder, which employs distance-sensitive attention to fuse dynamic agent data and environmental contexts for heterogeneous safety-style perception; and a Style-Guided Dynamic Trajectory Generator, which adaptively modulates priority weights within the diffusion denoising process to generate user-preferred yet safe trajectories. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SDD Planner achieves state-of-the-art performance. On the StyleDrive benchmark, it improves the SM-PDMS metric by 3.9% over WoTE, the strongest baseline. Furthermore, on the NuPlan Test14 and Test14-hard benchmarks, SDD Planner ranks first with overall scores of 91.76 and 80.32, respectively, outperforming leading methods such as PLUTO. Real-vehicle closed-loop tests further confirm that SDD Planner maintains high safety standards while aligning with preset driving styles, validating its practical applicability for real-world deployment.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 7 figures, submitted to IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems</p></details> |

While existing driving video generation methods may produce visually realistic videos, they often fail to deliver physically realistic simulations because they lack the capability to generate accurate post-collision trajectories. In this paper, we introduce AccidentSim, a novel framework that generates physically realistic vehicle collision videos by extracting and utilizing the physical clues and contextual information available in real-world vehicle accident reports. Specifically, AccidentSim leverages a reliable physical simulator to replicate post-collision vehicle trajectories from the physical and contextual information in the accident reports and to build a vehicle collision trajectory dataset. This dataset is then used to fine-tune a language model, enabling it to respond to user prompts and predict physically consistent post-collision trajectories across various driving scenarios based on user descriptions. Finally, we employ Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) to render high-quality backgrounds, merging them with the foreground vehicles that exhibit physically realistic trajectories to generate vehicle collision videos. Experimental results demonstrate that the videos produced by AccidentSim excel in both visual and physical authenticity.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 9 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

In this work, we propose GeneralVLA (Generalizable Vision-Language-Action Models with Knowledge-Guided Trajectory Planning), a hierarchical vision-language-action (VLA) model that can be more effective in utilizing the generalization of foundation models, enabling zero-shot manipulation and automatically generating data for robotics. In particular, we study a class of hierarchical VLA model where the high-level ASM (Affordance Segmentation Module) is finetuned to perceive image keypoint affordances of the scene; the mid-level 3DAgent carries out task understanding, skill knowledge, and trajectory planning to produce a 3D path indicating the desired robot end-effector trajectory. The intermediate 3D path prediction is then served as guidance to the low-level, 3D-aware control policy capable of precise manipulation. Compared to alternative approaches, our method requires no real-world robotic data collection or human demonstration, making it much more scalable to diverse tasks and viewpoints. Empirically, GeneralVLA successfully generates trajectories for 14 tasks, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods such as VoxPoser. The generated demonstrations can train more robust behavior cloning policies than training with human demonstrations or from data generated by VoxPoser, Scaling-up, and Code-As-Policies. We believe GeneralVLA can be the scalable method for both generating data for robotics and solving novel tasks in a zero-shot setting. Code: https://github.com/AIGeeksGroup/GeneralVLA.

However, existing approaches suffer from prior misalignment. Their learned or fixed priors often fail to capture the full distribution of plausible futures, limiting both prediction accuracy and diversity. We theoretically establish that prediction error is lower-bounded by prior quality, making prior modeling a key performance bottleneck. Guided by this insight, we propose AGMA (Adaptive Gaussian Mixture Anchors), which constructs expressive priors through two stages: extracting diverse behavioral patterns from training data and distilling them into a scene-adaptive global prior for inference. Extensive experiments on ETH-UCY, Stanford Drone, and JRDB datasets demonstrate that AGMA achieves state-of-the-art performance, confirming the critical role of high-quality priors in trajectory forecasting.</p></details> | 14 pages, 3 figures |

Real-world trajectory data frequently exhibit heterogeneity across subjects such as patients, sites, and subpopulations, yet many traditional methods are not designed to accommodate such heterogeneity in data analysis. To address this, we propose a unified framework, termed Functional Singular Value Decomposition (FSVD), for statistical learning with heterogeneous trajectories. We establish the theoretical foundations of FSVD and develop a corresponding estimation algorithm that accommodates noisy and irregular observations. We further adapt FSVD to a wide range of trajectory-learning tasks, including dimension reduction, factor modeling, regression, clustering, and data completion, while preserving its ability to account for heterogeneity, leverage inherent smoothness, and handle irregular sampling. Through extensive simulations, we demonstrate that FSVD-based methods consistently outperform existing approaches across these tasks. Finally, we apply FSVD to a COVID-19 case-count dataset and electronic health record datasets, showcasing its effective performance in global and subgroup pattern discovery and factor analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>Journ...</summary><p>Journal of the American Statistical Association, to appear</p></details> |

However, constructing such data at scale remains challenging due to two key requirements: \textbf{\emph{Executability}}, since each instance requires a suitable and often distinct Docker environment; and \textbf{\emph{Verifiability}}, because heterogeneous task outputs preclude unified, standardized verification. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{TerminalTraj}, a scalable pipeline that (i) filters high-quality repositories to construct Dockerized execution environments, (ii) generates Docker-aligned task instances, and (iii) synthesizes agent trajectories with executable validation code. Using TerminalTraj, we curate 32K Docker images and generate 50,733 verified terminal trajectories across eight domains. Models trained on this data with the Qwen2.5-Coder backbone achieve consistent performance improvements on TerminalBench (TB), with gains of up to 20\% on TB~1.0 and 10\% on TB~2.0 over their respective backbones. Notably, \textbf{TerminalTraj-32B} achieves strong performance among models with fewer than 100B parameters, reaching 35.30\% on TB~1.0 and 22.00\% on TB~2.0, and demonstrates improved test-time scaling behavior.

However, current benchmarks are impeded by a notable scarcity of scenarios featuring dense traffic, which is essential for understanding and modeling complex interactions among road users. To address this gap, we collaborated with our industrial partner, DeepScenario, to develop DeepUrban-a new drone dataset designed to enhance trajectory prediction and planning benchmarks focusing on dense urban settings. DeepUrban provides a rich collection of 3D traffic objects, extracted from high-resolution images captured over urban intersections at approximately 100 meters altitude. The dataset is further enriched with comprehensive map and scene information to support advanced modeling and simulation tasks. We evaluate state-of-the-art (SOTA) prediction and planning methods, and conducted experiments on generalization capabilities. Our findings demonstrate that adding DeepUrban to nuScenes can boost the accuracy of vehicle predictions and planning, achieving improvements up to 44.1 % / 44.3% on the ADE / FDE metrics.

The current approaches focus on reinforcement learning (RL) and generative models. These efforts imitate offline historical behaviors by utilizing a complex structure with expensive hyperparameter tuning. The suboptimal trajectories further exacerbate the difficulty of policy learning. To address these challenges, we proposes QGA, a novel Q-value regularized Generative Auto-bidding method. In QGA, we propose to plug a Q-value regularization with double Q-learning strategy into the Decision Transformer backbone. This design enables joint optimization of policy imitation and action-value maximization, allowing the learned bidding policy to both leverage experience from the dataset and alleviate the adverse impact of the suboptimal trajectories. Furthermore, to safely explore the policy space beyond the data distribution, we propose a Q-value guided dual-exploration mechanism, in which the DT model is conditioned on multiple return-to-go targets and locally perturbed actions. This entire exploration process is dynamically guided by the aforementioned Q-value module, which provides principled evaluation for each candidate action. Experiments on public benchmarks and simulation environments demonstrate that QGA consistently achieves superior or highly competitive results compared to existing alternatives. Notably, in large-scale real-world A/B testing, QGA achieves a 3.27% increase in Ad GMV and a 2.49% improvement in Ad ROI.</p></details> | <details><summary>Due t...</summary><p>Due to the company's compliance requirements, we would like to wait until the paper is officially published before making it publicly available on arXiv</p></details> |
| **[TMS: Trajectory-Mixed Supervision for Reward-Free, On-Policy SFT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03073v1)** | 2026-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) are the two dominant paradigms for enhancing Large Language Model (LLM) performance on downstream tasks. While RL generally preserves broader model capabilities (retention) better than SFT, it comes with significant costs: complex reward engineering, instability, and expensive on-policy sampling. In contrast, SFT is efficient but brittle, often suffering from catastrophic forgetting due to $\textbf{Supervision Mismatch}$: the divergence between the model's evolving policy and static training labels. We address this trade-off with $\textbf{Trajectory-Mixed Supervision (TMS)}$, a reward-free framework that approximates the on-policy benefits of RL by creating a dynamic curriculum from the model's own historical checkpoints. TMS minimizes $\textit{Policy-Label Divergence (PLD)}$, preventing the mode collapse that drives forgetting in standard SFT. Experiments across reasoning (MATH, GSM8K) and instruction-following benchmarks demonstrate that TMS effectively shifts the accuracy--retention Pareto frontier. While RL remains the gold standard for retention, TMS significantly outperforms standard and iterative SFT, bridging the gap to RL without requiring reward models or verifiers. Mechanistic analysis confirms that PLD drift accurately predicts forgetting and that TMS successfully mitigates this drift.</p></details> |  |

Maintaining safe operation under impairment to achieve task completion, i.e. fail-active operation, is our target. Focusing on actuation failures, we introduce DEFT, a diffusion-based trajectory generator conditioned on the robot's current embodiment and task constraints. DEFT generalizes across failure types, supports constrained and unconstrained motions, and enables task completion under arbitrary failure. We evaluated DEFT in both simulation and real-world scenarios using a 7-DoF robotic arm. In simulation over thousands of joint-failure cases across multiple tasks, DEFT outperformed the baseline by up to 2 times. On failures unseen during training, it continued to outperform the baseline, indicating robust generalization in simulation. Further, we performed real-world evaluations on two multi-step tasks, drawer manipulation and whiteboard erasing. These experiments demonstrated DEFT succeeding on tasks where classical methods failed. Our results show that DEFT achieves fail-active manipulation across arbitrary failure configurations and real-world deployments.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be published in the 2026 IEEE International Conference on Robotics & Automation</p></details> |

This linear design makes it difficult to revisit earlier states, branch into alternative search directions, or maintain global awareness under long contexts, often leading to local optima, redundant exploration, and inefficient search. We propose Re-TRAC, an agentic framework that performs cross-trajectory exploration by generating a structured state representation after each trajectory to summarize evidence, uncertainties, failures, and future plans, and conditioning subsequent trajectories on this state representation. This enables iterative reflection and globally informed planning, reframing research as a progressive process. Empirical results show that Re-TRAC consistently outperforms ReAct by 15-20% on BrowseComp with frontier LLMs. For smaller models, we introduce Re-TRAC-aware supervised fine-tuning, achieving state-of-the-art performance at comparable scales. Notably, Re-TRAC shows a monotonic reduction in tool calls and token usage across rounds, indicating progressively targeted exploration driven by cross-trajectory reflection rather than redundant search.</p></details> |  |
| **[AgentRx: Diagnosing AI Agent Failures from Execution Trajectories](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02475v1)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>AI agents often fail in ways that are difficult to localize because executions are probabilistic, long-horizon, multi-agent, and mediated by noisy tool outputs. We address this gap by manually annotating failed agent runs and release a novel benchmark of 115 failed trajectories spanning structured API workflows, incident management, and open-ended web/file tasks. Each trajectory is annotated with a critical failure step and a category from a grounded-theory derived, cross-domain failure taxonomy. To mitigate the human cost of failure attribution, we present AGENTRX, an automated domain-agnostic diagnostic framework that pinpoints the critical failure step in a failed agent trajectory. It synthesizes constraints, evaluates them step-by-step, and produces an auditable validation log of constraint violations with associated evidence; an LLM-based judge uses this log to localize the critical step and category. Our framework improves step localization and failure attribution over existing baselines across three domains.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reusing Trajectories in Policy Gradients Enables Fast Convergence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06178v2)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Policy gradient (PG) methods are a class of effective reinforcement learning algorithms, particularly when dealing with continuous control problems. They rely on fresh on-policy data, making them sample-inefficient and requiring $O(ε^{-2})$ trajectories to reach an $ε$-approximate stationary point. A common strategy to improve efficiency is to reuse information from past iterations, such as previous gradients or trajectories, leading to off-policy PG methods. While gradient reuse has received substantial attention, leading to improved rates up to $O(ε^{-3/2})$, the reuse of past trajectories, although intuitive, remains largely unexplored from a theoretical perspective. In this work, we provide the first rigorous theoretical evidence that reusing past off-policy trajectories can significantly accelerate PG convergence. We propose RT-PG (Reusing Trajectories - Policy Gradient), a novel algorithm that leverages a power mean-corrected multiple importance weighting estimator to effectively combine on-policy and off-policy data coming from the most recent $ω$ iterations. Through a novel analysis, we prove that RT-PG achieves a sample complexity of $\widetilde{O}(ε^{-2}ω^{-1})$. When reusing all available past trajectories, this leads to a rate of $\widetilde{O}(ε^{-1})$, the best known one in the literature for PG methods. We further validate our approach empirically, demonstrating its effectiveness against baselines with state-of-the-art rates.</p></details> |  |
| **[FlowBypass: Rectified Flow Trajectory Bypass for Training-Free Image Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01805v1)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Training-free image editing has attracted increasing attention for its efficiency and independence from training data. However, existing approaches predominantly rely on inversion-reconstruction trajectories, which impose an inherent trade-off: longer trajectories accumulate errors and compromise fidelity, while shorter ones fail to ensure sufficient alignment with the edit prompt. Previous attempts to address this issue typically employ backbone-specific feature manipulations, limiting general applicability. To address these challenges, we propose FlowBypass, a novel and analytical framework grounded in Rectified Flow that constructs a bypass directly connecting inversion and reconstruction trajectories, thereby mitigating error accumulation without relying on feature manipulations. We provide a formal derivation of two trajectories, from which we obtain an approximate bypass formulation and its numerical solution, enabling seamless trajectory transitions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FlowBypass consistently outperforms state-of-the-art image editing methods, achieving stronger prompt alignment while preserving high-fidelity details in irrelevant regions.</p></details> |  |

The majority of existing placement campaigns either follow standard `space-filling' designs or relatively ad-hoc expert opinions. A key challenge to applying principled active learning in this setting is that Lagrangian observers are continuously advected through the vector field, so they make measurements at different locations and times. It is, therefore, important to consider the likely future trajectories of placed observers to account for the utility of candidate placement locations. To this end, we present BALLAST: Bayesian Active Learning with Look-ahead Amendment for Sea-drifter Trajectories. We observe noticeable benefits of BALLAST-aided sequential observer placement strategies on both synthetic and high-fidelity ocean current models. In addition, we developed a novel GP inference method -- the Vanilla SPDE Exchange (VaSE) -- to boost the GP posterior sampling efficiency, which is also of independent interest.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mitigating loss of control in advanced AI systems through instrumental goal trajectories](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01699v1)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Researchers at artificial intelligence labs and universities are concerned that highly capable artificial intelligence (AI) systems may erode human control by pursuing instrumental goals. Existing mitigations remain largely technical and system-centric: tracking capability in advanced systems, shaping behaviour through methods such as reinforcement learning from human feedback, and designing systems to be corrigible and interruptible. Here we develop instrumental goal trajectories to expand these options beyond the model. Gaining capability typically depends on access to additional technical resources, such as compute, storage, data and adjacent services, which in turn requires access to monetary resources. In organisations, these resources can be obtained through three organisational pathways. We label these pathways the procurement, governance and finance instrumental goal trajectories (IGTs). Each IGT produces a trail of organisational artefacts that can be monitored and used as intervention points when a systems capabilities or behaviour exceed acceptable thresholds. In this way, IGTs offer concrete avenues for defining capability levels and for broadening how corrigibility and interruptibility are implemented, shifting attention from model properties alone to the organisational systems that enable them.</p></details> |  |

Segmentation-oriented industrial anomaly synthesis (SIAS) has emerged as a promising alternative; however, existing methods struggle to balance sampling efficiency and generation quality. Moreover, most approaches treat all spatial regions uniformly, overlooking the distinct statistical differences between anomaly and background areas. This uniform treatment hinders the synthesis of controllable, structure-specific anomalies tailored for segmentation tasks. In this paper, we propose FAST, a foreground-aware diffusion framework featuring two novel modules: the Anomaly-Informed Accelerated Sampling (AIAS) and the Foreground-Aware Reconstruction Module (FARM). AIAS is a training-free sampling algorithm specifically designed for segmentation-oriented industrial anomaly synthesis, which accelerates the reverse process through coarse-to-fine aggregation and enables the synthesis of state-of-the-art segmentation-oriented anomalies in as few as 10 steps. Meanwhile, FARM adaptively adjusts the anomaly-aware noise within the masked foreground regions at each sampling step, preserving localized anomaly signals throughout the denoising trajectory. Extensive experiments on multiple industrial benchmarks demonstrate that FAST consistently outperforms existing anomaly synthesis methods in downstream segmentation tasks. We release the code at: https://github.com/Chhro123/fast-foreground-aware-anomaly-synthesis.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

Because both mechanisms can yield identical task success on the original interface, benchmark scores alone are not identifiable evidence of environment-invariant capability. We propose PIPE, a protocol-level evaluation augmentation for diagnosing interface reliance by minimally rewriting environment interfaces while preserving task semantics and execution behavior. Across 16 environments from AgentBench and AgentGym and a range of open-source and API-based agents, PIPE reveals that trajectory-SFT substantially amplifies interface shortcutting: trained agents degrade sharply under minimal interface rewrites, while non-trajectory-trained models remain largely stable. We further introduce Interface Reliance (IR), a counterbalanced alias-based metric that quantifies preference for training-time interfaces, and show that interface shortcutting exhibits environment-dependent, non-monotonic training dynamics that remain invisible under standard evaluation. Our code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/What-Do-Agents-Learn-from-Trajectory-SFT-Semantics-or-Interfaces--0831/.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we propose an efficient controller for trajectory tracking of marine vehicles under unknown disturbances by combining a convex error-state MPC on the Lie group augmented by an online learning module to compensate for these disturbances in real time. This design enables adaptive and robust tracking control while maintaining computational efficiency. Extensive evaluations in the Virtual RobotX (VRX) simulator, and real-world field experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior tracking accuracy under various disturbance scenarios compared with existing approaches.</p></details> |  |

| **[Learning to Approximate Uniform Facility Location via Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13155v1)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>There has been a growing interest in using neural networks, especially message-passing neural networks (MPNNs), to solve hard combinatorial optimization problems heuristically. However, existing learning-based approaches for hard combinatorial optimization tasks often rely on supervised training data, reinforcement learning, or gradient estimators, leading to significant computational overhead, unstable training, or a lack of provable performance guarantees. In contrast, classical approximation algorithms offer such performance guarantees under worst-case inputs but are non-differentiable and unable to adaptively exploit structural regularities in natural input distributions. We address this dichotomy with the fundamental example of Uniform Facility Location (UniFL), a variant of the combinatorial facility location problem with applications in clustering, data summarization, logistics, and supply chain design. We develop a fully differentiable MPNN model that embeds approximation-algorithmic principles while avoiding the need for solver supervision or discrete relaxations. Our approach admits provable approximation and size generalization guarantees to much larger instances than seen during training. Empirically, we show that our approach outperforms standard non-learned approximation algorithms in terms of solution quality, closing the gap with computationally intensive integer linear programming approaches. Overall, this work provides a step toward bridging learning-based methods and approximation algorithms for discrete optimization.</p></details> |  |

We show that a missing principle is making GNN-MD IO-aware, carefully accounting for reads and writes between GPU high-bandwidth memory (HBM) and on-chip SRAM. We present FlashSchNet, an efficient and accurate IO-aware SchNet-style GNN-MD framework built on four techniques: (1) flash radial basis, which fuses pairwise distance computation, Gaussian basis expansion, and cosine envelope into a single tiled pass, computing each distance once and reusing it across all basis functions; (2) flash message passing, which fuses cutoff, neighbor gather, filter multiplication, and reduction to avoid materializing edge tensors in HBM; (3) flash aggregation, which reformulates scatter-add via CSR segment reduce, reducing atomic writes by a factor of feature dimension and enabling contention-free accumulation in both forward and backward passes; (4) channel-wise 16-bit quantization that exploits the low per-channel dynamic range in SchNet MLP weights to further improve throughput with negligible accuracy loss. On a single NVIDIA RTX PRO 6000, FlashSchNet achieves 1000 ns/day aggregate simulation throughput over 64 parallel replicas on coarse-grained (CG) protein containing 269 beads (6.5x faster than CGSchNet baseline with 80% reduction of peak memory), surpassing classical force fields (e.g. MARTINI) while retaining SchNet-level accuracy and transferability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code is at https://github.com/UNITES-Lab/flash-molecular-dynamics</p></details> |
| **[Which Algorithms Can Graph Neural Networks Learn?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13106v1)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, there has been growing interest in understanding neural architectures' ability to learn to execute discrete algorithms, a line of work often referred to as neural algorithmic reasoning. The goal is to integrate algorithmic reasoning capabilities into larger neural pipelines. Many such architectures are based on (message-passing) graph neural networks (MPNNs), owing to their permutation equivariance and ability to deal with sparsity and variable-sized inputs. However, existing work is either largely empirical and lacks formal guarantees or it focuses solely on expressivity, leaving open the question of when and how such architectures generalize beyond a finite training set. In this work, we propose a general theoretical framework that characterizes the sufficient conditions under which MPNNs can learn an algorithm from a training set of small instances and provably approximate its behavior on inputs of arbitrary size. Our framework applies to a broad class of algorithms, including single-source shortest paths, minimum spanning trees, and general dynamic programming problems, such as the $0$-$1$ knapsack problem. In addition, we establish impossibility results for a wide range of algorithmic tasks, showing that standard MPNNs cannot learn them, and we derive more expressive MPNN-like architectures that overcome these limitations. Finally, we refine our analysis for the Bellman-Ford algorithm, yielding a substantially smaller required training set and significantly extending the recent work of Nerem et al. [2025] by allowing for a differentiable regularization loss. Empirical results largely support our theoretical findings.</p></details> |  |

Recent advances in Vicinal Risk Minimization (VRM) have shown promise in mitigating class imbalance with numeric interpolation; however, existing approaches largely rely on embedding-space arithmetic, which fails to capture the rich semantics inherent in text-attributed graphs. In this work, we propose our method, SaVe-TAG (Semantic-aware Vicinal Risk Minimization for Long-Tailed Text-Attributed Graphs), a novel VRM framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform text-level interpolation, generating on-manifold, boundary-enriching synthetic samples for minority classes. To mitigate the risk of noisy generation, we introduce a confidence-based edge assignment mechanism that uses graph topology as a natural filter to ensure structural consistency. We provide theoretical justification for our method and conduct extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, showing that our approach consistently outperforms both numeric interpolation and prior long-tailed node classification baselines. Our results highlight the importance of integrating semantic and structural signals for balanced and effective learning on text-attributed graphs.

However, existing TGNNs primarily target one-time predictions for a given temporal span, whereas many practical applications require continuous predictions, that predictions are issued frequently over time. Directly adapting existing TGNNs to continuous-prediction scenarios introduces either significant computational overhead or prediction quality issues especially for large graphs. This paper revisits the challenge of { continuous predictions} in TGNNs, and introduces {\sc Coden}, a TGNN model designed for efficient and effective learning on dynamic graphs. {\sc Coden} innovatively overcomes the key complexity bottleneck in existing TGNNs while preserving comparable predictive accuracy. Moreover, we further provide theoretical analyses that substantiate the effectiveness and efficiency of {\sc Coden}, and clarify its duality relationship with both RNN-based and attention-based models. Our evaluations across five dynamic datasets show that {\sc Coden} surpasses existing performance benchmarks in both efficiency and effectiveness, establishing it as a superior solution for continuous prediction in evolving graph environments.</p></details> |  |

Despite existing applications of deep learning in land use monitoring, standard convolutional kernels in deep neural networks limit the applications of these networks to the Euclidean domain only. Considering the geodesic nature of the measurement of the earth's surface, remote sensing is one such area that can benefit from non-Euclidean and spherical domains. For this purpose, we designed a novel Graph Neural Network architecture for spatial and spatio-temporal classification using satellite imagery to acquire insights into socio-economic indicators. We propose a hybrid attention method to learn the relative importance of irregular neighbors in remote sensing data. Instead of classifying each pixel, we propose a method based on Simple Linear Iterative Clustering (SLIC) image segmentation and Graph Attention Network. The superpixels obtained from SLIC become the nodes of our Graph Convolution Network (GCN). A region adjacency graph (RAG) is then constructed where each superpixel is connected to every other adjacent superpixel in the image, enabling information to propagate globally. Finally, we propose a Spatially driven Attention Graph Neural Network (SAG-NN) to classify each RAG. We also propose an extension to our SAG-NN for spatio-temporal data. Unlike regular grids of pixels in images, superpixels are irregular in nature and cannot be used to create spatio-temporal graphs. We introduce temporal bias by combining unconnected RAGs from each image into one supergraph. This is achieved by introducing block adjacency matrices resulting in novel Spatio-Temporal driven Attention Graph Neural Network with Block Adjacency matrix (STAG-NN-BA). SAG-NN and STAG-NN-BA outperform graph and non-graph baselines on Asia14 and C2D2 datasets efficiently.</p></details> |  |
| **[RLMiner: Finding the Most Frequent k-sized Subgraph via Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12416v2)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Identifying the most frequent induced subgraph of size $k$ in a target graph is a fundamental graph mining problem with direct implications for Web-related data mining and social network analysis. Despite its importance, finding the most frequent induced subgraph remains computationally expensive due to the NP-hard nature of the subgraph counting task. Traditional exact enumeration algorithms often suffer from high time complexity, especially for a large graph size $k$. To mitigate this, existing approaches often utilize frequency measurement with the Downward Closure Property to reduce the search space, imposing additional constraints on the task. In this paper, we first formulate this task as a Markov Decision Process and approach it using a multi-task reinforcement learning framework. Specifically, we introduce RLMiner, a novel framework that integrates reinforcement learning with our proposed task-state-aware Graph Neural Network to find the most frequent induced subgraph of size $k$ with a time complexity linear to $k$. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed RLMiner effectively identifies subgraphs with frequencies closely matching the ground-truth most frequent induced subgraphs, while achieving significantly shorter and more stable running times compared to traditional methods.</p></details> |  |

We show that these wavelets may be effectively incorporated into a family of geometric graph neural networks, which we refer to as VDW-GNNs. We demonstrate that such networks are effective on synthetic point cloud data, as well as on real-world data derived from wind-field measurements and neural activity data. Theoretically, we prove that these new wavelets have desirable frame theoretic properties, similar to traditional diffusion wavelets. Additionally, we prove that these wavelets have desirable symmetries with respect to rotations and translations.</p></details> | <details><summary>A pre...</summary><p>A previous, shorter version of this work was presented in the workshop "New Perspectives in Advancing Graph Machine Learning" at NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

Moreover, iterative message passing limits scalability due to neighborhood expansion overhead. We introduce ATLAS (Adaptive Topology-based Learning at Scale), a propagation-free framework that encodes graph structure through multi-resolution community features rather than message passing. We first prove that community refinement involves a fundamental trade-off: finer partitions increase label-community mutual information but also increase entropy. We formalize when refinement improves normalized mutual information, explaining why intermediate granularities are often most predictive. ATLAS employs modularity-guided adaptive search to automatically identify informative community scales, which are one-hot encoded, projected into learnable embeddings, and concatenated with node attributes for MLP classification. This enables standard mini-batch training and adjacency-free inference after one-time preprocessing. Across 13 benchmarks including million-node graphs, ATLAS achieves competitive or superior accuracy, up to 20-point gains over GCN on heterophilic datasets and 12-point gains over MLPs on homophilic graphs. By treating topology as explicit features, ATLAS adapts intelligently: leveraging structure when informative, remaining robust when weakly aligned, and avoiding propagation when structure misleads, providing both scalable performance and interpretable structural insights.</p></details> | Preprint |
| **[Bayesian Neighborhood Adaptation for Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05358v2)** | 2026-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The neighborhood scope (i.e., number of hops) where graph neural networks (GNNs) aggregate information to characterize a node's statistical property is critical to GNNs' performance. Two-stage approaches, training and validating GNNs for every pre-specified neighborhood scope to search for the best setting, is a time-consuming task and tends to be biased due to the search space design. How to adaptively determine proper neighborhood scopes for the aggregation process for both homophilic and heterophilic graphs remains largely unexplored. We thus propose to model the GNNs' message-passing behavior on a graph as a stochastic process by treating the number of hops as a beta process. This Bayesian framework allows us to infer the most plausible neighborhood scope for message aggregation simultaneously with the optimization of GNN parameters. Our theoretical analysis shows that the scope inference improves the expressivity of a GNN. Experiments on benchmark homophilic and heterophilic datasets show that the proposed method is compatible with state-of-the-art GNN variants, achieving competitive or superior performance on the node classification task, and providing well-calibrated predictions.

Such representations are beneficial in the unsupervised learning of clusters and community detection. Nonetheless, such inference may reveal sensitive groups, clustered systems, or collective behaviors, raising concerns regarding group-level privacy. Community attribution in social and critical infrastructure networks, for example, can expose coordinated asset groups, operational hierarchies, and system dependencies that could be used for profiling or intelligence gathering. We study a defensive setting in which a data publisher (defender) seeks to conceal a community of interest while making limited, utility-aware changes in the network. Our analysis indicates that community concealment is strongly influenced by two quantifiable factors: connectivity at the community boundary and feature similarity between the protected community and adjacent communities. Informed by these findings, we present a perturbation strategy that rewires a set of selected edges and modifies node features to reduce the distinctiveness leveraged by GNN message passing. The proposed method outperforms DICE in our experiments on synthetic benchmarks and real network graphs under identical perturbation budgets. Overall, it achieves median relative concealment improvements of approximately 20-45% across the evaluated settings. These findings demonstrate a mitigation strategy against GNN-based community learning and highlight group-level privacy risks intrinsic to graph learning.</p></details> |  |

This work introduces RokomariBG, a large-scale, multi-entity heterogeneous book graph dataset designed to support research on personalized recommendation in a low-resource language setting. The dataset comprises 127,302 books, 63,723 users, 16,601 authors, 1,515 categories, 2,757 publishers, and 209,602 reviews, connected through eight relation types and organized as a comprehensive knowledge graph. To demonstrate the utility of the dataset, we provide a systematic benchmarking study on the Top-N recommendation task, evaluating a diverse set of representative recommendation models, including classical collaborative filtering methods, matrix factorization models, content-based approaches, graph neural networks, a hybrid matrix factorization model with side information, and a neural two-tower retrieval architecture. The benchmarking results highlight the importance of leveraging multi-relational structure and textual side information, with neural retrieval models achieving the strongest performance (NDCG@10 = 0.204). Overall, this work establishes a foundational benchmark and a publicly available resource for Bangla book recommendation research, enabling reproducible evaluation and future studies on recommendation in low-resource cultural domains.

| **[Self-Adaptive Graph Mixture of Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13062v2)** | 2026-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful tools for learning over graph-structured data, yet recent studies have shown that their performance gains are beginning to plateau. In many cases, well-established models such as GCN and GAT, when appropriately tuned, can match or even exceed the performance of more complex, state-of-the-art architectures. This trend highlights a key limitation in the current landscape: the difficulty of selecting the most suitable model for a given graph task or dataset. To address this, we propose Self-Adaptive Graph Mixture of Models (SAGMM), a modular and practical framework that learns to automatically select and combine the most appropriate GNN models from a diverse pool of architectures. Unlike prior mixture-of-experts approaches that rely on variations of a single base model, SAGMM leverages architectural diversity and a topology-aware attention gating mechanism to adaptively assign experts to each node based on the structure of the input graph. To improve efficiency, SAGMM includes a pruning mechanism that reduces the number of active experts during training and inference without compromising performance. We also explore a training-efficient variant in which expert models are pretrained and frozen, and only the gating and task-specific layers are trained. We evaluate SAGMM on 16 benchmark datasets covering node classification, graph classification, regression, and link prediction tasks, and demonstrate that it consistently outperforms or matches leading GNN baselines and prior mixture-based methods, offering a robust and adaptive solution for real-world graph learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2026</p></details> |
| **[GP2F: Cross-Domain Graph Prompting with Adaptive Fusion of Pre-trained Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11629v1)** | 2026-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Prompt Learning (GPL) has recently emerged as a promising paradigm for downstream adaptation of pre-trained graph models, mitigating the misalignment between pre-training objectives and downstream tasks. Recently, the focus of GPL has shifted from in-domain to cross-domain scenarios, which is closer to the real world applications, where the pre-training source and downstream target often differ substantially in data distribution. However, why GPLs remain effective under such domain shifts is still unexplored. Empirically, we observe that representative GPL methods are competitive with two simple baselines in cross-domain settings: full fine-tuning (FT) and linear probing (LP), motivating us to explore a deeper understanding of the prompting mechanism. We provide a theoretical analysis demonstrating that jointly leveraging these two complementary branches yields a smaller estimation error than using either branch alone, formally proving that cross-domain GPL benefits from the integration between pre-trained knowledge and task-specific adaptation. Based on this insight, we propose GP2F, a dual-branch GPL method that explicitly instantiates the two extremes: (1) a frozen branch that retains pre-trained knowledge, and (2) an adapted branch with lightweight adapters for task-specific adaptation. We then perform adaptive fusion under topology constraints via a contrastive loss and a topology-consistent loss. Extensive experiments on cross-domain few-shot node and graph classification demonstrate that our method outperforms existing methods.</p></details> | 16 pages, 8 figures |

However, such data are inherently heterogeneous, high-dimensional, and exhibit complex intra- and inter-modality dependencies. Graph neural networks (GNNs) offer a principled framework for modeling these structures, but existing approaches often rely on prior knowledge or predefined similarity networks that produce undirected or unweighted graphs and fail to capture task-specific directionality and interaction strength. Interpretability at both the modality and feature levels also remains limited. To address these challenges, we propose TF-DWGNet, a novel Graph Neural Network framework that combines tree-based Directed Weighted graph construction with Tensor Fusion for multiclass cancer subtype classification. TF-DWGNet introduces two key innovations: (i) a supervised tree-based strategy that constructs directed, weighted graphs tailored to each omics modality, and (ii) a tensor fusion mechanism that captures unimodal, bimodal, and trimodal interactions using low-rank decomposition for computational efficiency. Experiments on three real-world cancer datasets demonstrate that TF-DWGNet consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across multiple metrics and statistical tests. In addition, the model provides biologically meaningful insights through modality-level contribution scores and ranked feature importance. These results highlight that TF-DWGNet is an effective and interpretable solution for multi-omics integration in cancer research.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 4 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

Current methods fail to achieve this balance: neural architectural search is computationally expensive, while model retrieval often yields suboptimal static checkpoints. To resolve this dilemma, we model the performance gains induced by fine-grained architectural modifications as edit-effect evidence and build evidence graphs from prior tasks. By constructing a retrieval-augmented model refinement framework, our proposed M-DESIGN dynamically weaves historical evidence to discover near-optimal modification paths. M-DESIGN features an adaptive retrieval mechanism that quickly calibrates the evolving transferability of edit-effect evidence from different sources. To handle out-of-distribution shifts, we introduce predictive task planners that extrapolate gains from multi-hop evidence, thereby reducing reliance on an exhaustive repository. Based on our model knowledge base of 67,760 graph neural networks across 22 datasets, extensive experiments demonstrate that M-DESIGN consistently outperforms baselines, achieving the search-space best performance in 26 out of 33 cases under a strict budget.</p></details> | <details><summary>Title...</summary><p>Title changed from "Beyond Model Base Selection: Weaving Knowledge to Master Fine-grained Neural Network Design" to "Beyond Model Base Retrieval: Weaving Knowledge to Master Fine-grained Neural Network Design"</p></details> |

However, the high dimensionality of multi-omics data, the heterogeneity across modalities, and the lack of reliable biological interaction networks make meaningful integration challenging. In addition, many existing models rely on handcrafted similarity graphs, are vulnerable to class imbalance, and often lack built-in interpretability, limiting their usefulness in biomedical applications. We propose Multi-Omics integration with Tree-generated Graph Neural Network (MOTGNN), a novel and interpretable framework for binary disease classification. MOTGNN employs eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) for omics-specific supervised graph construction, followed by modality-specific Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for hierarchical representation learning, and a deep feedforward network for cross-omics integration. Across three real-world disease datasets, MOTGNN outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by 5-10% in accuracy, ROC-AUC, and F1-score, and remains robust to severe class imbalance. The model maintains computational efficiency through the use of sparse graphs and provides built-in interpretability, revealing both top-ranked biomarkers and the relative contributions of each omics modality. These results highlight the potential of MOTGNN to improve both predictive accuracy and interpretability in multi-omics disease modeling.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 6 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |

However, LLMs, despite their general reasoning power, struggle significantly in specialized, data-sensitive tasks such as designing Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). This difficulty arises from (1) the inherent knowledge gaps in modeling the intricate, varying relationships between graph properties and suitable architectures and (2) the external noise from misleading descriptive inputs, often resulting in generic or even misleading model suggestions. Achieving proficiency in designing data-aware models -- defined as the meta-level capability to systematically accumulate, interpret, and apply data-specific design knowledge -- remains challenging for existing automated approaches, due to their inefficient construction and application of meta-knowledge. To achieve meta-level proficiency, we propose DesiGNN, a knowledge-centered framework that systematically converts past model design experience into structured, fine-grained knowledge priors well-suited for meta-learning with LLMs. To account for the inherent variability and external noise, DesiGNN aligns empirical property filtering from extensive benchmarks with adaptive elicitation of literature insights via LLMs. By constructing a solid meta-knowledge between unseen graph understanding and known effective architecture patterns, DesiGNN can deliver top-5.77% initial model proposals for unseen datasets within seconds and achieve consistently superior performance with minimal search cost compared to baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at WSDM 2026.

While multimodal content offers a promising solution, existing methods result in suboptimal representations for new items due to noise and entanglement in sparse data. To address this, we transform multimodal recommendation into discrete semantic tokenization. We present Sparse-Regularized Multimodal Tokenization for Cold-Start Recommendation (MoToRec), a framework centered on a sparsely-regularized Residual Quantized Variational Autoencoder (RQ-VAE) that generates a compositional semantic code of discrete, interpretable tokens, promoting disentangled representations. MoToRec's architecture is enhanced by three synergistic components: (1) a sparsely-regularized RQ-VAE that promotes disentangled representations, (2) a novel adaptive rarity amplification that promotes prioritized learning for cold-start items, and (3) a hierarchical multi-source graph encoder for robust signal fusion with collaborative signals. Extensive experiments on three large-scale datasets demonstrate MoToRec's superiority over state-of-the-art methods in both overall and cold-start scenarios. Our work validates that discrete tokenization provides an effective and scalable alternative for mitigating the long-standing cold-start challenge.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AAAI 2026 (Main Track)</p></details> |

Unlike pixel grids in images or sequential structures in language, graphs exhibit a typical non-Euclidean structure with complex interactions among the objects. This paper argues that Riemannian geometry provides a principled and necessary foundation for graph representation learning, and that Riemannian graph learning should be viewed as a unifying paradigm rather than a collection of isolated techniques. While recent studies have explored the integration of graph learning and Riemannian geometry, most existing approaches are limited to a narrow class of manifolds, particularly hyperbolic spaces, and often adopt extrinsic manifold formulations. We contend that the central mission of Riemannian graph learning is to endow graph neural networks with intrinsic manifold structures, which remains underexplored. To advance this perspective, we identify key conceptual and methodological gaps in existing approaches and outline a structured research agenda along three dimensions: manifold type, neural architecture, and learning paradigm. We further discuss open challenges, theoretical foundations, and promising directions that are critical for unlocking the full potential of Riemannian graph learning. This paper aims to provide a coherent viewpoint and to stimulate broader exploration of Riemannian geometry as a foundational framework for future graph learning research.</p></details> | <details><summary>34 pa...</summary><p>34 pages, 11 figures, position paper</p></details> |

We introduce the Intersecting Block Graph (IBG), a low-rank factorization of large directed graphs based on combinations of intersecting bipartite components, each consisting of a pair of communities, for source and target nodes. By giving less weight to non-edges, we show how to efficiently approximate any graph, sparse or dense, by a dense IBG. Specifically, we prove a constructive version of the weak regularity lemma, showing that for any chosen accuracy, every graph, regardless of its size or sparsity, can be approximated by a dense IBG whose rank depends only on the accuracy. This dependence of the rank solely on the accuracy, and not on the sparsity level, is in contrast to previous forms of the weak regularity lemma. We present a graph neural network architecture operating on the IBG representation of the graph and demonstrating competitive performance on node classification, spatio-temporal graph analysis, and knowledge graph completion, while having memory and computational complexity linear in the number of nodes rather than edges.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exponential time differencing for matrix-valued dynamical systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13761v2)** | 2026-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Matrix evolution equations occur in many applications, such as dynamical Lyapunov/Sylvester systems or Riccati equations in optimization and stochastic control, machine learning or data assimilation. In many such problems, the dominant stability restriction is imposed by a stiff linear term, making standard explicit integrators impractical. Exponential time differencing (ETD) is known to produce highly stable numerical schemes by treating the linear term in an exact fashion. In particular, for stiff problems, ETD methods are the methods of choice. We extend ETD to matrix-valued evolution equations of the form $\dot Q = LQ + QR + N(Q,t)$ by deriving explicit matrix-ETD (METD) schemes. When $L$ and $R$ commute, we construct an explicit $p$-th order METD$p$ family and prove order-$p$ global convergence under standard assumptions; for the non-commuting case, we develop a Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH)-based extension. This allows us to produce highly efficient and stable integration schemes. We demonstrate efficiency and applicability on stiff PDE-derived and large-scale matrix dynamics, including an Allen-Cahn system, turbulent jet fluctuation statistics, and continuous graph neural networks. We further show that the scheme is more accurate, stable, and efficient than competing schemes in large-scale high-rank stiff systems.</p></details> |  |

Using techniques from Network Science and Machine Learning, including Erdős-Rényi for model sparsification, we enhance the efficiency of GNNs for real-world applications. We demonstrate our approach on N-1 contingency assessment in electrical grids, a critical task for ensuring grid reliability. We apply our methods to three datasets of varying sizes, exploring Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) and Graph Isomorphism Networks (GIN) with different degrees of sparsification and rewiring. Comparison across sparsification levels shows the potential of combining insights from both research fields to improve GNN performance and scalability. Our experiments highlight the importance of tuning sparsity parameters: while sparsity can improve generalization, excessive sparsity may hinder learning of complex patterns. Our adaptive rewiring approach, particularly when combined with early stopping, proves promising by allowing the model to adapt its connectivity structure during training. This research contributes to understanding how sparsity can be effectively leveraged in GNNs for critical applications like power grid reliability analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |

Consequently, dimension-independent architectures have been proposed for domains where the inputs are graphs, sets, and point clouds. Recent work on graph neural networks has explored whether a model trained on low-dimensional data can transfer its performance to higher-dimensional inputs. We extend this body of work by introducing a general framework for transferability across dimensions. We show that transferability corresponds precisely to continuity in a limit space formed by identifying small problem instances with equivalent large ones. This identification is driven by the data and the learning task. We instantiate our framework on existing architectures, and implement the necessary changes to ensure their transferability. Finally, we provide design principles for designing new transferable models.

Prior research has explored the modeling of user preferences through sequential interactions and the user-item interaction graph, utilizing advanced techniques such as graph neural networks and transformer-based architectures. However, these methods typically fall short in simultaneously accounting for the dynamic nature of graph topologies and the sequential pattern of interactions in user preference models. Moreover, they often fail to adequately capture the multiple user behavior boundaries during model optimization. To tackle these challenges, we introduce a boundary-aware Multi-Behavioral Dynamic Graph Transformer (MB-DGT) model that dynamically refines the graph structure to reflect the evolving patterns of user behaviors and interactions. Our model involves a transformer-based dynamic graph aggregator for user preference modeling, which assimilates the changing graph structure and the sequence of user behaviors. This integration yields a more comprehensive and dynamic representation of user preferences. For model optimization, we implement a user-specific multi-behavior loss function that delineates the interest boundaries among different behaviors, thereby enriching the personalized learning of user preferences. Comprehensive experiments across three datasets indicate that our model consistently delivers remarkable recommendation performance.</p></details> |  |

While universal approximation theorems establish that sufficiently large architectures can approximate arbitrary continuous functions if there are no restrictions on the weight values, we show that dense neural networks do not possess this universality. Our argument is based on a model compression approach, combining the weak regularity lemma with an interpretation of feedforward networks as message passing graph neural networks. We consider ReLU neural networks subject to natural constraints on weights and input and output dimensions, which model a notion of dense connectivity. Within this setting, we demonstrate the existence of Lipschitz continuous functions that cannot be approximated by such networks. This highlights intrinsic limitations of neural networks with dense layers and motivates the use of sparse connectivity as a necessary ingredient for achieving true universality.</p></details> |  |

This paper argues that this divide is mostly artificial, hindering progress in the field. We propose a viewpoint in which both MPNNs and spectral GNNs are understood as different parametrizations of permutation-equivariant operators acting on graph signals. From this perspective, many popular architectures are equivalent in expressive power, while genuine gaps arise only in specific regimes. We further argue that MPNNs and spectral GNNs offer complementary strengths. That is, MPNNs provide a natural language for discrete structure and expressivity analysis using tools from logic and graph isomorphism research, while the spectral perspective provides principled tools for understanding smoothing, bottlenecks, stability, and community structure. Overall, we posit that progress in graph learning will be accelerated by clearly understanding the key similarities and differences between these two types of GNNs, and by working towards unifying these perspectives within a common theoretical and conceptual framework rather than treating them as competing paradigms.</p></details> |  |

Incorporating social and demographic indicators reveals patterns of community vulnerability and improves understanding of outage risk during extreme conditions. Four machine learning models are evaluated, including Random Forest (RF), Graph Neural Network (GNN), Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). Experimental validation is performed on a large-scale dataset covering counties in the lower peninsula of Michigan.

Traditional bot mitigation techniques, including IP blacklists and CAPTCHA-based challenges, are increasingly ineffective or intrusive, as modern bots leverage proxies, botnets, and AI-assisted evasion strategies. This work proposes a non-intrusive graph-based bot detection framework for e-commerce that models user session behavior through a graph representation and applies an inductive graph neural network for classification. The approach captures both relational structure and behavioral semantics, enabling accurate identification of subtle automated activity that evades feature-based methods. Experiments on real-world e-commerce traffic demonstrate that the proposed inductive graph model outperforms a strong session-level multilayer perceptron baseline in terms of AUC and F1 score. Additional adversarial perturbation and cold-start simulations show that the model remains robust under moderate graph modifications and generalizes effectively to previously unseen sessions and URLs. The proposed framework is deployment-friendly, integrates with existing systems without client-side instrumentation, and supports real-time inference and incremental updates, making it suitable for practical e-commerce security deployments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Differentiable Tripartite Modularity for Clustering Heterogeneous Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09864v1)** | 2026-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Clustering heterogeneous relational data remains a central challenge in graph learning, particularly when interactions involve more than two types of entities. While differentiable modularity objectives such as DMoN have enabled end-to-end community detection on homogeneous and bipartite graphs, extending these approaches to higher-order relational structures remains non-trivial. In this work, we introduce a differentiable formulation of tripartite modularity for graphs composed of three node types connected through mediated interactions. Community structure is defined in terms of weighted co-paths across the tripartite graph, together with an exact factorized computation that avoids the explicit construction of dense third-order tensors. A structural normalization at pivot nodes is introduced to control extreme degree heterogeneity and ensure stable optimization. The resulting objective can be optimized jointly with a graph neural network in an end-to-end manner, while retaining linear complexity in the number of edges. We validate the proposed framework on large-scale urban cadastral data, where it exhibits robust convergence behavior and produces spatially coherent partitions. These results highlight differentiable tripartite modularity as a generic methodological building block for unsupervised clustering of heterogeneous graphs.</p></details> | 12 pages, 3 figures |

Knowledge Base Question Answering (KBQA), which queries and reasons over KGs, is central to this effort, especially for complex, multi-hop queries. However, multi-hop reasoning poses two key challenges: (1)~maintaining coherent reasoning paths, and (2)~avoiding prematurely discarding critical multi-hop connections. To tackle these challenges, we introduce iQUEST, a question-guided KBQA framework that iteratively decomposes complex queries into simpler sub-questions, ensuring a structured and focused reasoning trajectory. Additionally, we integrate a Graph Neural Network (GNN) to look ahead and incorporate 2-hop neighbor information at each reasoning step. This dual approach strengthens the reasoning process, enabling the model to explore viable paths more effectively. Detailed experiments demonstrate the consistent improvement delivered by iQUEST across four benchmark datasets and four LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the 63rd Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL 2025), Main Track</p></details> |
| **[BRAVA-GNN: Betweenness Ranking Approximation Via Degree MAss Inspired Graph Neural Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09716v1)** | 2026-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Computing node importance in networks is a long-standing fundamental problem that has driven extensive study of various centrality measures. A particularly well-known centrality measure is betweenness centrality, which becomes computationally prohibitive on large-scale networks. Graph Neural Network (GNN) models have thus been proposed to predict node rankings according to their relative betweenness centrality. However, state-of-the-art methods fail to generalize to high-diameter graphs such as road networks. We propose BRAVA-GNN, a lightweight GNN architecture that leverages the empirically observed correlation linking betweenness centrality to degree-based quantities, in particular multi-hop degree mass. This correlation motivates the use of degree masses as size-invariant node features and synthetic training graphs that closely match the degree distributions of real networks. Furthermore, while previous work relies on scale-free synthetic graphs, we leverage the hyperbolic random graph model, which reproduces power-law exponents outside the scale-free regime, better capturing the structure of real-world graphs like road networks. This design enables BRAVA-GNN to generalize across diverse graph families while using 54x fewer parameters than the most lightweight existing GNN baseline. Extensive experiments on 19 real-world networks, spanning social, web, email, and road graphs, show that BRAVA-GNN achieves up to 214% improvement in Kendall-Tau correlation and up to 70x speedup in inference time over state-of-the-art GNN-based approaches, particularly on challenging road networks.</p></details> | Submitted to KDD |
| **[Scalable and Reliable State-Aware Inference of High-Impact N-k Contingencies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09461v1)** | 2026-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Increasing penetration of inverter-based resources, flexible loads, and rapidly changing operating conditions make higher-order $N\!-\!k$ contingency assessment increasingly important but computationally prohibitive. Exhaustive evaluation of all outage combinations using AC power-flow or ACOPF is infeasible in routine operation. This fact forces operators to rely on heuristic screening methods whose ability to consistently retain all critical contingencies is not formally established. This paper proposes a scalable, state-aware contingency inference framework designed to directly generate high-impact $N\!-\!k$ outage scenarios without enumerating the combinatorial contingency space. The framework employs a conditional diffusion model to produce candidate contingencies tailored to the current operating state, while a topology-aware graph neural network trained only on base and $N\!-\!1$ cases efficiently constructs high-risk training samples offline. Finally, the framework is developed to provide controllable coverage guarantees for severe contingencies, allowing operators to explicitly manage the risk of missing critical events under limited AC power-flow evaluation budgets. Experiments on IEEE benchmark systems show that, for a given evaluation budget, the proposed approach consistently evaluates higher-severity contingencies than uniform sampling. This allows critical outages to be identified more reliably with reduced computational effort.</p></details> |  |

This work proposes a multimodal graph neural network framework that integrates structural MRI, diffusion tensor imaging, and functional MRI to model spatiotemporal brain network reorganization. Brain regions are represented as nodes and structural and functional connectivity as edges, forming longitudinal brain graphs for each subject. Temporal evolution is captured via fractional stochastic differential operators embedded within graph-based recurrent networks, enabling the modeling of long-term dependencies and stochastic fluctuations in network dynamics. Attention mechanisms fuse multimodal information and generate interpretable biomarkers, including network energy entropy, graph curvature, fractional memory indices, and modality-specific attention scores. These biomarkers are combined into a composite prognostic index to quantify individual risk of network instability or cognitive decline. Experiments on longitudinal neuroimaging datasets demonstrate both predictive accuracy and interpretability. The results highlight the potential of mathematically rigorous, multimodal graph-based approaches for deriving clinically meaningful biomarkers from existing imaging data without requiring new data collection.</p></details> | <details><summary>Funda...</summary><p>Fundamental methodological error invalidating results</p></details> |

In this paper, we propose Exact subgraph Isomorphism Network (EIN), which combines the exact subgraph enumeration, a neural network, and a sparse regularization by the mixed $L_{0,2}$ norm constraint. In general, building a graph-level prediction model achieving high discriminative ability along with interpretability is still a challenging problem. Our combination of the subgraph enumeration and neural network contributes to high discriminative ability about the subgraph structure of the input graph. Further, the sparse regularization in EIN enables us 1) to derive an effective pruning strategy that mitigates computational difficulty of the enumeration while maintaining the prediction performance, and 2) to identify important subgraphs that contributes to high interpretability. We empirically show that EIN has sufficiently high prediction performance compared with standard graph neural network models, and also, we show examples of post-hoc analysis based on the selected subgraphs.</p></details> |  |

Existing graph domain adaptation (graph DA) methods often implicitly assume a mild shift between source and target graphs, limiting their applicability to real-world scenarios with large shifts. Gradual domain adaptation (GDA) has emerged as a promising approach for addressing large shifts by gradually adapting the source model to the target domain via a path of unlabeled intermediate domains. Existing GDA methods exclusively focus on independent and identically distributed (IID) data with a predefined path, leaving their extension to non-IID graphs without a given path an open challenge. To bridge this gap, we present Gadget, the first GDA framework for non-IID graph data. First (theoretical foundation), the Fused Gromov-Wasserstein (FGW) distance is adopted as the domain discrepancy for non-IID graphs, based on which, we derive an error bound on node, edge and graph-level tasks, showing that the target domain error is proportional to the length of the path. Second (optimal path), guided by the error bound, we identify the FGW geodesic as the optimal path, which can be efficiently generated by our proposed algorithm. The generated path can be seamlessly integrated with existing graph DA methods to handle large shifts on graphs, improving state-of-the-art graph DA methods by up to 6.8% in accuracy on real-world datasets.</p></details> | 35 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Generalizing GNNs with Tokenized Mixture of Experts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09258v1)** | 2026-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deployed graph neural networks (GNNs) are frozen at deployment yet must fit clean data, generalize under distribution shifts, and remain stable to perturbations. We show that static inference induces a fundamental tradeoff: improving stability requires reducing reliance on shift-sensitive features, leaving an irreducible worst-case generalization floor. Instance-conditional routing can break this ceiling, but is fragile because shifts can mislead routing and perturbations can make routing fluctuate. We capture these effects via two decompositions separating coverage vs selection, and base sensitivity vs fluctuation amplification. Based on these insights, we propose STEM-GNN, a pretrain-then-finetune framework with a mixture-of-experts encoder for diverse computation paths, a vector-quantized token interface to stabilize encoder-to-head signals, and a Lipschitz-regularized head to bound output amplification. Across nine node, link, and graph benchmarks, STEM-GNN achieves a stronger three-way balance, improving robustness to degree/homophily shifts and to feature/edge corruptions while remaining competitive on clean graphs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Graph...</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks, Generalization, Mixture of Experts</p></details> |

In this work, we focus on a prevalent yet under-explored phenomenon in graph generalization, Minimal Shift Flip (MSF),where test samples that slightly deviate from the training distribution are abruptly misclassified. To interpret this phenomenon, we revisit MSF through the lens of Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM), which characterizes the local stability and sharpness of the loss landscape while providing a theoretical foundation for modeling generalization error. To quantify loss sharpness, we introduce the concept of Local Robust Radius, measuring the smallest perturbation required to flip a prediction and establishing a theoretical link between local stability and generalization. Building on this perspective, we further observe a continual decrease in the robust radius during training, indicating weakened local stability and an increasingly sharp loss landscape that gives rise to MSF. To jointly solve the MSF phenomenon and the intractability of radius, we develop an energy-based formulation that is theoretically proven to be monotonically correlated with the robust radius, offering a tractable and principled objective for modeling flatness and stability. Building on these insights, we propose an energy-driven generative augmentation framework (E2A) that leverages energy-guided latent perturbations to generate pseudo-OOD samples and enhance model generalization. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that E2A consistently improves graph OOD generalization, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Graphop Analysis of Graph Neural Networks on Sparse Graphs: Generalization and Universal Approximation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08785v1)** | 2026-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generalization and approximation capabilities of message passing graph neural networks (MPNNs) are often studied by defining a compact metric on a space of input graphs under which MPNNs are Hölder continuous. Such analyses are of two varieties: 1) when the metric space includes graphs of unbounded sizes, the theory is only appropriate for dense graphs, and, 2) when studying sparse graphs, the metric space only includes graphs of uniformly bounded size. In this work, we present a unified approach, defining a compact metric on the space of graphs of all sizes, both sparse and dense, under which MPNNs are Hölder continuous. This leads to more powerful universal approximation theorems and generalization bounds than previous works. The theory is based on, and extends, a recent approach to graph limit theory called graphop analysis.</p></details> |  |
| **[HoGS: Homophily-Oriented Graph Synthesis for Local Differentially Private GNN Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08762v1)** | 2026-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in various graph-based machine learning tasks by effectively modeling high-order interactions between nodes. However, training GNNs without protection may leak sensitive personal information in graph data, including links and node features. Local differential privacy (LDP) is an advanced technique for protecting data privacy in decentralized networks. Unfortunately, existing local differentially private GNNs either only preserve link privacy or suffer significant utility loss in the process of preserving link and node feature privacy. In this paper, we propose an effective LDP framework, called HoGS, which trains GNNs with link and feature protection by generating a synthetic graph. Concretely, HoGS first collects the link and feature information of the graph under LDP, and then utilizes the phenomenon of homophily in graph data to reconstruct the graph structure and node features separately, thereby effectively mitigating the negative impact of LDP on the downstream GNN training. We theoretically analyze the privacy guarantee of HoGS and conduct experiments using the generated synthetic graph as input to various state-of-the-art GNN architectures. Experimental results on three real-world datasets show that HoGS significantly outperforms baseline methods in the accuracy of training GNNs.</p></details> |  |

Graph Neural Networks have emerged as the main architecture for SAT solving, due to the natural graph representation of Boolean formulas. We analyze the expressive power of GNNs for SAT solving through the lens of the Weisfeiler-Leman (WL) test. As our main result, we prove that the full WL hierarchy cannot, in general, distinguish between satisfiable and unsatisfiable instances. We show that indistinguishability under higher-order WL carries over to practical limitations for WL-bounded solvers that set variables sequentially. We further study the expressivity required for several important families of SAT instances, including regular, random and planar instances. To quantify expressivity needs in practice, we conduct experiments on random instances from the G4SAT benchmark and industrial instances from the International SAT Competition. Our results suggest that while random instances are largely distinguishable, industrial instances often require more expressivity to predict a satisfying assignment.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICLR 2026</p></details> |

However, the continuous growth of their data scale poses a significant computational bottleneck for training. Graph condensation methods provide a feasible path forward by synthesizing compact and representative datasets. Nevertheless, existing condensation approaches generally suffer from performance limitations in multimodal scenarios, mainly due to two reasons: (1) semantic misalignment between different modalities leads to gradient conflicts; (2) the message-passing mechanism of graph neural networks further structurally amplifies such gradient noise. Based on this, we propose Structural Regularized Gradient Matching (SR-GM), a condensation framework for multimodal graphs. This method alleviates gradient conflicts between modalities through a gradient decoupling mechanism and introduces a structural damping regularizer to suppress the propagation of gradient noise in the topology, thereby transforming the graph structure from a noise amplifier into a training stabilizer. Extensive experiments on four multimodal graph datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of SR-GM, highlighting its state-of-the-art performance and cross-architecture generalization capabilities in multimodal graph dataset condensation.</p></details> | <details><summary>12pag...</summary><p>12pages,7 figures,8 tables</p></details> |

The Graph Neural Network is designed to encapsulate general domain knowledge to improve schedule quality, while the Genetic Algorithm explores different regions of the search space and integrates the deep learning model as an enhancement operator to guide the solution search towards optimality. Initially, both components of the hybrid technique were designed, developed, and optimized independently to solve the tackled task. Multiple experiments were conducted on Staff Rostering, a well-known timetabling problem, to compare the proposed hybridization with the standalone optimized versions of the Genetic Algorithm and Graph Neural Network. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed hybridization brings statistically significant improvements in both the time efficiency and solution quality metrics, compared to the standalone methods. To the best of our knowledge, this work proposes the first hybridization of a Genetic Algorithm with a Graph Neural Network for solving timetabling problems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper accepted to the International Conference on Applications of Evolutionary Computation (EvoApplications) 2026</p></details> |
| **[TFMLinker: Universal Link Predictor by Graph In-Context Learning with Tabular Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08592v1)** | 2026-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Link prediction is a fundamental task in graph machine learning with widespread applications such as recommendation systems, drug discovery, knowledge graphs, etc. In the foundation model era, how to develop universal link prediction methods across datasets and domains becomes a key problem, with some initial attempts adopting Graph Foundation Models utilizing Graph Neural Networks and Large Language Models. However, the existing methods face notable limitations, including limited pre-training scale or heavy reliance on textual information. Motivated by the success of tabular foundation models (TFMs) in achieving universal prediction across diverse tabular datasets, we explore an alternative approach by TFMs, which are pre-trained on diverse synthetic datasets sampled from structural causal models and support strong in-context learning independent of textual attributes. Nevertheless, adapting TFMs for link prediction faces severe technical challenges such as how to obtain the necessary context and capture link-centric topological information. To solve these challenges, we propose TFMLinker (Tabular Foundation Model for Link Predictor), aiming to leverage the in-context learning capabilities of TFMs to perform link prediction across diverse graphs without requiring dataset-specific fine-tuning. Specifically, we first develop a prototype-augmented local-global context module to construct context that captures both graph-specific and cross-graph transferable patterns. Next, we design a universal topology-aware link encoder to capture link-centric topological information and generate link representations as inputs for the TFM. Finally, we employ the TFM to predict link existence through in-context learning. Experiments on 6 graph benchmarks across diverse domains demonstrate the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art baselines without requiring dataset-specific finetuning.</p></details> |  |

Evidence of Alignment and Decoupling in Heterogeneous GNNs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08500v1)** | 2026-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Meta-path-based heterogeneous graph neural networks aggregate over meta-path-induced views, and their semantic-level attention over meta-path channels is widely used as a narrative for ``which semantics matter.'' We study this assumption empirically by asking: when does meta-path attention reflect meta-path importance, and when can it decouple? A key challenge is that most post-hoc GNN explainers are designed for homogeneous graphs, and naive adaptations to heterogeneous neighborhoods can mix semantics and confound perturbations. To enable a controlled empirical analysis, we introduce MetaXplain, a meta-path-aware post-hoc explanation protocol that applies existing explainers in the native meta-path view domain via (i) view-factorized explanations, (ii) schema-valid channel-wise perturbations, and (iii) fusion-aware attribution, without modifying the underlying predictor. We benchmark representative gradient-, perturbation-, and Shapley-style explainers on ACM, DBLP, and IMDB with HAN and HAN-GCN, comparing against xPath and type-matched random baselines under standard faithfulness metrics. To quantify attention reliability, we propose Meta-Path Attention--Explanation Alignment (MP-AEA), which measures rank correlation between learned attention weights and explanation-derived meta-path contribution scores across random runs. Our results show that meta-path-aware explanations typically outperform random controls, while MP-AEA reveals both high-alignment and statistically significant decoupling regimes depending on the dataset and backbone; moreover, retraining on explanation-induced subgraphs often preserves, and in some noisy regimes improves, predictive performance, suggesting an explanation-as-denoising effect.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Graph Knowledge Distillation from GNNs to Kolmogorov--Arnold Networks via Self-Attention Dynamic Sampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00560v2)** | 2026-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent success of graph neural networks (GNNs) in modeling complex graph-structured data has fueled interest in deploying them on resource-constrained edge devices. However, their substantial computational and memory demands present ongoing challenges. Knowledge distillation (KD) from GNNs to MLPs offers a lightweight alternative, but MLPs remain limited by fixed activations and the absence of neighborhood aggregation, constraining distilled performance. To tackle these intertwined limitations, we propose SA-DSD, a novel self-attention-guided dynamic sampling distillation framework. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to employ an enhanced Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) as the student model. We improve Fourier KAN (FR-KAN+) with learnable frequency bases, phase shifts, and optimized algorithms, substantially improving nonlinear fitting capability over MLPs while preserving low computational complexity. To explicitly compensate for the absence of neighborhood aggregation that is inherent to both MLPs and KAN-based students, SA-DSD leverages a self-attention mechanism to dynamically identify influential nodes, construct adaptive sampling probability matrices, and enforce teacher-student prediction consistency. Extensive experiments on six real world datasets demonstrate that, under inductive and most of transductive settings, SA-DSD surpasses three GNN teachers by 3.05%-3.62% and improves FR-KAN+ by 15.61%. Moreover, it achieves a 16.69x parameter reduction and a 55.75% decrease in average runtime per epoch compared to key benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

We train them to predict spatial position of points in a discrete 2D grid from a set of constraints that uniquely describe hidden figures containing these points. Both models are able to predict the position of points and interestingly, they form the hidden figures described by the input constraints in the embedding space during the reasoning process. Our analysis shows that both models recover the grid structure during training so that the embeddings corresponding to the points within the grid organize themselves in a 2D subspace and reflect the neighborhood structure of the grid. We also show that the Graph Neural Network we design for the task performs significantly better than the Transformer and is also easier to scale.</p></details> |  |

First, YOLO 11x detects and crops human portraits frame-by-frame, and DINOv2-Base extracts visual features from the cropped regions. Next, by integrating Chain-of-Thought and Reflection prompting (CoT + Reflection), Gemini 2.5 Pro automatically generates pseudo-labels and reasoning texts that serve as weak supervision for downstream models. Subsequently, OpenPose produces 137-dimensional key-point sequences, augmented with inter-frame offset features; the usual graph neural network backbone is simplified to an MLP to efficiently model the spatiotemporal relationships of the three key-point streams. An ultra-long-sequence Transformer independently encodes both the image and key-point sequences, and their representations are concatenated with BERT-encoded interview transcripts. Each modality is first pre-trained in isolation, then fine-tuned jointly, with pseudo-labeled samples merged into the training set for further gains. Experiments demonstrate that, despite severe class imbalance, the proposed approach lifts accuracy from under 0.6 in prior work to over 0.69, establishing a new public benchmark. The study also validates that an "MLP-ified" key-point backbone can match - or even surpass - GCN-based counterparts in this task.</p></details> |  |

The GNN effectively represents the complex state of jobs, machines, and setups, allowing the PPO agent to learn a direct scheduling policy. Guided by a multi-objective reward function, the agent simultaneously minimizes TWT and TST. Experimental results on benchmark instances demonstrate that our PPO-GNN agent significantly outperforms a standard dispatching rule and a metaheuristic, achieving a superior trade-off between both objectives. This provides a robust and scalable solution for complex manufacturing scheduling.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 2 figures, Winter Simulation Conference (WSC) 2025</p></details> |

Most existing methods enforce physical validity through soft penalties, creating an intrinsic trade-off between geometric feasibility and physical plausibility: penalizing collisions often distorts mesh structure, while preserving shape leads to interpenetration. To resolve this conflict, we present PhysDrape, a hybrid neural-physical solver for physically realistic garment draping driven by explicit forces and constraints. Unlike soft-constrained frameworks, PhysDrape integrates neural inference with explicit geometric solvers in a fully differentiable pipeline. Specifically, we propose a Physics-Informed Graph Neural Network conditioned on a physics-enriched graph -- encoding material parameters and body proximity -- to predict residual displacements. Crucially, we integrate a differentiable two-stage solver: first, a learnable Force Solver iteratively resolves unbalanced forces derived from the Saint Venant-Kirchhoff (StVK) model to ensure quasi-static equilibrium; second, a Differentiable Projection strictly enforces collision constraints against the body surface. This differentiable design guarantees physical validity through explicit constraints, while enabling end-to-end learning to optimize the network for physically consistent predictions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PhysDrape achieves state-of-the-art performance, ensuring negligible interpenetration with significantly lower strain energy compared to existing baselines, achieving superior physical fidelity and robustness in real-time.</p></details> |  |

While graph neural networks (GNNs) excel at modeling topological information, they lack the capacity to process unstructured text. Conversely, large language models (LLMs) are proficient in text understanding but are typically unaware of graph structure. In this work, we propose BiGTex (Bidirectional Graph Text), a novel architecture that tightly integrates GNNs and LLMs through stacked Graph-Text Fusion Units. Each unit allows for mutual attention between textual and structural representations, enabling information to flow in both directions, text influencing structure and structure guiding textual interpretation. The proposed architecture is trained using parameter-efficient fine-tuning (LoRA), keeping the LLM frozen while adapting to task-specific signals. Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets demonstrate that BiGTex achieves state-of-the-art performance in node classification and generalizes effectively to link prediction. An ablation study further highlights the importance of soft prompting and bi-directional attention in the model's success.</p></details> | 26 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Learning Geometric-Aware Quadrature Rules for Functional Minimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05445v2)** | 2026-02-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate numerical integration over non-uniform point clouds is a challenge for modern mesh-free machine learning solvers for partial differential equations (PDEs) using variational principles. While standard Monte Carlo (MC) methods are not capable of handling a non-uniform point cloud, modern neural network architectures can deal with permutation-invariant inputs, creating quadrature rules for any point cloud. In this work, we introduce QuadrANN, a Graph Neural Network (GNN) architecture designed to learn optimal quadrature weights directly from the underlying geometry of point clouds. The design of the model exploits a deep message-passing scheme where the initial layer encodes rich local geometric features from absolute and relative positions as well as an explicit local density measure. In contrast, the following layers incorporate a global context vector. These architectural choices allow the QuadrANN to generate a data-driven quadrature rule that is permutation-invariant and adaptive to both local point density and the overall domain shape. We test our methodology on a series of challenging test cases, including integration on convex and non-convex domains and estimating the solution of the Heat and Fokker-Planck equations. Across all the tests, QuadrANN reduces the variance of the integral estimation compared to standard Quasi-Monte Carlo methods by warping the point clouds to be more dense in critical areas where the integrands present certain singularities. This enhanced stability in critical areas of the domain at hand is critical for the optimization of energy functionals, leading to improved deep learning-based variational solvers.</p></details> | 17 pages, 5 figures |

This gap yields explanations that may appear faithful yet be unreliable in practice. To this end, we propose LogicXGNN, a post-hoc framework that constructs logical rules over reliable predicates explicitly designed to capture the GNN's message-passing structure, thereby ensuring effective grounding. We further introduce data-grounded fidelity ($\textit{Fid}_{\mathcal{D}}$), a realistic metric that evaluates explanations in their final-graph form, along with complementary utility metrics such as coverage and validity. Across extensive experiments, LogicXGNN improves $\textit{Fid}_{\mathcal{D}}$ by over 20% on average relative to state-of-the-art methods while being 10-100 $\times$ faster. With strong scalability and utility performance, LogicXGNN produces explanations that are faithful to the model's logic and reliably grounded in observable data.

However, existing DONNs and other physics-based neural networks have mostly focused on exploring their machine intelligence, with limited studies in handling graph-structured tasks. Thus, we introduce HoloGraph, the first monolithic free-space all-optical graph neural network system. It proposes a novel, domain-specific message-passing mechanism with optical skip channels integrated into light propagation for the all-optical graph learning. HoloGraph enables light-speed optical message passing over graph structures with diffractive propagation and phase modulations.

| **[Quantifying Explanation Quality in Graph Neural Networks using Out-of-Distribution Generalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07708v1)** | 2026-02-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Evaluating the quality of post-hoc explanations for Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) remains a significant challenge. While recent years have seen an increasing development of explainability methods, current evaluation metrics (e.g., fidelity, sparsity) often fail to assess whether an explanation identifies the true underlying causal variables. To address this, we propose the Explanation-Generalization Score (EGS), a metric that quantifies the causal relevance of GNN explanations. EGS is founded on the principle of feature invariance and posits that if an explanation captures true causal drivers, it should lead to stable predictions across distribution shifts. To quantify this, we introduce a framework that trains GNNs using explanatory subgraphs and evaluates their performance in Out-of-Distribution (OOD) settings (here, OOD generalization serves as a rigorous proxy for the explanation's causal validity). Through large-scale validation involving 11,200 model combinations across synthetic and real-world datasets, our results demonstrate that EGS provides a principled benchmark for ranking explainers based on their ability to capture causal substructures, offering a robust alternative to traditional fidelity-based metrics.</p></details> |  |
| **[CaPGNN: Optimizing Parallel Graph Neural Network Training with Joint Caching and Resource-Aware Graph Partitioning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13716v2)** | 2026-02-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph-structured data is ubiquitous in the real world, and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become increasingly popular in various fields due to their ability to process such irregular data directly. However, as data scale, GNNs become inefficient. Although parallel training offers performance improvements, increased communication costs often offset these advantages. To address this, this paper introduces CaPGNN, a novel parallel full-batch GNN training framework on single-server with multi-GPU. Firstly, considering the fact that the number of remote vertices in a partition is often greater than or equal to the number of local vertices and there may exist many duplicate vertices, we propose a joint adaptive caching algorithm that leverages both CPU and GPU memory, integrating lightweight cache update and prefetch techniques to effectively reduce redundant communication costs. Furthermore, taking into account the varying computational and communication capabilities among GPUs, we propose a communication- and computation-aware heuristic graph partitioning algorithm inspired by graph sparsification. Additionally, we implement a pipeline to overlap computation and communication. Extensive experiments show that CaPGNN improves training efficiency by up to 18.98x and reduces communication costs by up to 99%, with minimal accuracy loss or even accuracy improvement in some cases. Finally, we extend CaPGNN to multi-machine multi-GPU environments. The code is available at https://github.com/songxf1024/CaPGNN.</p></details> |  |

Motivated by discrete physics losses and Hierarchical Deep Learning Neural Network (HiDeNN) constructions, we embed finite-element (FEM) computations at nodes and Gauss points directly into message-passing layers and propose a numerically consistent FEM-Informed Hypergraph Neural Networks (FHGNN). Similar to conventional physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), training is purely physics-driven and requires no labeled data: the input is a node element hypergraph whose edges encode mesh connectivity. Guided by empirical results and condition-number analysis, we adopt an efficient variational loss. Validated on 3D benchmarks, including cyclic loading with isotropic/kinematic hardening, the proposed method delivers substantially improved accuracy and efficiency over recent, competitive PINN variants. By leveraging GPU-parallel tensor operations and the discrete representation, it scales effectively to large elastoplastic problems and can be competitive with, or faster than, multi-core FEM implementations at comparable accuracy. This work establishes a foundation for scalable, physics-embedded learning in nonlinear solid mechanics.</p></details> | <details><summary>43 pa...</summary><p>43 pages, 26 figures, 8tables</p></details> |

In this article, we address task scheduling for lifelong Multi-Agent Pickup-and-Delivery (MAPD) and propose a hybrid method that couples learning-based global guidance with lightweight optimization. A graph neural network policy trained via reinforcement learning outputs a desired distribution of free agents over an aggregated warehouse graph. This signal is converted into region-to-region rebalancing through a minimum-cost flow, and finalized by small, local assignment problems, preserving accuracy while keeping per-step latency within a 1 s compute budget. On congested warehouse benchmarks from the League of Robot Runners (LoRR) with up to 500 agents, our approach improves throughput by up to 10% over the 2024 winning scheduler while maintaining real-time execution. The results indicate that coupling graph-structured learned guidance with tractable solvers reduces congestion and yields a practical, scalable blueprint for high-throughput scheduling in large fleets.</p></details> |  |

| **[Graph homophily booster: Reimagining the role of discrete features in heterophilic graph learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07256v1)** | 2026-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as a powerful tool for modeling graph-structured data. However, existing GNNs often struggle with heterophilic graphs, where connected nodes tend to have dissimilar features or labels. While numerous methods have been proposed to address this challenge, they primarily focus on architectural designs without directly targeting the root cause of the heterophily problem. These approaches still perform even worse than the simplest MLPs on challenging heterophilic datasets. For instance, our experiments show that 21 latest GNNs still fall behind the MLP on the Actor dataset. This critical challenge calls for an innovative approach to addressing graph heterophily beyond architectural designs. To bridge this gap, we propose and study a new and unexplored paradigm: directly increasing the graph homophily via a carefully designed graph transformation. In this work, we present a simple yet effective framework called GRAPHITE to address graph heterophily. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first method that explicitly transforms the graph to directly improve the graph homophily. Stemmed from the exact definition of homophily, our proposed GRAPHITE creates feature nodes to facilitate homophilic message passing between nodes that share similar features. Furthermore, we both theoretically and empirically show that our proposed GRAPHITE significantly increases the homophily of originally heterophilic graphs, with only a slight increase in the graph size. Extensive experiments on challenging datasets demonstrate that our proposed GRAPHITE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on heterophilic graphs while achieving comparable accuracy with state-of-the-art methods on homophilic graphs.</p></details> | ICLR 2026 |

While substantial progress has been made in single-table synthetic generation where data are modeled at the row or item level, most real-world data exists in relational databases where a user's information spans items across multiple interconnected tables. Recent advances in synthetic relational data generation have emerged to address this complexity, yet release of these data introduce unique privacy challenges as information can be leaked not only from individual items but also through the relationships that comprise a complete user entity. To address this, we propose a novel Membership Inference Attack (MIA) setting to audit the empirical user-level privacy of synthetic relational data and show that single-table MIAs that audit at an item level underestimate user-level privacy leakage. We then propose Multi-Table Membership Inference Attack (MT-MIA), a novel adversarial attack under a No-Box threat model that targets learned representations of user entities via Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks. By incorporating all connected items for a user, MT-MIA better targets user-level vulnerabilities induced by inter-tabular relationships than existing attacks. We evaluate MT-MIA on a range of real-world multi-table datasets and demonstrate that this vulnerability exists in state-of-the-art relational synthetic data generators, employing MT-MIA to additionally study where this leakage occurs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Interpreting Manifolds and Graph Neural Embeddings from Internet of Things Traffic Flows](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05817v2)** | 2026-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid expansion of Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystems has led to increasingly complex and heterogeneous network topologies. Traditional network monitoring and visualization tools rely on aggregated metrics or static representations, which fail to capture the evolving relationships and structural dependencies between devices. Although Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) offer a powerful way to learn from relational data, their internal representations often remain opaque and difficult to interpret for security-critical operations. Consequently, this work introduces an interpretable pipeline that generates directly visualizable low-dimensional representations by mapping high-dimensional embeddings onto a latent manifold. This projection enables the interpretable monitoring and interoperability of evolving network states, while integrated feature attribution techniques decode the specific characteristics shaping the manifold structure. The framework achieves a classification F1-score of 0.830 for intrusion detection while also highlighting phenomena such as concept drift. Ultimately, the presented approach bridges the gap between high-dimensional GNN embeddings and human-understandable network behavior, offering new insights for network administrators and security analysts.</p></details> |  |

The planning objective is to find a best-effort solution that avoids all hard constraint regions while minimally traversing the least risky areas. Conventional methods often rely on pre-defined area costs, limiting generalizations. Further, the spatial continuity of navigation spaces makes it difficult to identify regions that are passable without overestimation. To overcome these challenges, we propose SuReNav, a superpixel graph-based constraint relaxation and navigation method that imitates human-like safe and efficient navigation. Our framework consists of three components: 1) superpixel graph map generation with regional constraints, 2) regional-constraint relaxation using graph neural network trained on human demonstrations for safe and efficient navigation, and 3) interleaving relaxation, planning, and execution for complete navigation. We evaluate our method against state-of-the-art baselines on 2D semantic maps and 3D maps from OpenStreetMap, achieving the highest human-likeness score of complete navigation while maintaining a balanced trade-off between efficiency and safety. We finally demonstrate its scalability and generalization performance in real-world urban navigation with a quadruped robot, Spot.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICRA 2026.

| **[Weisfeiler and Lehman Go Categorical](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06787v1)** | 2026-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While lifting map has significantly enhanced the expressivity of graph neural networks, extending this paradigm to hypergraphs remains fragmented. To address this, we introduce the categorical Weisfeiler-Lehman framework, which formalizes lifting as a functorial mapping from an arbitrary data category to the unifying category of graded posets. When applied to hypergraphs, this perspective allows us to systematically derive Hypergraph Isomorphism Networks, a family of neural architectures where the message passing topology is strictly determined by the choice of functor. We introduce two distinct functors from the category of hypergraphs: an incidence functor and a symmetric simplicial complex functor. While the incidence architecture structurally mirrors standard bipartite schemes, our functorial derivation enforces a richer information flow over the resulting poset, capturing complex intersection geometries often missed by existing methods. We theoretically characterize the expressivity of these models, proving that both the incidence-based and symmetric simplicial approaches subsume the expressive power of the standard Hypergraph Weisfeiler-Lehman test. Extensive experiments on real-world benchmarks validate these theoretical findings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Comme...</summary><p>Comments are welcome!</p></details> |

Solving MAPF optimally is known to be NP-hard, leading to the adoption of learning-based approaches to alleviate the online computational burden. Prevailing approaches, such as Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), are typically constrained to pairwise message passing between agents. However, this limitation leads to suboptimal behaviours and critical issues, such as attention dilution, particularly in dense environments where group (i.e. beyond just two agents) coordination is most critical. Despite the importance of such higher-order interactions, existing approaches have not been able to fully explore them. To address this representational bottleneck, we introduce HMAGAT (Hypergraph Multi-Agent Attention Network), a novel architecture that leverages attentional mechanisms over directed hypergraphs to explicitly capture group dynamics. Empirically, HMAGAT establishes a new state-of-the-art among learning-based MAPF solvers: e.g., despite having just 1M parameters and being trained on 100$\times$ less data, it outperforms the current SoTA 85M parameter model. Through detailed analysis of HMAGAT's attention values, we demonstrate how hypergraph representations mitigate the attention dilution inherent in GNNs and capture complex interactions where pairwise methods fail. Our results illustrate that appropriate inductive biases are often more critical than the training data size or sheer parameter count for multi-agent problems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICLR 2026</p></details> |

However, this solution is not foolproof. The involvement of multiple parties creates new attack surfaces, and residual traces of deleted data can still remain in the unlearned graph neural networks (GNNs). These vulnerabilities can be exploited by attackers to recover the supposedly erased samples, thereby undermining the intended functionality of graph unlearning. In this work, we propose GraphToxin, the first full graph reconstruction attack against graph unlearning. Specifically, we introduce a novel curvature matching module to provide fine-grained guidance for unlearned graph recovery. We demonstrate that GraphToxin can successfully subvert the regulatory guarantees expected from graph unlearning, it can recover not only a deleted individual's information and personal links but also sensitive content from their connections, thereby posing substantially more detrimental threats. Furthermore, we extend GraphToxin to multiple-node removal under both white-box and black-box settings, showcasing its practical feasibility and potential to cause considerable harm. We highlight the necessity of worst-case analysis and propose a systematic evaluation framework to assess attack performance under both random and worst-case node removal scenarios. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and flexibility of GraphToxin. Notably, existing defense mechanisms are largely ineffective against this attack or even amplify its performance in some cases. Given the severe privacy risks posed by GraphToxin, our work underscores the urgent need for more effective and robust defenses.</p></details> |  |
| **[Scaling Multi-Agent Epistemic Planning through GNN-Derived Heuristics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12840v4)** | 2026-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-agent Epistemic Planning (MEP) is an autonomous planning framework for reasoning about both the physical world and the beliefs of agents, with applications in domains where information flow and awareness among agents are critical. The richness of MEP requires states to be represented as Kripke structures, i.e., directed labeled graphs. This representation limits the applicability of existing heuristics, hindering the scalability of epistemic solvers, which must explore an exponential search space without guidance, resulting often in intractability. To address this, we exploit Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to learn patterns and relational structures within epistemic states, to guide the planning process. GNNs, which naturally capture the graph-like nature of Kripke models, allow us to derive meaningful estimates of state quality -- e.g., the distance from the nearest goal -- by generalizing knowledge obtained from previously solved planning instances. We integrate these predictive heuristics into an epistemic planning pipeline and evaluate them against standard baselines, showing improvements in the scalability of multi-agent epistemic planning.</p></details> |  |

The method is designed to guide the learning process through successive approximations, starting from reduced-order and full Stokes models, and progressively approaching the Navier--Stokes solution. To effectively capture both local and long-range dependencies in the velocity and pressure fields, we combine graph neural networks with Transformer and Mamba architectures. While Transformers achieve the highest accuracy, we show that Mamba can be successfully adapted to graph-structured data through an unsupervised node-ordering strategy. The Mamba approach significantly reduces computational cost while maintaining performance. Physical knowledge is embedded directly into the architecture through an encoding-processing-physics informed decoding pipeline. Derivatives are computed through algebraic operators constructed via the Weighted Least Squares method. The flexibility of these operators allows us not only to make the output obey the governing equations, but also to constrain selected hidden features to satisfy mass conservation. We introduce additional physical biases through an enriched graph convolution with the same differential operators describing the PDEs. Overall, we successfully guide the learning process by physical knowledge and fluid dynamics insights, leading to more regular and accurate predictions</p></details> |  |
| **[Which Graph Shift Operator? A Spectral Answer to an Empirical Question](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06557v1)** | 2026-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have established themselves as the leading models for learning on graph-structured data, generally categorized into spatial and spectral approaches. Central to these architectures is the Graph Shift Operator (GSO), a matrix representation of the graph structure used to filter node signals. However, selecting the optimal GSO, whether fixed or learnable, remains largely empirical. In this paper, we introduce a novel alignment gain metric that quantifies the geometric distortion between the input signal and label subspaces. Crucially, our theoretical analysis connects this alignment directly to generalization bounds via a spectral proxy for the Lipschitz constant. This yields a principled, computation-efficient criterion to rank and select the optimal GSO for any prediction task prior to training, eliminating the need for extensive search.</p></details> |  |

This study presents a comprehensive analysis of OSS contributor networks using advanced graph neural networks and temporal network analysis on data spanning 25 years from the Cloud Native Computing Foundation ecosystem, encompassing sandbox, incubating, and graduated projects. Our analysis of thousands of contributors across hundreds of repositories reveals that OSS networks exhibit strong power-law distributions in influence, with the top 1\% of contributors controlling a substantial portion of network influence. Using GPU-accelerated PageRank, betweenness centrality, and custom LSTM models, we identify five distinct contributor roles: Core, Bridge, Connector, Regular, and Peripheral, each with unique network positions and structural importance. Statistical analysis reveals significant correlations between specific action types (commits, pull requests, issues) and contributor influence, with multiple regression models explaining substantial variance in influence metrics. Temporal analysis shows that network density, clustering coefficients, and modularity exhibit statistically significant temporal trends, with distinct regime changes coinciding with major project milestones. Structural integrity simulations show that Bridge contributors, despite representing a small fraction of the network, have a disproportionate impact on network cohesion when removed. Our findings provide empirical evidence for strategic contributor retention policies and offer actionable insights into community health metrics.</p></details> |  |

The most effective way to prevent fraud is by contacting customers to verify suspicious transactions. However, while these systems are designed to detect fraudulent activity, they often mistakenly flag legitimate transactions, leading to unnecessary declines that disrupt the user experience and erode customer trust. Frequent false positives can frustrate customers, resulting in dissatisfaction, increased complaints, and a diminished sense of security. To address these limitations, we propose a fraud detection framework incorporating Relational Graph Convolutional Networks (RGCN) to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of identifying fraudulent transactions. By leveraging the relational structure of transaction data, our model reduces the need for direct customer confirmation while maintaining high detection performance. Our experiments are conducted using the IBM credit card transaction dataset to evaluate the effectiveness of this approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in Proceedings of the 2025 IEEE 7th International Conference on Communications, Information System and Computer Engineering (CISCE), pp. 320-324.

To address challenges arising from increased traffic and diverse network architectures, organizations employ automated tools for firewall rule and access policy generation. Yet, effectively managing risks arising from dynamically generated policies, especially concerning critical asset exposure, remains a major challenge. This challenge is amplified by evolving network structures due to trends like remote users, bring-your-own devices, and cloud integration. This paper introduces a novel graph neural network model for identifying weighted shortest paths. The model aids in detecting network misconfigurations and high-risk connectivity paths that threaten critical assets, potentially exploited in zero-day attacks -- cyber-attacks exploiting undisclosed vulnerabilities. The proposed Pro-ZD framework adopts a proactive approach, automatically fine-tuning firewall rules and access policies to address high-risk connections and prevent unauthorized access. Experimental results highlight the robustness and transferability of Pro-ZD, achieving over 95% average accuracy in detecting high-risk connections. \</p></details> |  |

In this work, we propose a novel framework, ATEX-CF that unifies adversarial attack techniques with counterfactual explanation generation-a connection made feasible by their shared goal of flipping a node's prediction, yet differing in perturbation strategy: adversarial attacks often rely on edge additions, while counterfactual methods typically use deletions. Unlike traditional approaches that treat explanation and attack separately, our method efficiently integrates both edge additions and deletions, grounded in theory, leveraging adversarial insights to explore impactful counterfactuals. In addition, by jointly optimizing fidelity, sparsity, and plausibility under a constrained perturbation budget, our method produces instance-level explanations that are both informative and realistic. Experiments on synthetic and real-world node classification benchmarks demonstrate that ATEX-CF generates faithful, concise, and plausible explanations, highlighting the effectiveness of integrating adversarial insights into counterfactual reasoning for GNNs.</p></details> | <details><summary>30 pa...</summary><p>30 pages, accepted by ICLR 2026, github code:https://github.com/zhangyuo/ATEX_CF</p></details> |

While Large Language Models (LLMs) can generate code from natural language queries, runtime code generation is severely limited due to unverified code, security risks, longer response times, and higher computational costs. To bridge the gap, we propose an offline simulation framework to curate a software-specific skillset, a collection of verified scripts, by exploiting LLMs and publicly available scripting guides. Our framework comprises two components: (1) task creation, using top-down functionality guidance and bottom-up API synergy exploration to generate helpful tasks; and (2) skill generation with trials, refining and validating scripts based on execution feedback. To efficiently navigate the extensive API landscape, we introduce a Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based link prediction model to capture API synergy, enabling the generation of skills involving underutilized APIs and expanding the skillset's diversity. Experiments with Adobe Illustrator demonstrate that our framework significantly improves automation success rates, reduces response time, and saves runtime token costs compared to traditional runtime code generation. This is the first attempt to use software scripting interfaces as a testbed for LLM-based systems, highlighting the advantages of leveraging execution feedback in a controlled environment and offering valuable insights into aligning AI capabilities with user needs in specialized software domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>Findi...</summary><p>Findings of the Association for Computational Linguistics: EACL 2026</p></details> |

Machine learning has become an invaluable tool for scaling physics-based simulators and developing models directly from experimental data. In particular, recent advances in deep generative modeling and geometric deep learning enable probabilistic simulation by learning complex trajectory distributions while respecting intrinsic permutation and time-shift symmetries. However, trajectories of N-body systems are commonly characterized by high sensitivity to perturbations leading to bifurcations, as well as multi-scale temporal and spatial correlations. To address these challenges, we introduce STFlow (Spatio-Temporal Flow), a generative model based on graph neural networks and hierarchical convolutions. By incorporating data-dependent couplings within the Flow Matching framework, STFlow denoises starting from conditioned random-walks instead of Gaussian noise. This novel informed prior simplifies the learning task by reducing transport cost, increasing training and inference efficiency. We validate our approach on N-body systems, molecular dynamics, and human trajectory forecasting. Across these benchmarks, STFlow achieves the lowest prediction errors with fewer simulation steps and improved scalability.</p></details> | 18 pages, 12 figures |
| **[Breaking Symmetry Bottlenecks in GNN Readouts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05950v1)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) are widely used for learning on structured data, yet their ability to distinguish non-isomorphic graphs is fundamentally limited. These limitations are usually attributed to message passing; in this work we show that an independent bottleneck arises at the readout stage. Using finite-dimensional representation theory, we prove that all linear permutation-invariant readouts, including sum and mean pooling, factor through the Reynolds (group-averaging) operator and therefore project node embeddings onto the fixed subspace of the permutation action, erasing all non-trivial symmetry-aware components regardless of encoder expressivity. This yields both a new expressivity barrier and an interpretable characterization of what global pooling preserves or destroys. To overcome this collapse, we introduce projector-based invariant readouts that decompose node representations into symmetry-aware channels and summarize them with nonlinear invariant statistics, preserving permutation invariance while retaining information provably invisible to averaging. Empirically, swapping only the readout enables fixed encoders to separate WL-hard graph pairs and improves performance across multiple benchmarks, demonstrating that readout design is a decisive and under-appreciated factor in GNN expressivity.</p></details> | 23 pages |

In this work, we study GNN robustness to label noise, demonstrate GNN failure modes when models struggle to generalise on low-order graphs, low label coverage, or when a model is over-parameterized. We establish both empirical and theoretical links between GNN robustness and the reduction of the total Dirichlet Energy of learned node representations, which encapsulates the hypothesized GNN smoothness inductive bias. Finally, we introduce two training strategies to enhance GNN robustness: (1) by incorporating a novel inductive bias in the weight matrices through the removal of negative eigenvalues, connected to Dirichlet Energy minimization; (2) by extending to GNNs a loss penalty that promotes learned smoothness. Importantly, neither approach negatively impacts performance in noise-free settings, supporting our hypothesis that the source of GNNs robustness is their smoothness inductive bias.</p></details> |  |

While graph neural networks (GNNs) are widely used to learn from such data, counterfactual graph learning has emerged as a promising approach to improve model interpretability. Counterfactual explanation research focuses on identifying a counterfactual graph that is similar to the original but leads to different predictions. These explanations optimize two objectives simultaneously: the sparsity of changes in the counterfactual graph and the validity of its predictions. Building on these qualitative optimization goals, this paper introduces CFRecs, a novel framework that transforms counterfactual explanations into actionable insights. CFRecs employs a two-stage architecture consisting of a graph neural network (GNN) and a graph variational auto-encoder (Graph-VAE) to strategically propose minimal yet high-impact changes in graph structure and node attributes to drive desirable outcomes in recommender systems. We apply CFRecs to Zillow's graph-structured data to deliver actionable recommendations for both home buyers and sellers with the goal of helping them navigate the competitive housing market and achieve their homeownership goals. Experimental results on Zillow's user-listing interaction data demonstrate the effectiveness of CFRecs, which also provides a fresh perspective on recommendations using counterfactual reasoning in graphs.</p></details> |  |

However, a significant data imbalance impedes progress: while spatial transcriptomics data is relatively abundant, spatial proteomics data remains scarce due to technical limitations and high costs. To overcome this challenge we propose STProtein, a novel framework leveraging graph neural networks with multi-task learning strategy. STProtein is designed to accurately predict unknown spatial protein expression using more accessible spatial multi-omics data, such as spatial transcriptomics. We believe that STProtein can effectively addresses the scarcity of spatial proteomics, accelerating the integration of spatial multi-omics and potentially catalyzing transformative breakthroughs in life sciences. This tool enables scientists to accelerate discovery by identifying complex and previously hidden spatial patterns of proteins within tissues, uncovering novel relationships between different marker genes, and exploring the biological "Dark Matter".</p></details> | <details><summary>STPro...</summary><p>STProtein: predicting spatial protein expression from multi-omics data is accepted SPARTA_AAAI2026 Oral GitHub: https://github.com/zhaorui-bi/STProtein</p></details> |

However, their asynchronous and sparse data format poses a significant challenge for conventional deep learning methods. Existing methods either convert the events into dense synchronous frame representations for processing by powerful CNNs or Transformers, but lose the asynchronous, sparse and high temporal resolution characteristics of events during the conversion process; or adopt irregular models such as sparse convolution, spiking neural networks, or graph neural networks to process the irregular event representations but fail to take full advantage of GPU acceleration. Inspired by word-to-vector models, we draw an analogy between words and events to introduce event2vec, a novel representation that allows neural networks to process events directly. This approach is fully compatible with the parallel processing capabilities of Transformers. We demonstrate the effectiveness of event2vec on the DVS Gesture, ASL-DVS, and DVS-Lip benchmarks, showing that event2vec is remarkably parameter-efficient, features high throughput and low latency, and achieves high accuracy even with an extremely low number of events or low spatial resolutions. Event2vec introduces a novel paradigm by demonstrating for the first time that sparse, irregular event data can be directly integrated into high-throughput Transformer architectures. This breakthrough resolves the long-standing conflict between maintaining data sparsity and maximizing GPU efficiency, offering a promising balance for real-time, low-latency neuromorphic vision tasks.

| **[Broken neural scaling laws in materials science](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05702v1)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In materials science, data are scarce and expensive to generate, whether computationally or experimentally. Therefore, it is crucial to identify how model performance scales with dataset size and model capacity to distinguish between data- and model-limited regimes. Neural scaling laws provide a framework for quantifying this behavior and guide the design of materials datasets and machine learning architectures. Here, we investigate neural scaling laws for a paradigmatic materials science task: predicting the dielectric function of metals, a high-dimensional response that governs how solids interact with light. Using over 200,000 dielectric functions from high-throughput ab initio calculations, we study two multi-objective graph neural networks trained to predict the frequency-dependent complex interband dielectric function and the Drude frequency. We observe broken neural scaling laws with respect to dataset size, whereas scaling with the number of model parameters follows a simple power law that rapidly saturates.</p></details> |  |
| **[EdgeMask-DG*: Learning Domain-Invariant Graph Structures via Adversarial Edge Masking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05571v1)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Structural shifts pose a significant challenge for graph neural networks, as graph topology acts as a covariate that can vary across domains. Existing domain generalization methods rely on fixed structural augmentations or training on globally perturbed graphs, mechanisms that do not pinpoint which specific edges encode domain-invariant information. We argue that domain-invariant structural information is not rigidly tied to a single topology but resides in the consensus across multiple graph structures derived from topology and feature similarity. To capture this, we first propose EdgeMask-DG, a novel min-max algorithm where an edge masker learns to find worst-case continuous masks subject to a sparsity constraint, compelling a task GNN to perform effectively under these adversarial structural perturbations. Building upon this, we introduce EdgeMask-DG*, an extension that applies this adversarial masking principle to an enriched graph. This enriched graph combines the original topology with feature-derived edges, allowing the model to discover invariances even when the original topology is noisy or domain-specific. EdgeMask-DG* is the first to systematically combine adaptive adversarial topology search with feature-enriched graphs. We provide a formal justification for our approach from a robust optimization perspective. We demonstrate that EdgeMask-DG* achieves new state-of-the-art performance on diverse graph domain generalization benchmarks, including citation networks, social networks, and temporal graphs. Notably, on the Cora OOD benchmark, EdgeMask-DG* lifts the worst-case domain accuracy to 78.0\%, a +3.8 pp improvement over the prior state of the art (74.2\%).

| **[MAGPrompt: Message-Adaptive Graph Prompt Tuning for Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05567v1)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pre-trained graph neural networks (GNNs) transfer well, but adapting them to downstream tasks remains challenging due to mismatches between pre-training objectives and task requirements. Graph prompt tuning offers a parameter-efficient alternative to fine-tuning, yet most methods only modify inputs or representations and leave message passing unchanged, limiting their ability to adapt neighborhood interactions. We propose message-adaptive graph prompt tuning, which injects learnable prompts into the message passing step to reweight incoming neighbor messages and add task-specific prompt vectors during message aggregation, while keeping the backbone GNN frozen. The approach is compatible with common GNN backbones and pre-training strategies, and applicable across downstream settings. Experiments on diverse node- and graph-level datasets show consistent gains over prior graph prompting methods in few-shot settings, while achieving performance competitive with fine-tuning in full-shot regimes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-View Adaptive Contrastive Learning for Information Retrieval Based Fault Localization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12519v3)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most studies focused on information retrieval-based techniques for fault localization, which built representations for bug reports and source code files and matched their semantic vectors through similarity measurement. However, such approaches often ignore some useful information that might help improve localization performance, such as 1) the interaction relationship between bug reports and source code files; 2) the similarity relationship between bug reports; and 3) the co-citation relationship between source code files. In this paper, we propose a novel approach named Multi-View Adaptive Contrastive Learning for Information Retrieval Fault Localization (MACL-IRFL) to learn the above-mentioned relationships for software fault localization. Specifically, we first generate data augmentations from report-code interaction view, report-report similarity view and code-code co-citation view separately, and adopt graph neural network to aggregate the information of bug reports or source code files from the three views in the embedding process. Moreover, we perform contrastive learning across these views. Our design of contrastive learning task will force the bug report representations to encode information shared by report-report and report-code views,and the source code file representations shared by code-code and report-code views, thereby alleviating the noise from auxiliary information. Finally, to evaluate the performance of our approach, we conduct extensive experiments on five open-source Java projects. The results show that our model can improve over the best baseline up to 28.93%, 25.57% and 20.35% on Accuracy@1, MAP and MRR, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper was accepted by Automated Software Engineering in 18 October 2025</p></details> |
| **[Smoothness Errors in Dynamics Models and How to Avoid Them](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05352v1)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern neural networks have shown promise for solving partial differential equations over surfaces, often by discretizing the surface as a mesh and learning with a mesh-aware graph neural network. However, graph neural networks suffer from oversmoothing, where a node's features become increasingly similar to those of its neighbors. Unitary graph convolutions, which are mathematically constrained to preserve smoothness, have been proposed to address this issue. Despite this, in many physical systems, such as diffusion processes, smoothness naturally increases and unitarity may be overconstraining. In this paper, we systematically study the smoothing effects of different GNNs for dynamics modeling and prove that unitary convolutions hurt performance for such tasks. We propose relaxed unitary convolutions that balance smoothness preservation with the natural smoothing required for physical systems. We also generalize unitary and relaxed unitary convolutions from graphs to meshes. In experiments on PDEs such as the heat and wave equations over complex meshes and on weather forecasting, we find that our method outperforms several strong baselines, including mesh-aware transformers and equivariant neural networks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Ecsta...</summary><p>Ecstatic to share relaxed unitary mesh convolutions with the community :D!

| **[Relational Graph Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10960v2)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Relational Deep Learning (RDL) is a promising approach for building state-of-the-art predictive models on multi-table relational data by representing it as a heterogeneous temporal graph. However, commonly used Graph Neural Network models suffer from fundamental limitations in capturing complex structural patterns and long-range dependencies that are inherent in relational data. While Graph Transformers have emerged as powerful alternatives to GNNs on general graphs, applying them to relational entity graphs presents unique challenges: (i) Traditional positional encodings fail to generalize to massive, heterogeneous graphs; (ii) existing architectures cannot model the temporal dynamics and schema constraints of relational data; (iii) existing tokenization schemes lose critical structural information. Here we introduce the Relational Graph Transformer (RelGT), the first graph transformer architecture designed specifically for relational tables. RelGT employs a novel multi-element tokenization strategy that decomposes each node into five components (features, type, hop distance, time, and local structure), enabling efficient encoding of heterogeneity, temporality, and topology without expensive precomputation. Our architecture combines local attention over sampled subgraphs with global attention to learnable centroids, incorporating both local and database-wide representations. Across 21 tasks from the RelBench benchmark, RelGT consistently matches or outperforms GNN baselines by up to 18%, establishing Graph Transformers as a powerful architecture for Relational Deep Learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2026, Code: https://github.com/snap-stanford/relgt</p></details> |
| **[Aspect-Aware MOOC Recommendation in a Heterogeneous Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05297v1)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>MOOC recommendation systems have received increasing attention to help learners navigate and select preferred learning content. Traditional methods such as collaborative filtering and content-based filtering suffer from data sparsity and over-specialization. To alleviate these limitations, graph-based approaches have been proposed; however, they still rely heavily on manually predefined metapaths, which often capture only superficial structural relationships and impose substantial burdens on domain experts as well as significant engineering costs. To overcome these limitations, we propose AMR (Aspect-aware MOOC Recommendation), a novel framework that models path-specific multiple aspects by embedding the semantic content of nodes within each metapath. AMR automatically discovers metapaths through bi-directional walks, derives aspect-aware path representations using a bi-LSTM-based encoder, and incorporates these representations as edge features in the learner-learner and KC-KC subgraphs to achieve fine-grained semantically informed KC recommendations. Extensive experiments on the large-scale MOOCCube and PEEK datasets show that AMR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art graph neural network baselines across key metrics such as HR@K and nDCG@K. Further analysis confirms that AMR effectively captures rich path-specific aspect information, allowing more accurate recommendations than those methods that rely solely on predefined metapaths. The code will be available upon accepted.</p></details> |  |

Despite recent advancements using graph neural networks (GNNs), two major challenges persist. At the model level, most methods adopt a transductive learning paradigm, which assumes static graph structures, making them unsuitable for dynamic, evolving networks. At the data level, the extreme class imbalance, where anomalous nodes are rare, leads to biased models that fail to generalize to unseen anomalies. These challenges are interdependent: static transductive frameworks limit effective data augmentation, while imbalance exacerbates model distortion in inductive learning settings. To address these challenges, we propose a novel data-centric framework that integrates dynamic graph modeling with balanced anomaly synthesis. Our framework features: (1) a discrete ego-graph diffusion model, which captures the local topology of anomalies to generate ego-graphs aligned with anomalous structural distribution, and (2) a curriculum anomaly augmentation mechanism, which dynamically adjusts synthetic data generation during training, focusing on underrepresented anomaly patterns to improve detection and generalization. Experiments on five datasets demonstrate that the effectiveness of our framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages,6 figures, Accepted by ACM SIGKDD Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (KDD '26)</p></details> |
| **[Graph Persistence goes Spectral](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06571v3)** | 2026-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Including intricate topological information (e.g., cycles) provably enhances the expressivity of message-passing graph neural networks (GNNs) beyond the Weisfeiler-Leman (WL) hierarchy. Consequently, Persistent Homology (PH) methods are increasingly employed for graph representation learning. In this context, recent works have proposed decorating classical PH diagrams with vertex and edge features for improved expressivity. However, these methods still fail to capture basic graph structural information. In this paper, we propose SpectRe -- a new topological descriptor for graphs that integrates spectral information into PH diagrams. Notably, SpectRe is strictly more expressive than PH and spectral information on graphs alone. We also introduce notions of global and local stability to analyze existing descriptors and establish that SpectRe is locally stable. Finally, experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of SpectRe and its potential to enhance the capabilities of graph models in relevant learning tasks.

| **[DMFlow: Disordered Materials Generation by Flow Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04734v1)** | 2026-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The design of materials with tailored properties is crucial for technological progress. However, most deep generative models focus exclusively on perfectly ordered crystals, neglecting the important class of disordered materials. To address this gap, we introduce DMFlow, a generative framework specifically designed for disordered crystals. Our approach introduces a unified representation for ordered, Substitutionally Disordered (SD), and Positionally Disordered (PD) crystals, and employs a flow matching model to jointly generate all structural components. A key innovation is a Riemannian flow matching framework with spherical reparameterization, which ensures physically valid disorder weights on the probability simplex. The vector field is learned by a novel Graph Neural Network (GNN) that incorporates physical symmetries and a specialized message-passing scheme. Finally, a two-stage discretization procedure converts the continuous weights into multi-hot atomic assignments. To support research in this area, we release a benchmark containing SD, PD, and mixed structures curated from the Crystallography Open Database. Experiments on Crystal Structure Prediction (CSP) and De Novo Generation (DNG) tasks demonstrate that DMFlow significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines adapted from ordered crystal generation. We hope our work provides a foundation for the AI-driven discovery of disordered materials.</p></details> |  |
| **[Discrete Diffusion-Based Model-Level Explanation of Heterogeneous GNNs with Node Features](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08458v2)** | 2026-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many real-world datasets, such as citation networks, social networks, and molecular structures, are naturally represented as heterogeneous graphs, where nodes belong to different types and have additional features. For example, in a citation network, nodes representing "Paper" or "Author" may include attributes like keywords or affiliations. A critical machine learning task on these graphs is node classification, which is useful for applications such as fake news detection, corporate risk assessment, and molecular property prediction. Although Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs) perform well in these contexts, their predictions remain opaque. Existing post-hoc explanation methods lack support for actual node features beyond one-hot encoding of node type and often fail to generate realistic, faithful explanations. To address these gaps, we propose DiGNNExplainer, a model-level explanation approach that synthesizes heterogeneous graphs with realistic node features via discrete denoising diffusion. In particular, we generate realistic discrete features (e.g., bag-of-words features) using diffusion models within a discrete space, whereas previous approaches are limited to continuous spaces. We evaluate our approach on multiple datasets and show that DiGNNExplainer produces explanations that are realistic and faithful to the model's decision-making, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at WWW 2026.
